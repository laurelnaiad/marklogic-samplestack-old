{"Body":"<p>Linguistics classes seem to be mostly concerned with analyzing language in its spoken form. Written language is seen as almost \"parasitic\" to spoken language. A language's orthography generally gives an unreliable reflection of its structure. As such, I've been told that you only need to examine language in its spoken form to understand its morphology. However, I feel that this is a rather myopic approach to morphological analysis. For example, consider the relationship between the words 'sign' and 'signify'. Note that 'sign' has a silent 'g', where 'signify' does not. Casually browsing the online etymology dictionary, you can observe that the Latin word 'signum' evolved the old french word 'signe', which evolved into 'sign', which in turn evolved into 'signify'. The orthography, though unstandardized at the time, may explain how /g/ remained recessive in 'sign' and was transferred to 'signified'. I understand that pronunciation was very different in the early 13c, and that this probably is not a very good example. (I know nothing about historical linguistics.) There are probably other processes at work for my specific example. But I hope you can understand the concept which I am trying to convey. Why don't we consider a language's orthography when doing morphological analysis?</p>\n", "Id":"6210", "LastEditorUserId":"2831", "Title":"To what extent is a language's morphology tied to orthography, and why do we not consider orthography when doing morphological analysis?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-21T01:21:36.703", "OwnerUserId":"2831", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><orthography><written-language><morphological-analysis>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-22T01:47:33.007", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"19", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2831", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2a13t.png", "AccountId":"3690291", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"85", "CreationDate":"2013-12-06T04:40:53.813", "DisplayName":"RECURSIVE FARTS", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T06:28:34.987", "AboutMe":"<p><code>Fart phrase = FP</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Fart = F</code> </p>\n\n<p><code>FP = F(FP)</code></p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"97", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-22T05:20:57.447", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"19", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2831", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2a13t.png", "AccountId":"3690291", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"85", "CreationDate":"2013-12-06T04:40:53.813", "DisplayName":"RECURSIVE FARTS", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T06:28:34.987", "AboutMe":"<p><code>Fart phrase = FP</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Fart = F</code> </p>\n\n<p><code>FP = F(FP)</code></p>\n"}}
