{"Body":"<p>In Brazil, the Portuguese dialects spoken in rural areas preserve, despite their own innovations, several features of the language that were common in the 16th century. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the so called “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipira\" rel=\"nofollow\">caipira dialect</a>”. These conservative features include  phonological, lexical and semantic aspects, and are considered archaisms in the modern standard dialect. On the other hand, a number of innovations in Brazilian Portuguese originated in the more urbanized areas (southeast region, especially São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and then spread to the rest of the country. </p>\n\n<p>On another geographic scale, Brazilian Portuguese as a whole is considered rather conservative, when compared to European Portuguese. Historically, until the 19th century, Brazil remained as basically an agrarian economy, while Portugal was the urbanized colonial center.</p>\n\n<p>Evidently, this is not a scientific observation (so it may be strongly biased), but it seems that urbanization and the rate of language change are somehow correlated. Is that a fact?</p>\n", "Id":"1188", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1193", "Title":"Is urbanization correlated with language innovation?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-21T13:42:23.413", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><sociolinguistics>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-10T00:20:35.570", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
