{"Body":"<p>It isn't definitely a \"linguistic\" question, but I hope there're some people who solved the same problems like me.</p>\n\n<p>Since of my childhood I was very curious in languages and linguistics, but I hadn't enough money to study abroad and universities with good linguistics faculties. Finally I was graduating in computer programming and worked in software engeneering since I was graduated.</p>\n\n<p>I want to ffind a way to connect both of my interests, but I don't know anyone who tried it, and I'm not sure about current situation in this field. For example, as long as I know, the spellchecking and parsing the search requests are well-developed enough and these problems are almost solved.</p>\n\n<p>So, only a great research or a new university degree can help me with finding my place in that field. But is it possible from online courses, or I have to join \"full-time\" university (the second is impossible, I think :(). The thing is I don't know anyone who worked with such a problems (all of the linguists I know studied culture, histore, etc of the countries).</p>\n", "Id":"4670", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Studying Linguistics for a Programmer", "CreationDate":"2013-10-09T09:25:54.760", "OwnerUserId":"2567", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><reference-request><nlp>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-09T14:00:50.737", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
