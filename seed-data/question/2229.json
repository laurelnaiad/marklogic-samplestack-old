{"OwnerDisplayName":"Dov F", "Body":"<p>I originally posted this a while ago on <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2011/11/vayeitzei-origin-of-word-god.html\">my blog</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.needaneitzah.com/questions/23/what-are-some-english-words-that-are-taken-from-lashon-hakodesh#52\">someone</a> recently suggested that I pose it as a question here.</p>\n\n<p>A brief <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God#Etymology_and_usage\">Wikipedia</a> search on the origin of the word ‘god’ reveals the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The earliest written form of the Germanic word god comes from the 6th\n  century Christian Codex Argenteus. The English word itself is derived\n  from the Proto-Germanic * ǥuđan. Most linguists agree that the\n  reconstructed Proto-Indo-European form * ǵhu-tó-m was based on the\n  root * ǵhau(ə)-, which meant either ‘to call’ or ‘to invoke’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Google came up with <a href=\"http://wahiduddin.net/words/name_god.htm\">this link</a> which presents a survey of various sources that attempt to decipher the origin of the word. It begins with a short summary of its conclusion, which contains the following sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The word God is a relatively new European invention, which was never\n  used in any of the ancient Judaeo-Christian scripture manuscripts that\n  were written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek or Latin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am befuddled by the fact that they seem to have overlooked a very clear source.</p>\n\n<p>In Genesis 30:11 - we read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַתֹּאמֶר לֵאָה בגד \\ בָּא גָד</p>\n  \n  <p>And Leah said, \"<em>gad</em> has come.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Targum <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Pseudo-Jonathan\">[Pseudo-]</a>Jonathan interprets:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַאֲמַרַת לֵאָה אָתָא מַזְלָא טָבָא</p>\n  \n  <p>And Leah said, \"the good 'mazal' (astrological sign / luck) has come.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would assume that if ‘mazal’ = ‘gad’ then we could have a pretty good indication of where the word ‘god’ came from.</p>\n\n<p>If this isn’t good enough, note the word גדא which is mentioned several times in the Talmud. See, for example, Hullin 40a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר אביי לא קשיא הא דאמר להר הא דאמר לגדא דהר דיקא נמי דקתני דומיא\n  דמיכאל שר הגדול</p>\n  \n  <p>...Abbaye said, \"it is not problematic, for this is when he said [he\n  was slaughtering it] for the mountain and this is where he said it was\n  for the <em>gada</em> (referring some heavenly minister that some would serve\n  as a <em>god</em>) of the mountain...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is quite clear from the context that גדא דהר means just that; god of the mountain!</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any knowledge that would help in figuring out whether or not these words (גד and god) are actually related, as they seem to be?</p>\n", "Id":"2229", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"The Origin of the Word 'God'", "CreationDate":"2012-07-10T13:27:57.687", "OwnerUserId":"1176", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><etymology><hebrew><germanic-languages>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-01T16:29:47.407", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"3053", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-19T10:07:44.967", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1176", "AccountId":"1553528", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"154", "CreationDate":"2012-07-10T16:18:42.490", "DisplayName":"Dov F", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-27T00:35:47.343"}}
