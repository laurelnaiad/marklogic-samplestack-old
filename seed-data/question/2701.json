{"Body":"<p>As an occasional learner of these languages, I find the linguistic situation of Arabic, Persian and Turkish very interesting: they are three genetically unrelated languages (if you stick to unquestioned families, they are Semitic, Indo-European and Turkic, respectively) with quite different grammatical structures but, due to a complex history, there are subject to massive mutual lexical borrowing). </p>\n\n<p>The speakers' attitude towards this situation has changed a lot through history. As far as I can tell (mostly through interaction with my teachers), this remains today a burning issue in Iran and Turkey (at least much more burning than, say, the Romance borrowings in English).</p>\n\n<p>My question is: do you know good reference work about this situation? I'm interested in both the purely linguistic side (a good description of the situation, serious etymological dictionaries and so on) and the sociolinguistical side.</p>\n", "Id":"2701", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Mutual lexical borrowings between Arabic, Persian and Turkish: a reference request", "CreationDate":"2012-10-16T13:05:07.250", "OwnerUserId":"189", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><borrowing><arabic><lexicon><turkish>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"184", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-16T13:05:07.250", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"30", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"189", "AccountId":"924492", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"295", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T19:36:05.183", "DisplayName":"JPP", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-14T01:20:48.150", "AboutMe":"<p>My first language is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">some dialect of Latin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My last language is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCbatulabal_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tübatulabal</a> (<em>ex æquo</em>).</p>\n", "Age":"37"}}
