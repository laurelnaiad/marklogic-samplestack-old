{"Body":"<p>Is there a term for activities which are only ever accomplished by other activities? If I were to make up a term I'd call them <em>meta-activities</em>. Some examples of what I'm thinking of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>teaching - accomplished by explanations, demonstrations, quizzing, giving feedback</li>\n<li>cooking (potatoes) - accomplished by peeling some potatoes, dicing them, boiling them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While cooking has a primary sense of heating food, I'm not sure that teaching ever does - every example of teaching will be an example of other more basic actions.</p>\n\n<p>I've thought of hyponymy/hypernymy, but it's not the same. Explanation isn't a type of teaching, and not all explanations will teach. None of the other common lexical relations are appropriate either. Any ideas?</p>\n", "Id":"4637", "LastEditorUserId":"2555", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"What do you call an activity accomplished by other activities", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T09:59:39.497", "OwnerUserId":"2555", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><semantics><aktionsart>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-11T07:14:53.230", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"70", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"2555", "DownVotes":"16", "AccountId":"3401915", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"311", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:31:40.093", "DisplayName":"curiousdannii", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T22:35:43.143", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"173", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-11T07:14:53.230", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"70", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"2555", "DownVotes":"16", "AccountId":"3401915", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"311", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:31:40.093", "DisplayName":"curiousdannii", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T22:35:43.143", "AboutMe":""}}
