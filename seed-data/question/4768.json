{"Body":"<p>Let someone wants to know what some word (concrete as \"chair\" or abstract as \"happiness\") mean. What methods, experimental techniques are there for extracting word's meaning? I found next ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Study appropriate entries at various <strong>dictionaries</strong> (defining vocabulary, philosophical/psychological/sociological dictionaries)</li>\n<li>Just ask enough <strong>native speakers</strong> about what researched word mean</li>\n<li>Study of <strong>context</strong> in which the word occurs</li>\n<li>Make <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Componential_analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>componential</strong> analysis</a></li>\n<li>Make <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_differential\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>semantic</strong> differential</a> experiment</li>\n<li>Make <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_by_association\" rel=\"nofollow\">linguistics <strong>association</strong></a> experiment</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It looks as if these methods have significant <em>disadvantages</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dictionaries are often too insufficient; if some really give a full description (that is rare), then same question: how the compilers get them?</li>\n<li>Asking native speakers looks very unreliable, subjectively way.</li>\n<li>Study of context is very widely. I didn't find any good examples of extracting meaning by this way.</li>\n<li>Componential analysis has no any rigorous algorithm.</li>\n<li>Semantic differential gives only connotative, emotional part of meaning.</li>\n<li>Linguistics association is too indirect method and requires too much interpretation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What other methods are there for the full extracting researched word meaning? In the end I want have <em>complete</em> description of researched word's meaning.</p>\n", "Id":"4768", "LastEditorUserId":"2518", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Methods for meaning extraction", "CreationDate":"2013-10-21T22:34:16.133", "OwnerUserId":"2518", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><lexical-semantics><methodology>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-22T14:26:02.780", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2518", "AccountId":"2750121", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"19", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T23:57:28.040", "DisplayName":"drobnbobn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-26T16:02:26.763"}, "ViewCount":"132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-25T23:04:08.147", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2518", "AccountId":"2750121", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"19", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T23:57:28.040", "DisplayName":"drobnbobn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-26T16:02:26.763"}}
