{"Body":"<p>Related to <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/51616/paucity-of-words-for-relationships\">a question at ELU</a>, I am interested in doing a comparative analysis of kinship terms in various languages. What would help me with this is an inventory of terms for individual languages.</p>\n\n<p>There are online explanations of different systems, but I haven't been able to find a list for many common languages (the main IE/Semitic/East Asian languages). Historical ones like Old English/Latin/PIE would be good, too.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a reference that tabulates the terms for each language? If not that, at least one that lists comprehensively the kinship terms with their definition in English?</p>\n", "Id":"1152", "LastEditorUserId":"76", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1153", "Title":"Are there any online databases of kinship terms across languages?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-14T18:34:48.863", "OwnerUserId":"4", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic><reference-request><vocabulary><kinship-terms>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-14T22:02:05.763", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"35", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/alekstorm", "Id":"76", "AccountId":"411223", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:34:32.303", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Urbana, IL", "DownVotes":"17", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1043", "DisplayName":"Alek Storm", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T07:20:27.393"}, "ViewCount":"201", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-21T17:02:52.083", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"432", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"United States", "Id":"4", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"167219", "Views":"42", "Reputation":"1906", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:24:01.087", "DisplayName":"Mitch", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T11:56:51.610", "AboutMe":"<p>Native speaker of American English (AmE) with touches of Southern AmE.\nProficient in French and German.
