{"Body":"<p><em>Perhaps this question has been asked before, I may have looked for the wrong terms then because I haven't found the answer.</em></p>\n\n<p>I would like to know more about the usage of the present tense in sentences expressing the future. What is it called? Does it really express future in the same way as the future tense would? Or is there a nuance? Is it a wide spread phenomenon across languages?</p>\n\n<p>I am especially interested at this practice in French, as with the examples below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Je déménage demain.<br>\n  Je vais manger avec Nicolas ce soir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2593", "Title":"What is the present tense expressing future?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-22T12:26:19.863", "AnswerCount":"4", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"682", "Tags":"<french><tense><present>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"189", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-23T15:52:08.207", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"11", "WebsiteUrl":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/717441/benjamin", "Id":"682", "AccountId":"369843", "CreationDate":"2012-01-17T21:01:13.080", "AboutMe":"<p>As a student in South Asian languages, culture and history, specialising in comparative cultures and cognitive science, I take special interest in the influence of cultural paradigms in the perception and interaction with the world in terms of development.\nI am also a polyglot with a strong passion for learning languages, including programming languages such as Python.
