{"Body":"<p>The word (pl. <strong><em>баре,</em></strong> ['bа:rʲe]) is roughly rendered into English as 'gentry' meaning 'a noble person without a position at imperial court'. The <em>boyar</em> is possibly not a cognate.</p>\n\n<p>What surprises me the most is that the word <strong><em>bár</em></strong> in Old Irish (especially in its poetic speech, or in <em>bérla na filed</em>) had meant <em>´a wise chief'</em>, while the most ancient Irish sources provide a word for ´<strong><em>bárnía</em></strong>', or <em>´wise warrior´</em>, and this word is even more resemblant to the Russian <strong><em>´barin´</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The word барон 'baron' is not a possible source, because it does not coincide with the plural form (<strong><em>бароны &lt;=барон</em></strong> VS <strong><em>барин => баре</em></strong>). However, the plural of <strong><em>боярин</em></strong> is <em>бояре</em>, which suggests a pattern, but does not explain the intervocal [j] in  <em>boyar</em>. What is the etymology of <strong><em>boyar</em></strong>, by the way?</p>\n\n<p>Hence, the question is: are there any reliable etymologucal sources (please do not quote any Vasmer or the like) which might help me in shedding some light on this issue?</p>\n", "Id":"6191", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "Title":"What is the origin of Russian барин ['bа:rʲin]?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-18T18:23:56.037", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><indo-european><slavic-languages><celtic><wonderwort>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-19T09:04:01.250", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
