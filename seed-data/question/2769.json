{"Body":"<p>I'm interested if there is a text or set of texts where each word is correctly POS tagged.\nI know there are algorithms that can associate POS tags to the words, but there are always many of incorrectly tagged words, which are ambiguous and context sensitive.\nThese errors could be only handled at the time the text is created by some clever editor and the author of the text would clarify the POS tags of words that could be ambiguous in particular context.\nSo, the result would be the text where all POS tags are correct.</p>\n\n<p>Could you recommend some research material dealing with creation (possibly computer AI assistance) of unambiguous texts by some clever editor which could be further processed on the semantic level?</p>\n\n<p>Is there such a corpus or set of texts available on the Internet, which are created by this tool?</p>\n", "Id":"2769", "LastEditorUserId":"1111", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Tool for manually POS tagging texts", "CreationDate":"2012-10-29T20:02:42.917", "OwnerUserId":"1111", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<semantics><corpora><parts-of-speech>", "AnswerCount":"0", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-30T08:49:56.320", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1111", "AccountId":"329709", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"136", "CreationDate":"2012-06-17T16:02:06.303", "DisplayName":"xralf", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-31T19:42:38.600"}, "ViewCount":"100", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-30T13:22:26.297", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1111", "AccountId":"329709", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"136", "CreationDate":"2012-06-17T16:02:06.303", "DisplayName":"xralf", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-31T19:42:38.600"}}
