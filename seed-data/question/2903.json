{"Body":"<p>Unlike Chinese and Japanese, Korean does employ spaces between words.</p>\n\n<p>What constitutes a lexical word differs from what constitutes an orthographic word. For instance, particles which can is some ways be compared to English prepositions, are written suffixed or cliticized to the end of a word.</p>\n\n<p>My Korean is very rudimentary to say the least but I believe I have seen in printed Korean the particle <code>Ïùò</code> (\"of\" or \"'s\") at the beginning of the next line when the noun it would normally be attached to came at the end of the previous line.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know is this the only place that Korean orthographic words can be separated?
