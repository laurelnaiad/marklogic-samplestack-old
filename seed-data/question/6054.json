{"Body":"<p>my question concerns languages with clause chaining - that form sentences composed of a string of non-finite medial clauses followed by a finite final clause, or a finite initial clause followed by a string of non-finite sequential clauses. Languages such as Turkish, Korean, etc.</p>\n\n<p>What are typically the semantic constraints of clauses which may be chained together in this way? Is it typical for them to have to all take the same logical (though obviously not marked) aspect, mood, voice, etc.? Must there be a uniform semantic relation between them, such as a sequence of events where there is a \"then\" relation between clauses, or a conjunction where there is an \"and\" relation between them? How strict or loose are the constraints governing what clauses can come in a single chain and when a new chain must be started?</p>\n", "Id":"6054", "Title":"Semantic Variability of Clause Chaining?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-02T05:46:38.660", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<semantics><clauses>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"40", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-02T05:46:38.660", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/JustinOlbrantz", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1097", "AccountId":"1561933", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"470", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.637", "DisplayName":"Justin Olbrantz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:48:30.797"}}
