{"Body":"<p>When a loanword enters a language, does it usually replace an existing native word or phrase? Or does it more often lead to an increase in the size of the language's vocabulary?</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Japanese's influence on English, most of the words are new words describing concepts that did not exist before, such as karaoke, kimono, and sushi, with only the occasional word replacing existing terms (tsunami replacing \"tidal wave\"). I'm curious as to whether most loanwords are like this, or whether it indicates that Japanese has had a rather weak influence on English compared to other languages' influence on English.</p>\n", "Id":"3070", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3071", "Title":"Do loanwords usurp existing words?", "CreationDate":"2013-01-13T10:58:35.690", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<borrowing>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"421", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"215", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-21T07:31:57.540", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"21", "WebsiteUrl":"http://andrewjgrimm.wordpress.com/", "Id":"421", "AccountId":"17355", "CreationDate":"2011-10-14T12:12:21.327", "AboutMe":"<p>I work at the University of New South Wales, where I use Ruby to analyze biological data.</p>\n\n<p>In part of my spare time, I work on fun programming projects.
