{"Body":"<p>I am currently trying to learn Tamil. </p>\n\n<p>My friend who is teaching me seems to be making a clicking sound with one word in particular, and she can't seem to tell she's making it.</p>\n\n<p>The word is குளம் pronounced as [kʊ˞ɭʼʌm] - meaning pool or pond.</p>\n\n<p>Every time she says it my mind is blown when she transitions from the retroflex ɭ to the ʌ. </p>\n\n<p>The distance between these two sounds seems to be the maximum possible distance it can travel between two sounds. It's as if the tongue is slammed into the floor of the mouth causing a click-type sound. About 50% of the time she says the word I can hear a distinct click.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if any phonologists out there have noticed these kinds of unintentional click sounds in any languages.</p>\n\n<p>Also, at what point would a click serve some sort of contrastive phoneme? Is it even possible for a language as old as Tamil to develop clicks?</p>\n", "Id":"6335", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6337", "Title":"Do some words have secondary or unintended click consonants?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-07T17:27:40.940", "OwnerUserId":"740", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><phonemes><dravidian><click>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-07T17:45:40.803", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
