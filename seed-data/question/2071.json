{"Body":"<p>I am not sure how one can <em>see</em> the difference between these three. I can give an example of the three - respectively <em>come in</em>, <em>went into</em> and <em>got along without</em> - but I don't know why these are what they are. Can some one explain these terms as clearly and simplistic as possible?</p>\n\n<p>An example of how I am confused:\nOne could state that a phrasal verb consists of a verb and an adverbial participle. Sure he can. But how does he know that that adverbial participle (e.g. <em>in</em>) is not a preposition?</p>\n\n<p>I do think that the following is true to make a distinction: when talking of a prepostional verb, there can't be any syntactic spot between the verb and the participle. E.g. <strong>They called him up</strong> (Phrasal) <strong>They called on him</strong> (Prepositional) Would that be a possibility? Or is that rubbish?</p>\n", "Id":"2071", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2072", "Title":"Difference Phrasal Verb, Prepositional Verb and Prepositional Phrasal Verb", "CreationDate":"2012-06-07T16:38:53.690", "OwnerUserId":"1082", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><verbs>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-07T19:52:43.250", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"458", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-07T20:10:57.737", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/1057670719/picture?type=large", "Id":"1082", "AccountId":"1174306", "CreationDate":"2012-06-07T16:38:25.203", "AboutMe":"<p>Thank you for stopping by!
