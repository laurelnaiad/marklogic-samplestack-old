{"Body":"<p>I'm stuck understanding the difference between <em>argot</em> and <em>jargon</em>.</p>\n\n<p>According to many sources, e.g. Wikipedia:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Argot</strong> is a secret language used by various groups—including, but not limited to, thieves and other criminals—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Jargon</strong> is terminology which is especially defined in relationship to a specific activity, profession, group, or event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My confusion is based on reading that the term of <em>argot</em> has appeared to describe a language of lower class young people in France. Can't recall the link, however.</p>\n\n<p>Do they both refer the same term?<br>\nTo be specific, computer professionals speak with argot or with jargon?<br>\nTo be even more specific, let's stick to a community of computer pro's whose native language is other than English.
