{"Body":"<p>In Czech poetry you can say something like this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"zvukem kulek k tobe promlouvam\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>which is <strong>\"I speak to you with(through) the sound of bullets/shots\"./\"Mluvim k tobe se(skrz) zvukem(zvuk) kulek.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>But you cannot say:\n<strong>The sounds of bullets to you (I) speak\"/\"zvukem kulek k tobe promlouvam\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Because <strong>\"The sounds of bullets\"</strong> is always nominative case in EN, even though that it's the combination of instrumental and genitive.:</p>\n\n<p>zvukem = instrumental (kym?/<strong>cim?</strong> zvukem)</p>\n\n<p>kulek  = genitive (koho? <strong>ceho?</strong> kulek)</p>\n\n<p><strong>In English it's nominative, no matter what</strong> ;), at least in the written form. I don't know how the EN people translate it in their brains.</p>\n\n<p>The solution would be something like:\n<strong>\"Them soundems of bullets to yoem speakujem/speakuji\".</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-em</strong> would be the indicator of instrumental case ;D.</p>\n\n<p>So, e.g. I see EN as very weak competitor in e.g. poetry when compared with languages that use cases (most of Slavic languages, German, Latin, Sanskrit etc.) , because you have everything just in nominative. And sometimes genitive (man's house).</p>\n\n<p>Another advantage of cases is answering to the questions:</p>\n\n<p>Q: \"Jak jste se tam dostal?\" / \"How do you get there?\"</p>\n\n<p>A: \"Vlakem\". / \"By train\"</p>\n\n<p>So, the EN <strong>\"By train\"</strong> would be in Czech <strong>\"S vlak\"</strong> which is robot-like talk. </p>\n\n<p>You need to use the correct case not the nominative. </p>\n\n<p>The correct case for this example is instrumental so it could be <strong>\"S vlakem\"</strong>, which is perfectly fine, but we always drop the <strong>\"s\"/\"with(or by)\"</strong> because we know that from the word <strong>vlakEM</strong>. \"EM\" told us that it's instrumental. </p>\n\n<p>It's a little more complicated in real sitautaions, because you have multiple genders and <strong>14 paradigms of noun declension/Slovak has 15</strong> ;D.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, EN is great for the students, they just need to learn the 1 one word for singular and 1 word for plural ;) and there is in most cases the difference just -s in plural.</p>\n\n<p>You have <strong>4 - 7</strong> or more different sound possibilities and if you multiply that with 3 genders (<strong>14 paradigms of noun declension</strong> in Cezch) and combine that for 4 or 5 words  in the sentence the number of combination is enourmous when compared with English. Not to mention the word order (notice that we are using in all cases just the same 3 words) ;D: </p>\n\n<p>Češi udělali <strong>revoluci</strong> (The Czechs made a revolution -> stress on \"revolution/revoluci\") </p>\n\n<p><em>OR</em></p>\n\n<p>Revoluci udělali <strong>Češi</strong> (It was the Czechs who made the revolution -> stress on \"Czechs/Češi\")</p>\n\n<p><em>OR</em> </p>\n\n<p>Češi revoluci <strong>udělali</strong> (The Czechs did make a revolution -> stress on \"did/udělali)</p>\n\n<p>which creates even more possibilities in poetry.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how do native English speakers translate the nominative cases in their brains? Does it stay there in nominative. or they translate it to causality-like grammatical cases form?</p>\n", "Id":"4135", "ClosedDate":"2013-08-22T10:21:12.377", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"How do English people understand the grammatical cases?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-08T07:17:46.723", "OwnerUserId":"2182", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><english><cases><poetry>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-09T03:04:08.133", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"261", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-09T03:34:21.960", "Score":"-1", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2182", "AccountId":"1344851", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-06-23T19:29:52.753", "DisplayName":"Derfder", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T20:11:11.777", "AboutMe":"<p>Derfder is my name ;)</p>\n"}}
