{"Body":"<p>Are there examples of creole languages that have had three or more other languages as parents without intermediate two-language creoles? If they exist, then how high is the 'or more', i.e. what is the largest n such that a direct n-language creole exists? If the answer is no, is there a fundamental reason for this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This question is partially motivated by thinking for the reproductive part of <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/392/33\">Evolution of languages</a></p>\n", "Id":"551", "AcceptedAnswerId":"554", "Title":"Are there creoles of three languages?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T05:27:42.757", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><theoretical-linguistics><evolution><creoles>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"33", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"138", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-27T08:04:09.090", "Score":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"125", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akazna/", "Id":"33", "AccountId":"459207", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:58:42.087", "AboutMe":"<p>From the School of Computer Science and Department of Psychology at McGill University, I marvel at the world through algorithmic lenses.
