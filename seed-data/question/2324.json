{"Body":"<p>I've been reading <a href=\"http://lingo.stanford.edu/sag/papers/fillmore%2B88.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> article about linguistic idiomaticity, and there's a good research on English idioms and indirect speech, in general.</p>\n\n<p>I've been thinking on different amounts of idiomaticity in various languages. I haven't seen any academic researches that would compare languages side-by-side, but my naive assumption was the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isolating languages have fewer amount of stems (usually limited by phonetics), so they should expose <em>higher amount of idiomaticity</em>.<br>\n  Synthetic ones naturally have broader morphology, so there should be higher chance finding special words for individual terms, therefore, <em>lower amount of idiomaticity</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are lots of examples proving this assumption. However, there are exceptions that confuse me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>English: yesterday; it has a complicated etymology, but generally it's a single term nowadays, matches the rule<br>\n  Ukrainian: вчора - single term, matches the rule<br>\n  Thai: เมื่อวานนี้, literally <code>at the time</code> + <code>day</code> +<code>this</code>, idiomatic term, matches the rule<br>\n  <strong>Chinese</strong>: 昨 - single term, does <strong>not</strong> match the rule</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chinese: 多少, lit. <code>a lot</code> + <code>a few</code>, idiomatic term, matches the rule;<br>\n  Thai: เท่าไหร่, lit. <code>amount classifier</code> + <code>what</code> - idiomatic term, matches the rule;<br>\n  Ukrainian: скільки - a single term, matches the rule;<br>\n  <strong>English</strong>: \"How much\" - idiomatic term, does <strong>not</strong> match the rule</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, the question: is there any pattern on how various languages expose idiomaticity and indirection? I'm also wondering if there's any academic research on this matter.</p>\n", "Id":"2324", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "Title":"Linguistic idiomaticity in different languages", "CreationDate":"2012-07-31T17:14:53.133", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<comparative-linguistics><idiomaticity>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-01T19:24:35.227", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "ViewCount":"215", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-01T19:24:35.227", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
