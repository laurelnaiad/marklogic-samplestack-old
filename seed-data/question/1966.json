{"Body":"<p>The wh- questions in sign languages crosslinguistically can be seen in clause-initial or clause-final position or in both positions. They can be seen in one of the positions in question sentence, like in the example from Austrian Sign Language (ÖGS):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>wo    ball\nwhere ball  \n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p><em>Where is the ball?</em></p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/sll/2006/00000009/f0020001/art00007\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schalber, 2006</a>, p. 142)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Schalber (2006) has pointed in her paper that clause-initial is the default position for the wh- signs in ÖGS. However, the wh-signs can be seen in both positions at the same time. This means that they can be doubled, as in the example below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>was    will    kaufen   was  \nwhat   want    buy      what\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p><em>What do you want to buy?</em>  </p>\n  \n  <p>(Schalber, 2006, p. 143)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She has not mention whether there is a condition or not in which doubled questions has occured. So, my question is whether doubled questions are abtirary. Is there a condition in which they have occured?</p>\n", "Id":"1966", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Are doubled questions in sign languages arbitrary?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-20T13:55:17.157", "OwnerUserId":"640", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sign-languages><interrogatives>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-20T14:54:48.177", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
