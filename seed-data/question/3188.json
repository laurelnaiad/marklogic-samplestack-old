{"Body":"<p>It occurred to me that what we hear and interpret as speech is often an inarticulate garble of phonemes that native speakers process with lightning speed (usually) to come up with a clear and specific meaning.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in English if you are a native speaker and you hear</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yerg'nahaftagedoudaherenow!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>you probably parse it instantly and correctly as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You're going to have to get out of here now!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But non-native speakers would be completely flummoxed unless there were sufficient contextual clues—angry face, threatening or warning gestures, tone of voice—to make most of the meaning clear.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering how much of this post-processing is based on pattern recognition, how much is contextual or modal or extra-linguistic, and so on. Certainly if I were to bring up an abstruse topic out of the blue, and spoke in a similarly rapid and inarticulate manner, comprehension would go way down, even for native speakers.</p>\n", "Id":"3188", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "Title":"To what extent is aural language comprehension based on a post-processing model, and what are the factors involved?", "CreationDate":"2013-02-11T18:18:47.113", "OwnerUserId":"171", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<untagged>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-11T19:17:41.473", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
