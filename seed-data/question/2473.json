{"Body":"<p>Inspired by <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/2469/what-is-the-current-understanding-of-greenbergs-classification-of-african-langu\">this recent question on Greenberg's classification of African languages</a>, I wonder about the <strong>current state of classification of the American languages</strong>. (By \"American\" I mean the indigenous pre-Columbian languages and their descendants). </p>\n\n<p>Greenberg controversially proposed just three macrofamilies of American languages (Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Den√©, and the \"everything else\" family Amerind) but this seems to have been some significantly flawed research. The <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=h36tPYqAZPwC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=etmvtvlolP&amp;dq=voegelin%20and%20voegelin%201965%20consensus&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=voegelin%20and%20voegelin%201965%20consensus&amp;f=false\">1964 \"Consensus\" Classification</a> classified 16 phyla; and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgyDAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Campbell+%26+Mithun+%281979%29&amp;dq=Campbell+%26+Mithun+%281979%29&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXa7k4vyqy&amp;sig=x3RwUcBP06_c62YmxICvgjadawY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aHQ-UODoIoLkqgGm2YCgCA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw\">Campbell and Mithun's 1979 \"Black Book\"</a> took a conservative approach resulting in dozens of likely families and many isolates. </p>\n\n<p>I'm asking for a summary of the current state of research in this area. I'm not trying to start a lumper vs. splitter discussion, nor am I looking for popular-press summaries but for a sense of what's currently going on in scholarly work.</p>\n", "Id":"2473", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"What is the current understanding of the classification of indigenous American languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-29T20:05:07.243", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><language-families><american-languages>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-30T09:34:36.080", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"128", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-30T09:34:36.080", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
