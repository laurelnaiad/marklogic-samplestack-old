{"Body":"<p>Can anybody provide me with a definition of \"oracle information\" as it's used in NLP and machine learning?  I've come across the term in in sentiment analysis, wsd, mt, and in a number of other areas but haven't been able to find a definition of the term. Here is some context:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In a section of a thesis dealing with automated classification of discourse relations, the author describes oracle information in terms that are indistinguishable from \"supervised.\" To predict Z, manually annotated discourse segments X and Y serve as \"oracles\" to the classifier.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a paper dealing with a two-stage classification task (first classify a sentence as subjective/not subjective, then classify all subjective sentences as x or y) the tags from stage 1 are described as \"oracles\"--so, output from the stages of a hierarchical classifier is oracle information for later stages?</p></li>\n<li><p>In a paper dealing with named entity recognition, the authors use word alignment information as an oracle. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, can anyone provide a decent definition for the term along with an example?</p>\n", "Id":"4061", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4173", "Title":"What is the definition of \"oracle information\"?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-25T16:25:37.543", "OwnerUserId":"2285", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><computational-linguistics><nlp>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-26T14:30:04.840", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
