{"Body":"<p>I'm looking for examples of typological traits that are common in languages of the Americas and rare in languages elsewhere.  Traits could be at any level of description &mdash; phonological, morphosyntactic, semantic, whatever.  </p>\n\n<p><b>Edit</b> To clarify, I don't need to find traits that are common <em>throughout</em> the Americas.  It would be enough to say, for instance, \"XYZ is quite common in Mesoamerica, and it's rare everywhere else, including the rest of the Americas and all of the Old World.\"  </p>\n\n<p>(I'm looking for examples in support of the idea that it's important to do research on languages of the Americas.  I'd like to go beyond the general principle that typological balance is A Good Thing, and be able to pull out a few concrete examples of the form \"If we'd never studied languages of the Americas, we wouldn't know about XYZ.\")</p>\n", "Id":"1236", "LastEditorUserId":"306", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1260", "Title":"Traits that are common in the Americas and rare elsewhere", "CreationDate":"2012-01-07T20:32:18.567", "OwnerUserId":"306", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<linguistic-typology>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-09T23:03:42.217", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"177", "WebsiteUrl":"http://comp.ling.utexas.edu/~dvelleman", "Id":"306", "AccountId":"936287", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T13:37:21.977", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a grad student in linguistics, interested in semantics, pragmatics and prosody and currently doing fieldwork on K'iche' (a very cool Mayan language spoken in Guatemala).  </p>\n\n<p>Off the clock, I'm also interested in figuring out <em>why the heck we teach this stuff</em> &mdash; or in other words, why do people care about linguistics who don't do it for a living, what their interests are, and what they want to learn or get out of our classes.
