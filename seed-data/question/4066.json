{"Body":"<p>This is from Wikipedia:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An interesting aspect of Akatek grammar, which is also present in most\n  other Q'anjobalan languages, is the use of directional morphemes,\n  which appear as enclitics. These morphemes make it possible for the\n  speaker to talk about movement and direction in space <strong>without pointing\n  or using other gestures</strong>. Consider the stative verb [ʔej] to be, which\n  can appear as [ʔejʔok] existing inwards, [ʔejtok] <strong>existing towards\n  there, away from the speaker and listener</strong> and [ʔeːltox] existing from\n  the inside out, using different enclitics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am having trouble understanding how a word can express direction if the speaker and listener may be facing each other, sitting/standing side by side, or even back to back.  </p>\n", "Id":"4066", "Title":"How do directional morphemes work independant of relative positions of the speaker and listener?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-27T18:40:54.550", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1712", "Tags":"<morphology><morphological-analysis>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"53", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-27T22:02:40.820", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1712", "AccountId":"499437", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"148", "CreationDate":"2013-01-29T05:58:33.357", "DisplayName":"Fred", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-08T16:00:50.113"}}
