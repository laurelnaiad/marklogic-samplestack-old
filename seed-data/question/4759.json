{"Body":"<p>Normally, copulas hold a subject complement (or a predicate in any case). Example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>The sky became clear.\nI am ill.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But what is in the definition of a lexical verb that makes copulas lexical verbs? </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As the comments point out, I ought to be more specific.</p>\n\n<p>I have recently read an article of French linguist Pollock. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pollock, Jean-Yves. 1989. Verb movement, UG, and the structure of IP.\n  Linguistic Inquiry 20, 365-424.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He claims that the differences between English and French with respect to syntax of sentence negation, questions, adverbs, floating quantifiers and “quantification at a distance” are correlated. He proves this in various ways. One thing that bothers me, though, is that he seems to contrast copulae and auxiliaries, but in such a strange way I have never heard of before.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples (from Pollock, aforementioned).</p>\n\n<p><strong>French</strong> infinitives:</p>\n\n<p><code>1.</code> <em>être</em> (to be) and <em>avoir</em> (to have)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ne pas être heureux est une condition pour écrire des romans.</li>\n<li><em>Ne</em> to not be happy is a prerequisite for writing novels.</li>\n<li>N'être pas heureux est une condition pour écrire des romans.</li>\n<li>'<em>Ne</em> to be not happy ...' </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can see, the negation in French can be in front or after the verb (a copula). More correctly, it is the verb that moves to Infl - in front of the negation - or not. Verb Movement is possible, but not obligatory in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Then Pollock continues by saying \"Let us now consider lexical verbs. The situation here contrasts sharply with the paradigm [in the previous examples].\"</p>\n\n<p><code>2.</code> Lexical verbs</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ne pas sembler heureux est une condition pour écrire des romans.</li>\n<li>'<em>Ne</em> not seem happy is a prerequisite for writing novels.'</li>\n<li>*Ne sembler pas heureux est une condition pour écrire des romans.</li>\n<li>'<em>Ne</em> to seem not happy ...'</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(<strong>*</strong> meaning \"not considered standard language\" or simply not possible)</p>\n\n<p>This tendency in infinitives \"sort-of\" aligns with <strong>English</strong> tensed clauses.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He is not happy.</li>\n<li>*He seems not happy.</li>\n<li>He was not arredsted.</li>\n<li>*He got not arrested.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\"It appears that although Verb Movement can apply to auxiliaries and lexical <em>avoir</em>, it cannot apply to lexical verbs in infinitives in French.\"</p>\n\n<p>Without going further into detail, it struck me that Pollock seems to make a distinction between <em>to be</em> (and French <em>être</em>) - which seems to be an auxiliary, according to his theory - and <em>to seem</em> (and French sembler) as a lexical verb. Even though, my gut tells me that <em>être</em> in <code>1.</code> and in <em>He is not happy</em> is as good a copula as <em>sembler</em> or *<em>He seems not happy.</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"4759", "LastEditorUserId":"1082", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4762", "Title":"Are all copulas lexical verbs?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-20T10:36:34.063", "OwnerUserId":"1082", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<verbs><copula>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-21T09:13:39.763", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/1057670719/picture?type=large", "Id":"1082", "AccountId":"1174306", "CreationDate":"2012-06-07T16:38:25.203", "AboutMe":"<p>Thank you for stopping by!
