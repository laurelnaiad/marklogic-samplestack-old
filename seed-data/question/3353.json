{"Body":"<p>I'm reading a document about \"The Proclamation of Henry III\", in which the text is presented and a short commentary and glossary follow.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in the survival of some of the distinct verbal inflections classes of Old English. \nIn particular, I'm referring to the verbs \"swerien\", \"makien\" and \"werien\": I noticed that these particular verbs ends in <em>-ien</em>, while the usual suffix of the infinitive/subjunctive verbal forms in the text is <em>-en</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In the glossary, I came across some dictionary-like entries, such as this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>swerien</strong>, 4, swear, 3 p. pi. subj. after <em>hoaten</em> ; ags. <em>swerian</em> \ninf., <em>swerion</em> subj. ; ge. <em>sweren</em>; p. 85. Str. 560.</p>\n\n<p>Can you help me to find out what is special about these verbs?</p>\n", "Id":"3353", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"Particular verbal inflection classes in \"The Proclamation of Henry III\"", "CreationDate":"2013-03-11T08:31:43.807", "OwnerUserId":"1845", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><english>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-11T13:41:47.517", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
