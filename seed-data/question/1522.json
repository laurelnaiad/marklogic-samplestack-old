{"Body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Cartago tem que ser destruída.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Carthage must be destroyed.\" I'm wondering about the infinitive (<em>ser</em>): where does it come from? In what situations is the infinitive used after <em>que</em>: only with <em>ter + que</em>, or also with other verbs?</p>\n\n<p>It looks strange to me, because I don't know of any similar construction in the other Romance languages. But it is not at all unlikely that I missed parallels: does a similar construction exist in any of them?</p>\n\n<p>I know it doesn't exist in Latin: so in what way could it have developed from Latin constructions? Is it perhaps a combination of <em>quod</em> and the accusative with infinitive? I would appreciate any information that could help me put this construction in a broader perspective.</p>\n", "Id":"1522", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1556", "Title":"Why the infinitive in Portuguese \"Cartago tem que ser destruída\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-29T23:36:51.983", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<syntax><portuguese>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"82", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"449", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-22T15:37:05.793", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"18", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
