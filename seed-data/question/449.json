{"Body":"<p>Albanian has a digraph letter \"ll\" which is described as being similar to English \"dark l\".</p>\n\n<p>But how similar is it and how different? My native Australian English has dark l and to me it tends to turn into a \"w\" or \"u\" sound at the end of words and I'm not sure it's the same, maybe it varies a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are some more or less exotic sounds I know of but imperfectly in other languages, some which are also spelled with a version of \"l\" or \"ll\".</p>\n\n<p>Polish also has a \"w-ish l\" that is spelled with the letter \"Å‚\". But my hunch is that this one maybe used to be a kind of \"l\" but is now firmly a \"w\".</p>\n\n<p>I also speak Spanish but learned in Mexico where \"ll\" mostly sounds the same as \"y\" so that's also difficult to compare.</p>\n\n<p>Welsh also has a special letter they spelled with an \"ll\" digraph. It's said to be unique though and the way I produce it is very raspy so it would seem the least likely to be similar. But maybe I'm not doing it right since most Welsh people I meet can't speak Welsh anyway and are probably just humouring me.</p>\n\n<p>So which if any of these is Albanian \"ll\" most like?</p>\n", "Id":"449", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"450", "Title":"Is the \"ll\" in Albanian like the sounds in other languages?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T11:31:01.403", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><cross-linguistic><albanian><dark-l><laterals>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-17T04:49:10.630", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"260", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-17T04:49:10.630", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
