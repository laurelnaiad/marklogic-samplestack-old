{"Body":"<p>To clarify, <em>pre-positional</em> articles are the articles positioned <em>before</em> a noun they refer to, like English <em>the</em> or <em>a(n)</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Post-positional</em> articles are those positioned <em>after</em> a noun they refer to, like Swedish <em>-en/-ett</em>, or <em>-na</em> in <strong><em>en skog => skogen</em></strong> (forest => the forest), <strong><em>ett barn =>barnet</em></strong> (a child => the child),  Romanian <em>-l/-le</em> in <strong><em>codru => codrul</em></strong> (forest => the forest), or Bulgarian <em>-ът /-та / -то / -те</em>, e.g. <strong><em>гора = гората</em></strong> (forest => the forest), etc.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at the languages which have <em>pre-positional</em> articles (not to be confused with languages with articles merged into prepositions, like French <em>du</em>, or Italian <em>della</em>) but which have no <em>post-positional</em> articles, then we notice that these languages also have <em>zero articles</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_article_in_English#Zero_article\" rel=\"nofollow\">English, the zero articles</a> are used with mass noun singular.</p>\n\n<p>In French, the zero article (or <a href=\"http://books.google.ru/books/about/L_Article_Z%C3%A9ro_en_Fran%C3%A7ais_Contemporai.html?id=lskaSr4WCFQC&amp;redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow\">article zéro</a>) serves to denote 'neither massive nor countable' non-partitive noun (which, to my understanding, is somewhat similar to that of Sumerian types of plural).</p>\n\n<p>In Spanish, the zero article (or <a href=\"http://www.um.es/lincoing/jv/2002%20Contrastivo%20Carabela.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">artículo cero</a>) stands for non-possessivness (?) and group partitive.</p>\n\n<p>Dutch also has zero articles, although it is difficult to find any reliable work on this topic.</p>\n\n<p>What is the situation with <em>prepositional</em> zero articles in other languages?</p>\n", "Id":"3513", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "Title":"Do all languages with pre-positional articles have zero-articles if they don't have post-positional articles?", "CreationDate":"2013-04-09T20:00:06.577", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<comparative-linguistics><romance-languages><germanic-languages><slavic-languages>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-10T05:14:37.577", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
