{"Body":"<p>I asked a previous question related to this one about <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/2249/turn-penn-treebank-into-simpler-pos-tags\">parts of speech</a>.  I need to figure out what a determiner (DT) is in Penn Treebank Tag Set.  In the <a href=\"http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ccalas/tagsets/upenn.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">set examples</a> found in the tag set, it appears that a determiner is a mixture of articles and adjectives.  For my purposes articles and adjectives need to be separated.  </p>\n\n<p>Is a determiner in the Penn Treebank Tag Set considered just articles or a mixture of articles and adjectives?</p>\n", "Id":"2252", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"What is a determiner?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-15T02:10:25.987", "OwnerUserId":"607", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<parts-of-speech><determiners>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-15T10:14:26.087", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
