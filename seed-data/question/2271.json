{"Body":"<p>I'm new to NLP so bear with me if this isn't possible yet. I am interested in taking a sentence like 'He had a party at his house' to 'He hosted a party at his house' or simply the verb 'hosted'. Is this possible with current NLP technology or does this require deep semantic analysis that isn't currently available since it involves converting a nondescript verb into a descriptive one based on the receiving object?</p>\n", "Id":"2271", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2273", "Title":"How do I get 'hosted' from 'He had a party at his house'?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-19T02:27:31.990", "OwnerUserId":"1201", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<nlp><semantics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-19T10:43:48.450", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
