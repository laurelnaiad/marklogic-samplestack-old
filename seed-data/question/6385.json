{"Body":"<p>I want to parse a big list of variable and method names in code and recognise if those are (or are made up) out of real words - essentially, <strong>to recognise if they are obfuscated or not</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the idea is to build something that understands that the following are non-obfuscated names:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>VeryLongVarName</li>\n<li>counter</li>\n<li>my_iterator</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>but the following are obfuscated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>aaabbcc</li>\n<li>zAxX</li>\n<li>FDSLFUnmfs</li>\n<li>a</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This also needs going to be language independent - I am not focusing on recognising English (names could be French or anything)</p>\n\n<p>My idea is to extract some kind of metric out of each word and if within some ranges then its obfuscated. What do you think? </p>\n\n<p>What sort of metric could estimate this - for example randomness of characters?</p>\n\n<p>The whole thing doesn't need to be terribly accurate. If for a given code base it tells that out of 100 names tested, 20% <strong>seem to be</strong> obfuscated, then its good enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>(completely newbie to linguistics!)</p>\n", "Id":"6385", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6386", "Title":"how to recognise if a string is a real word", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T12:27:51.183", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<analysis>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"3019", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"36", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-13T13:36:04.370", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"3019", "AccountId":"3849720", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"8", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T12:27:51.183", "DisplayName":"John", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T11:25:48.567"}}
