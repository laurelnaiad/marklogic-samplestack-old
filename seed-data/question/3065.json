{"Body":"<p>I'm attempting to better understand what a control verb is. The <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/control_verb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia definition</a> seems clear enough.  But the definition in this other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article, about Control,</a> was harder for me to understand.  </p>\n\n<p>Here's one quote from the article whose meaning I need to learn...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Control predicates have semantic content; they semantically select their arguments, that is, their appearance strongly influences the nature of the arguments they take.[3] In this regard, they are much different from auxiliary verbs, which lack semantic content and do not semantically select arguments.\"   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is meant here by \"their appearance,\" i.e. the \"appearance\" of control verbs?   What aspect of the \"nature\" of the arguments do control verbs influence?   What does \"semantic selection\" mean in this context?</p>\n", "Id":"3065", "LastEditorUserId":"790", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3067", "Title":"What does it mean for a control verb to semantically select its arguments?", "CreationDate":"2013-01-12T07:34:42.767", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-12T19:19:49.880", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
