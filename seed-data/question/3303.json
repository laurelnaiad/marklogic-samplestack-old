{"Body":"<p>Suppose one person does not like one word or expression. He would have to use it though, so then he chooses a substitute. The majority of the people however use that word. </p>\n\n<p>Now, since one meaning of a word is the number of utterances in the society, that person consciously and intentionally changes the impact of the word in society. He chooses to do so, even if the impact is very small and perhaps limited to his lifetime.    </p>\n\n<p>It is a bit similar to an election where one votes for a candidate who by far will not win. Are there examples of people who do that? Is there a norm that one has or has not the right to choose the word of his like?</p>\n", "Id":"3303", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3305", "Title":"Are there people who intentionally refuse to use some words even if the majority does it?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-03T00:21:21.873", "OwnerUserId":"18", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<vocabulary><descriptive-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-03T17:49:48.297", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
