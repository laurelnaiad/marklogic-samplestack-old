{"Body":"<p>Walking with my wife the other day, I turned around and realized that the person behind me was, in fact, someone else, and my wife had stopped to look in a shop. I said to her</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1a Oh, I thought that guy behind me was you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Possibly because I had a bit of cognitive interference with \"Oh, I thought you were behind me\", I was tempted to say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1b Oh, I thought you were that guy behind me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But on reflection I realize that 1 sounds right (felicitous?), and 2 sounds wrong (infelicitous).</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit</em> I've used these terms from now on at P Elliot's suggestion</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As another example</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2a The boy thought the woman whose hand he was holding was his mother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is felicitous, while</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2b The boy thought his mother was the woman whose hand he was holding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is infelicitous</p>\n\n<p>However, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3a I thought that log was a bear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3b I thought that bear was a log.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both are felicitous, although they point to different meanings.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My thoughts so far: definiteness might be important – playing around with how things sound, \"a guy\" vs. \"the guy\" vs. \"that guy\" vs. \"something\" seems to shift things a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Alternately, maybe it has something to do with \"was you\" being qualitative rather than existential – that is, the meaning is not A=B but rather something closer to \"A is B-like\".</p>\n\n<p>Or, perhaps, some basic and fundamental aspect of semantics (/pragmatics?) that I'm forgetting/never learned.</p>\n", "Id":"4535", "LastEditorUserId":"2500", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4537", "Title":"\"I thought X was Y\" vs. \"I thought Y was X\"", "CreationDate":"2013-09-24T01:15:12.707", "OwnerUserId":"2500", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<semantics><pragmatics>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-25T22:34:15.880", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.robbie.eugraph.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg", "Id":"2500", "AccountId":"1119822", "CreationDate":"2013-09-24T01:14:12.593", "AboutMe":"<p>PhD Candidate in Ecology at Missouri Botanical Garden &amp; UM - St. Louis</p>\n", "Location":"St. Louis, MO", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"123", "DisplayName":"Oreotrephes", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-30T15:51:17.957"}, "ViewCount":"95", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-26T00:01:03.793", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.robbie.eugraph.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KD6Fx.jpg", "Id":"2500", "AccountId":"1119822", "CreationDate":"2013-09-24T01:14:12.593", "AboutMe":"<p>PhD Candidate in Ecology at Missouri Botanical Garden &amp; UM - St. Louis</p>\n", "Location":"St. Louis, MO", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"123", "DisplayName":"Oreotrephes", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-30T15:51:17.957"}}
