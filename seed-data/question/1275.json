{"Body":"<p>The Icelandic language is often used as an example of a <em>very</em> conservative language, compared to other Indo-European languages, in general, and to  other North-Germanic languages, in particular, all of which have changed a lot over the past few centuries.</p>\n\n<p>The retainment of its complex inflectional morphology since the Middle Ages is part of the evidence presented in support of its conservatism. It is often claimed that modern Icelandic speakers can even read the <a href=\"http://sagadb.org/\">Icelandic Sagas</a> (written about 800 years ago) with just a bit of extra effort.</p>\n\n<p>So, first of all, is Icelandic that conservative, as claimed? If so, what explains such phenomenon? </p>\n", "Id":"1275", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1276", "Title":"What explains the Icelandic language conservatism?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-13T19:03:09.263", "AnswerCount":"4", "Tags":"<language-change><sociolinguistics>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"22", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"656", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-11T21:31:13.553", "Score":"11", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
