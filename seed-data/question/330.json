{"Body":"<p>All languages display some form of the hierarchy of projections, to the extent we understand what this is: in a given clause, roughly, complementizers are higher than inflectional heads are higher than verbal heads, etc, modulo various kinds of syntactic movement. We can also talk about the ordering of determiners, numerals, and \"quality\" adjectives within the DP. Has anyone in the linguistics or philosophical literature written explicitly on why we see this pattern displayed again and again? Does it emerge from the nature of the syntax-to-conceptual system mapping (whatever that might be like), or is it (somehow) imposed by the language system? One can find detailed cartographic approaches like that in Peter Svenonius' <a href=\"http://ling.auf.net/lingBuzz/000001\">Spatial P in English</a> which are highly suggestive of the semantic nature of the hierarchy (perhaps suggesting it is not imposed by language?), but I can't find an extended consideration of its origins.</p>\n", "Id":"330", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"What is the origin of the \"hierarchy of projections\", the language system or (some) conceptual system?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T19:42:44.127", "OwnerUserId":"178", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><linguistic-universals><semantics><universal-grammar><philosophy-of-language>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-30T09:05:25.227", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
