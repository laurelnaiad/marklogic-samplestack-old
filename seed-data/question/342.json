{"Body":"<p>This question is related to <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/180/whats-the-difference-between-phonetics-and-phonology\">this other one</a>, about the difference between Phonetics and Phonology.</p>\n\n<p>I can understand the difference between the two subfields as well as what it means to produce phonetic and phonologic transcriptions. Simply stated, the phonetic transcription deals with the <em>surface</em> representation, whereas the phonemic one deals with the <em>underlying</em> representation. But how does one determine what is the underlying representation? For example, in English, [r] and [ɹ] are considered variants (or allophones) of the phoneme /r/. But what is so special about /r/? Why can't we say that these two sounds are variants of the phoneme /ɹ/, instead? Of course, this is just one example. It can be extrapolated to any pair of allophones, such as [p] versus [b] in Korean or [d] versus [ð] in Spanish, etc.</p>\n", "Id":"342", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"343", "Title":"How to determine which phoneme a group of allophones realizes?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T01:12:48.857", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><phonology>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-30T11:34:59.953", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
