{"Body":"<p>Syntactic theories in the generative tradition involve transformations, i.e. movement of constituents, between deep structure and surface structure. What is actually meant by this? Is it intended as a model of the linguistic mind, a metaphor, or something else?</p>\n\n<p>For example, take the statement \"English passive clauses are derived from underlying active clauses by a set of transformations\". I can think of two things this might mean:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It might be intended as an actual model of the linguistic mind. That is, the claim would be that when you form a passive clause, your brain first puts together the corresponding active clause, then applies the transformations to produce a passive clause out of it. </p></li>\n<li><p>It might not be intended as a model of the linguistic mind, but simply as a formal system, i.e. a set of algorithms that can produce linguistic forms that correspond to those that actual speakers produce, but without necessarily going through similar processes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If 1 is intended, what evidence is there that it's true? </p>\n\n<p>If 2 is intended, what is the point of such a set of algorithms, when what we really want is to understand the actual workings of the linguistic mind?</p>\n", "Id":"4750", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4775", "Title":"Ontological status of syntactic transformations", "CreationDate":"2013-10-19T02:09:04.003", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><philosophy-of-language><transformations><movement>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-19T11:49:58.270", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
