{"Body":"<p>For the 1981 film, \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Fire_%28film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quest For Fire</a>\", the late linguist, Anthony Burgess, constructed a language called Ulam (or at least that was the tribe's name).  Given that I'm helping a friend who's an anthropology professor with a project for the classroom â€” we want to understand the roots (conjectural or not) of pre-Indo-European language and overlay it with a plausible and constructed syntax.  Here are some words in Ulam from the Quest for Fire that I've collected:</p>\n\n<p>atra - the fire sees me<br>\natrom - I see the fire<br>\natrois - I am surrounded by many fires<br>\nbuuuunan - I love the moon<br>\nbuuuunu - the moon loves me<br>\naga - water<br>\natra hidoop - fire lives<br>\nbratt - brother<br>\ndjan vitrash - go quickly, action!<br>\nehyu - grief<br>\nkharrd - the heat/soul of a group<br>\nmuuv - breast<br>\nnya Ulam - property of the Ulam tribe<br>\noowa - alarm<br>\notim tir preng - a good hunt today<br>\nsmerdolor - pain<br>\ntaka taka taka - aggression<br>\ntir hor ro - horse<br>\ntir meg - mammoth<br>\nvir - men<br>\nvirku - women</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some of these words have Indo-European roots and some are simply made-up so can someone provide a better example or source material that we may use to research a proto-European language that might have existed 80,000 years ago?</p>\n", "Id":"1329", "LastEditorUserId":"706", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1333", "Title":"What did people really speak in Europe around the time and place of the setting of the movie 'the quest for fire\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-24T13:52:36.203", "OwnerUserId":"706", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<constructed-language>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-26T00:17:56.020", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "WebsiteUrl":"http://goldenoardesign.com/", "Id":"706", "AccountId":"347064", "CreationDate":"2012-01-24T13:52:36.203", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a developer of internet applications using PHP, javascript and jquery, and most any database I can read/write from.
