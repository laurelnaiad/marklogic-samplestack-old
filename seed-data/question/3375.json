You could do the expletive It test - \"It was rumored that the boys did so\".  But since it's <strong>were</strong>, would that affect it in any way?  It's being affected by the subject.  You can't say \"It were rumored to have done so.\"</p>\n", "Id":"3375", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3379", "Title":"Raising to subject or Subject control?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-13T05:25:28.973", "OwnerUserId":"1784", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-13T13:04:24.403", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
