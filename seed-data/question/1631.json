{"Body":"<p>As far as I can tell, the comparative method is the most accepted and widely used method in historical linguistics. Often used in conjunction with the internal reconstruction method, it has proved to be very successful ever since the 19th century. There are, of course, alternatives, such as the mass comparison method, defended by Merritt Ruehlen and others. But such methods are, to say the least, very controversial.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there any reasonable alternative in historical linguistics? By reasonable alternative, I mean a competing method capable of achieving the same results by different means. Or perhaps, capable of going further into the past to reconstruct larger language families?</p>\n", "Id":"1631", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"5", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2413", "Title":"Are there alternatives to the comparative method in historical linguistics?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-14T02:22:42.807", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><methodology>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-14T12:45:48.220", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
