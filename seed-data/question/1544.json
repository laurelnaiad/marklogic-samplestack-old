{"Body":"<p>Spanish is often described as putting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(linguistics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">focused</a> constituents at the end of the sentence, leading for instance to VOS word order in sentences with a focused subject.  (For instance, Maria Zubizarreta's 1998 book <em>Prosody, Focus, and Word Order</em> describes this as the standard way of focusing a subject — and the author's a native Spanish speaker, so I trust her intuition.)  </p>\n\n<p>So for instance, according to the descriptions I've read, the normal answer to a question like (1) would be (3), and (2) in that context would be infelicitous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>¿Quien compró el diario?</li>\n  <li>MARÍA compró el diario.  </li>\n  <li>Compró el diario MARÍA. </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Today I found out that a friend of mine from Peru has exactly the opposite intuitions.  For him, the normal way to answer a question like (1) would be (2), and (3) in that context would be infelicitous.</p>\n\n<p>So now I'm wondering about the broader geographical distribution of these two word orders.  In what parts of the (Spanish-speaking) world is (2) the default way of answering a question like (1)?  In what parts is (3) the default?</p>\n", "Id":"1544", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1596", "Title":"Focus-marking in different varieties of Spanish", "CreationDate":"2012-03-03T04:13:41.427", "OwnerUserId":"306", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><word-order><spanish><varieties>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-08T09:15:44.680", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"173", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-01T22:53:42.563", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"177", "WebsiteUrl":"http://comp.ling.utexas.edu/~dvelleman", "Id":"306", "AccountId":"936287", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T13:37:21.977", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a grad student in linguistics, interested in semantics, pragmatics and prosody and currently doing fieldwork on K'iche' (a very cool Mayan language spoken in Guatemala).  </p>\n\n<p>Off the clock, I'm also interested in figuring out <em>why the heck we teach this stuff</em> &mdash; or in other words, why do people care about linguistics who don't do it for a living, what their interests are, and what they want to learn or get out of our classes.
