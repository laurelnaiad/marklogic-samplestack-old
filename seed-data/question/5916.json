{"Body":"<p>I'm trying to compile a list of possible types of word origins as a preliminary work before trying to design a database of etymological relations between words (mainly for Turkish but the ultimate goal is broader).</p>\n\n<p>By types of word origins, I mean things like evolution (with sound shifts from older forms), compounding, derivation (with affixes, ablaut, reduplication, analogy etc.), borrowing, calque, phono-semantic matching, different kinds of semantic shifts etc. I'm equally interested in historical phonological changes and historical semantic changes.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any established classification of etymological relations between words? Can someone refer me to some previous studies on the field?</p>\n", "Id":"5916", "LastEditorUserId":"805", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Is there a formal classification of types of word origins?", "CreationDate":"2013-11-16T16:23:43.633", "OwnerUserId":"805", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-16T16:39:27.103", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"20", "Location":"Istanbul, Turkey", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"805", "AccountId":"538434", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"347", "CreationDate":"2012-02-29T19:39:29.067", "DisplayName":"cyco130", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T03:11:01.960", "AboutMe":"<p>Musician, amateur programmer and amateur linguist.
