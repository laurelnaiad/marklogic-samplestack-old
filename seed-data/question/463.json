{"Body":"<p>The comparative method is used to reconstruct unattested languages from the attested ones. By comparing different sounds for the same words in various sister languages, it is possible to infer some phonological rules. The internal reconstruction method, on the other hand, compares variant forms within a single language to discover how they evolved from a past regular form.</p>\n\n<p>Would it be possible to combine these methods to \"look forward\", so to speak? For example, comparing several dialects of a language with how they were fifty years ago and then extrapolate this data to predict how these dialects will change in the near future? Of course, some degree of uncertainty would have to be allowed.</p>\n", "Id":"463", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"484", "Title":"Is it possible to predict language changes?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T18:03:53.477", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><language-change><comparative-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-26T18:48:25.683", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
