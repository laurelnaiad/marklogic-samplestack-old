{"Body":"<p>If you ask an English speaker to spell a word, there are specific, widely-known names for all the letters to fill this need. The same appears to be true for all Phoenician-derived alphabets that I can think of, incl. Arabic, Hebrew, etc. (Although I don’t actually know whether they commonly use those names when spelling words since those names are longer than English’s — perhaps someone can enlighten me here?)</p>\n\n<p>I think we can disregard syllabaries because the names for the letters here are obvious. Similarly for other scripts in which each lexeme constitutes a syllable (such as Han). Nevertheless, feel free to include interesting tidbits about this if you have any.</p>\n\n<p>But what about other alphabetic/abjad scripts that are unrelated to Phoenician? What about the Brahmi scripts (Devanagari etc.)? Unfortunately I don’t know about many other scripts, but according to Unicode there must be loads. :) Can letter names for spelling be regarded as universal, or do some cultures really have no means of spelling out a word?</p>\n", "Id":"246", "LastEditorUserId":"50", "AcceptedAnswerId":"262", "Title":"Do all non-syllabic, non-logographic scripts have pronounceable names for their letters for spelling?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-17T10:02:10.577", "OwnerUserId":"50", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<alphabets><orthography>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-17T12:19:05.827", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"50", "AccountId":"15632", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"411", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:11:04.557", "DisplayName":"Timwi", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-07T19:26:30.213"}, "ViewCount":"222", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-18T10:46:51.087", "Score":"11", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"50", "AccountId":"15632", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"411", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:11:04.557", "DisplayName":"Timwi", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-07T19:26:30.213"}}
