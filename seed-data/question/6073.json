{"OwnerDisplayName":"user58319", "Body":"<p>Romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese) tend to say that \"My friends came with their wife, who were all blowing their nose.\" (no polygamy, a cold epidemic but no monstrosity either), whereas Germanic langagues tend to say that \"My friends came with their wives, who were all blowing their noses.\" (!) Any explanation for the difference? Which is more represented in the Indo-European family of languages? Which would be the original way of seeing things and which a contamination by another family of languages?\n\"Mes amis sont venus avec leur femme, qui toutes faisaient trompeter leur nez.\" ('blowing their noses' would be 'qui toutes se mouchaient' without any mention of the nose; that is why I chose 'qui toutes faisaient trompeter leur nez' which is not common at all but has the merit of including the word nose, in the singular, of course)\nI know I would write 'avec leur femme' even though following it with a verb in the plural does look strange, less so, however, if you add 'toutes', the way I did in the edited version.</p>\n", "Id":"6073", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"My otherwise monogamous friends came to the party with their wives", "CreationDate":"2013-12-05T18:45:46.917", "OwnerUserId":"2825", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><latin><germanic-languages><agreement>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-06T02:47:22.363", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"143", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-05T03:22:25.263", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Montreux-Vevey region, Switzerland", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2825", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/21af814626e668b67186c5ecde392495?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3648090", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"111", "CreationDate":"2013-12-05T19:16:40.777", "DisplayName":"user58319", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T10:33:34.547", "AboutMe":"<p>I have been teaching English at lower and upper secondary level in state schools in Switzerland for about thirty years.
