{"OwnerDisplayName":"John Gietzen", "Body":"<p>First of all, I am not a linguist, but I was thinking the other night that being literate was almost the same as being bilingual.</p>\n\n<p>My reasoning is that sign language is distinct from written and spoken English, and sign language is a \"visual\" language in the same way that written English is.  Also, homonyms and homophones would be entirely analagous, if these are considered different langauges.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the only reason they could be considered the same language, is that they follow each other so closely. That is, there are many one-to-one literal translations between them.</p>\n\n<p>This distinction is relevant in natural language processing contexts, because it would mean that \"understanding\" a language and \"translating\" between languages would be distinct problems.  I believe that this could reduce the problem space substantially.</p>\n\n<p>Surely, I am not the first person to think this, but as I have no formal training on the subject; I'm not sure what the real story is.\nSo, <strong>Are written and spoken languages considered distinct?
