{"Body":"<p>I was always taught that a word contains as much syllables as it has vowels. By definition,  a vowel is a sound that produces a syllable.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in English phonology, by definition, diphthong is two adjacent vowels which though produce one syllable. I did not hear about diphthongs until I read some literature about English phonology.  </p>\n\n<p>I am aware about long vowels (which produce one syllable) and vowel hiatus (two consecutive vowels) which produce two syllables. So what is the proof that English diphthongs are actually <strong><em>two vowels</em></strong> who produce <strong><em>one syllable</em></strong> as opposed to long vowels, hiatus or a vowel followed by a consonant? </p>\n", "Id":"4186", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Is there any proof that diphthongs exist?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-14T20:16:04.513", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><diphthongs>", "AnswerCount":"6", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-16T16:21:59.120", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"351", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-25T19:32:29.627", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"20", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
