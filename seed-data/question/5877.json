{"Body":"<p>I'm wondering if there are good software tools or libraries that can be used to evaluate how well a given token conforms to English phonological rules. </p>\n\n<p>Ideally open-source, freeware. In a perfect world, I'd have a simple function that takes a token as input and outputs a rating of how well the token conforms. I'm not at all concerned with meaning. So a token such as 'minoplatish' would rank much higher than 'cejewoadvjije'.</p>\n\n<p>I'm especially interested in very short tokens -- 5 letters or less.</p>\n", "Id":"5877", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Are there good, existing software tools to determine if a given token conforms to English phonological rules?", "CreationDate":"2013-11-10T16:43:33.980", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2233", "Tags":"<phonology><software>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"38", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-10T17:17:16.600", "Score":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/533379225/picture?type=large", "Id":"2233", "AccountId":"446253", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"103", "CreationDate":"2013-07-08T11:30:10.200", "DisplayName":"doublea", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-12T22:08:57.907", "Age":"37"}}
