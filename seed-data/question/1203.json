{"Body":"<p>How do I isolate each of the formants in my speech? I want an easy way to hear F1-F6 for learning/demonstration purposes. I believe Peter Ladefoged mentioned a way to isolate either F1 or F2 in \"A Course in Phonetics\". Possible solutions involve moving the tongue in different directions while listening to the pitch created by air moving through the mouth (air whistling?), flicking the throat, etc.</p>\n", "Id":"1203", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1205", "Title":"How to isolate formants", "CreationDate":"2011-12-27T02:12:48.947", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<phonetics>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"41", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"156", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-27T16:13:47.130", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"207", "Location":"Sacramento, CA", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"41", "AccountId":"218482", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"269", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:03:47.793", "DisplayName":"Nate Glenn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-08T17:24:08.140", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm studying computational linguistics at Brigham Young University.
