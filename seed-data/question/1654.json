{"Body":"<p>In the sentences below, the phrases in italic have the direct object \"him\" as a predicand, and would, I think, be analyzed as predicative (depictive?) adjunct, according to the terminology used in Huddleston&amp;Pullum's Cambridge Grammar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>1a)</strong> She found him <em>with his hands tied behind his back</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>1b)</strong> She found him <em>lying on the bed</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>1c)</strong> She found him <em>injured</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The use of the past-participle in the sentence below is clearly different, as it forms a syntactic constituent (noun phrase/object) with the preceding noun - \"suspects involved in the robbery\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2a)</strong>  She found the suspects <em>involved in the robbery</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although superficially similar to examples 1, this sentence obviously has a different syntactic structure.</p>\n\n<p>Now, my problem is that in many cases this difference is not clear to me.
