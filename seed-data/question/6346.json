{"Body":"<p>There was an article published with a diagram showing Lexical Difference: <a href=\"http://elms.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://elms.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It cites a Russian source \"K. Tyshchenko (1999), Metatheory of Linguistics.\" I can 't find the source. What I would really would like to know is how \"lexical difference\" is determined.</p>\n\n<p>Another source <a href=\"http://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng</a> says english is \"Lexical similarity: 60% with German, 27% with French, 24% with Russian.\"[1] However, how is this calculated?</p>\n\n<p>The reason I would like to know this is I am attempting to write a program using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to compare languages to English. There are a lot of considerations when comparing two different languages: similarity of words, frequency of use, structure of language, ... the list goes on. A lot of these metrics can be determined using widely available models; however, what I do not know, what metrics matter in regards to understanding what languages have similar cultural backgrounds? I am open to other research as well as opinions on what matters when comparing two languages.</p>\n\n<p>[1] \"Lexical similarity. The percentage of lexical similarity between two linguistic varieties is determined by comparing a set of standardized wordlists and counting those forms that show similarity in both form and meaning. Percentages higher than 85% usually indicate a speech variant that is likely a dialect of the language with which it is being compared. Unlike intelligibility, lexical similarity is bidirectional or reciprocal.\" ref <a href=\"http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-info#Dialects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-info#Dialects</a> </p>\n", "Id":"6346", "LastEditorUserId":"3001", "Title":"Help understanding “degree of overall vocabulary divergence”", "CreationDate":"2014-01-08T15:41:09.623", "OwnerUserId":"3001", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<nlp><lexical-semantics><lexicon><vocabulary>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-08T15:48:33.263", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6a167af632fea802707ce70fffebd1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"3001", "AccountId":"80140", "CreationDate":"2014-01-08T15:39:48.773", "AboutMe":"<p>I am just filling this form out because I want a new badge, if you want to know something, ask!</p>\n", "Age":"39", "Location":"Chicago, IL", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"111", "DisplayName":"brianray", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-12T04:13:29.407"}, "ViewCount":"56", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-08T18:15:00.783", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd6a167af632fea802707ce70fffebd1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"3001", "AccountId":"80140", "CreationDate":"2014-01-08T15:39:48.773", "AboutMe":"<p>I am just filling this form out because I want a new badge, if you want to know something, ask!</p>\n", "Age":"39", "Location":"Chicago, IL", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"111", "DisplayName":"brianray", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-12T04:13:29.407"}}
