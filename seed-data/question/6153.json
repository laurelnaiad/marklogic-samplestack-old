{"Body":"<p>I am reading about binding theory and I have a little problem. The book (1) says that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A binds B iff:\n\n(i)  A c-commands B;\n(ii) A and B are co-indexed.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and c-commanding is defined as the following:</p>\n\n<p>Node A c-commands node B if and only if:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(i)   A does not dominate B,\n(ii)  B does not dominate A, and\n(iii) The first branching node that dominates A also dominates B.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So far so good. But then there are a few examples. One of them is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Poirot's brother invited himself. \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, according to the author, \"brother\" is c-commanding \"himself\" and they are obviously co-indexed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gRbhz.jpg\" alt=\"Tree diagram of the sentence\"></p>\n\n<p>But as far as the definition goes, the first branching node for \"brother\" here is NP and it clearly doesn't dominate \"himself\". So how can the c-commanding be valid here?</p>\n\n<p>(1) Haegeman, 1994.
