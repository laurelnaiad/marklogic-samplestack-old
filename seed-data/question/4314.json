{"Body":"<p>Going on the general assumption that ASL is loosely rooted in English (only in the sense that it was developed in a country dominated by native English speakers, this is not to say that ASL is derived from English), it most likely does not have a case system. If this is the case, based on my (admittedly shallow) knowledge of morphology and syntax it should have some semblance of a fixed word order, though not necessarily the SVO of English. </p>\n\n<p>Is word order, as in sequence of signs, strictly rigid in ASL, or is there a bit more freedom in sentence structure? </p>\n", "Id":"4314", "LastEditorUserId":"1165", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4316", "Title":"Is there a significance to word order in ASL?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-29T19:16:55.443", "OwnerUserId":"1165", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><word-order><asl>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-31T00:21:50.103", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"61", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"1165", "AccountId":"159641", "CreationDate":"2012-07-05T18:50:24.580", "AboutMe":"<p>Literature -> Computer Science -> Chemistry -> Linguistics student.
