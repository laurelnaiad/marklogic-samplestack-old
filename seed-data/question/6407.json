{"Body":"<p>I'm currently trying to build a sentiment engine to analyze student reflections for a university. At the moment I'm using the NLTK library in Python but I'm training the model using movie reviews. This is not the best ontology to use since it doesn't relate directly to the language used in student reflections so I was wondering how to make an ontology/dictionary?</p>\n\n<p>Any other thoughts on the subject of sentiment analysis are welcome! </p>\n", "Id":"6407", "ClosedDate":"2014-01-16T08:59:51.080", "Title":"Computational Linguistics - sentiment analysis", "CreationDate":"2014-01-15T00:13:14.197", "OwnerUserId":"3030", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><sentiment-analysis>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"16", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T00:13:14.197", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd5d1a2500a5bd7dd944fab42ae7b8da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"3030", "AccountId":"2115410", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2014-01-15T00:10:17.107", "DisplayName":"alto125", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:50:04.590"}}
