{"Body":"<p>What are the steps invoked in producing a dictionary?</p>\n\n<p>I am primarily interested in understanding the role software plays in the production process.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously a corpus for the language is first produced and this corpus needs to find a reasonable balance between technical terms, fiction, slang etc. </p>\n\n<p>Then I'm guessing the size of the dictionary needs to be decided on and consequently the number of words it should contain. Then I'm presuming the most common words from the corpus make it into the dictionary and the rest are ignored. </p>\n\n<p>But what happens then? Suppose I need to make the entry in the dictionary for the word \"of\" and I have 20,000 entries for this word in the corpus. How do I proceed? How do I keep track of the senses covered?</p>\n", "Id":"4623", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4655", "Title":"How are dictionaries produced", "CreationDate":"2013-10-06T19:26:24.897", "OwnerUserId":"1835", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<corpora><dictionary><lexicography>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-07T07:41:58.747", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"66", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-08T10:20:42.977", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}}
