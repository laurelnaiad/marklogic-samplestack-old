{"Body":"<p>There are several families of languages where the same word can mean either a concept closely related to <em>time</em> or a concept closely related to <em>weather</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Romance root: French <em>temps</em>, Italian <em>tempo</em>, Spanish <em>tiempo</em>, …</li>\n<li>Slavic root: Bulgarian <em>време</em>, Croatian <em>vrijeme</em>, Romanian <em>vreme</em>, …</li>\n<li>Celtic root: Gaelic <em>aimsir</em>, Breton <em>amzer</em>, …</li>\n<li>Greek: <em>καιρός</em></li>\n<li>Hungarian (Turkic root): <em>idő</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are five (or six) sets of languages with no obvious etymological connection for this word. They do, however, have geographical connections, so with only this data I can't exclude cross-language contamination from some proto-Indo-European root.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a known single origin for the connection between weather and time?
