{"Body":"<p>Hebrew verbs are based on roots. A root can provide different verbs through processes of derivation called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew_verb_conjugation\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>binyanim</em></a>. Each verb can be conjugated by in-fixing vowels. For instance (using the first person singular in the present), the verbs conjugate as such:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>לשתות <em>liśtot</em>, to drink -> שותה <em>śoteh</em>, I drink;</li>\n<li>לישונ <em>liśon</em>, to sleep -> ישן <em>yaśen</em>, I sleep;</li>\n<li>לצרוכ <em>liẓrok</em>, to need -> צריכ <em>ẓarik</em>, I need;</li>\n<li>לפגוע <em>lipagu'a</em>, to hurt -> פגוע <em>pagu'a</em>, I hurt.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In those various conjugations different vowels are in-fixed to conjugate the present, namely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>o-e</li>\n<li>a-e</li>\n<li>a-i</li>\n<li>0-0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What are the rules which dictate what vowels are inserted into the root in the conjugation process? In other words: is it possible to infer the full conjugation and pronunciation from the root or infinitive of each verb? Again reformulated: how does one know <em>liśon</em> conjugates to <em>yaśen</em> and not <em>yośen</em> or <em>yaśin</em>?</p>\n", "Id":"2282", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2553", "Title":"What are the rules to infer the vowel in-fix in Hebrew conjugation?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-21T12:04:00.217", "OwnerUserId":"682", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<hebrew><conjugation>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-15T12:52:01.840", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"304", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-15T12:52:01.840", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"11", "WebsiteUrl":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/717441/benjamin", "Id":"682", "AccountId":"369843", "CreationDate":"2012-01-17T21:01:13.080", "AboutMe":"<p>As a student in South Asian languages, culture and history, specialising in comparative cultures and cognitive science, I take special interest in the influence of cultural paradigms in the perception and interaction with the world in terms of development.\nI am also a polyglot with a strong passion for learning languages, including programming languages such as Python.
