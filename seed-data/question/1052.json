{"Body":"<p>Right now I'm looking for papers on how sexism is reflected in the English language. A lot of the literature is from the 1970's and is seen as a little out there and not empirical. Besides reading the abstract carefully, reading the actual study, and common sense, are there any general \"warning signs\" on what I should avoid in the literature?</p>\n\n<p>Also, are there any specific studies that are well known and should be avoided or are must reads? I'm focusing on semantic change and words used in relation to women.</p>\n", "Id":"1052", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1053", "Title":"Identifying studies on how English language reflects sexism", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T19:34:40.047", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<semantics><lexical-semantics><research>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"522", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"775", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-25T13:20:01.480", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"522", "AccountId":"1051949", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"16", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T19:33:23.447", "DisplayName":"user522", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-10T07:46:07.837"}}
