{"Body":"<p>I'm reading <strong><em><a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/18lsi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matrix decompositions and latent semantic indexing</a></em></strong> (Online edition Â©\n2009 Cambridge UP)</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to understand how you reduce the number of dimensions in a matrix. There's an example on page 13 which I'm trying to replicate using <a href=\"http://www.numpy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python's numpy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's call the original occurrence matrix \"a\" and the three <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition\" rel=\"nofollow\">SVD</a> (Singular Value Decomposition) decomposed matrices \"U\", \"S\" and \"V\".</p>\n\n<p>The trouble I'm having is that after I zero out the smaller singular values in \"S\", when I multiply together \"U\", \"S\" and \"V\" using numpy, the answer is not as it is given in the pdf. The bottom 3 rows are not all zeros. The funny thing is that when I just multiply \"S\" and \"V\" I get the right answer.</p>\n\n<p>This is sort of surprising but multiplying \"S\" and \"V\" is actually what Manning and Schutze's book Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing says you have to do. But this is not what the pdf says you have to do in page 10.</p>\n\n<p>So what's going on here?</p>\n", "Id":"6298", "ClosedDate":"2014-01-04T11:31:27.427", "LastEditorUserId":"2886", "Title":"In Latent Semantic Analysis, how do you recombine the decomposed matrices after truncating the singular values?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-02T20:33:32.977", "OwnerUserId":"2886", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><nlp><computer-science>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-03T10:51:02.297", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.marctanti.com", "Id":"2886", "AccountId":"329113", "CreationDate":"2013-12-16T20:55:41.887", "AboutMe":"<p>I tried not to be a geek and failed.</p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Malta", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"36", "DisplayName":"mtanti", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-04T12:42:38.277"}, "ViewCount":"58", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-03T10:51:02.297", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"17", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.marctanti.com", "Id":"2886", "AccountId":"329113", "CreationDate":"2013-12-16T20:55:41.887", "AboutMe":"<p>I tried not to be a geek and failed.</p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Malta", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"36", "DisplayName":"mtanti", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-04T12:42:38.277"}}
