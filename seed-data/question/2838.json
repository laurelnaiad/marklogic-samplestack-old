{"Body":"<p>Suppose we have two competitive synonyms <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We found out that during the historical changes of the language, <strong>A</strong> gains dominant position.\nWe found out the fact above via a statistical survey of language materials of different periods.</p>\n\n<p>We think the reason that <strong>A</strong> gains dominant position is that there is a high-frequency word <strong>A'</strong> which has a similar form with A.\n(And, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>A'</strong> are roughly identical in meaning. Strict speaking, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are a bit stronger than <strong>A'</strong>.)</p>\n\n<p>Which mechanism can be used to explain this? </p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking of analogical mechanism.</p>\n", "Id":"2838", "LastEditorUserId":"1442", "Title":"What mechanism of language can be used to explain competitive synonyms similar to high-frequency word?", "CreationDate":"2012-11-13T14:35:20.753", "OwnerUserId":"1442", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><frequency>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-15T01:22:32.100", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weakish.github.com", "Location":"China", "Id":"1442", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"78276", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"124", "CreationDate":"2012-10-25T12:37:29.153", "DisplayName":"weakish", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-04T15:51:08.803", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"http://about.me/weakish\" rel=\"nofollow\">about.me/weakish</a></p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"81", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-15T01:22:32.100", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"11", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weakish.github.com", "Location":"China", "Id":"1442", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"78276", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"124", "CreationDate":"2012-10-25T12:37:29.153", "DisplayName":"weakish", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-04T15:51:08.803", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"http://about.me/weakish\" rel=\"nofollow\">about.me/weakish</a></p>\n"}}
