{"Body":"<p>I would like to compare the pronunciation of young non-native speakers/learners of English with that of native speakers of the same age. The target age is primary school and secondary school age, ca. 8-16. <strong>I am looking for recordings of English native speakers of that age reading a short passage or a number of sentences</strong> (preferably BrE, but other varieties of English are also appreciated).</p>\n\n<p>I assumed I would be able to find recordings of frequently used passages such as \"The Northwind and the Sun\", but wasn't successful. The <a href=\"http://accent.gmu.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speech Accent Archive</a> includes recordings of two primary school age children - but I would need at least 10 speakers.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://talkbank.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talkbank</a> collection has plenty of recordings of children whose native language is English. Unfortunately, all of the material seems to consist of conversations, probably because it was collected to study syntactic and morphological developments in First Language Acquisition, not phonological development and pronunciation.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone recommend other resources?</p>\n", "Id":"4795", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Recordings of native English speaking children/adolescents reading a text", "CreationDate":"2013-10-26T13:06:50.970", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><english><language-acquisition><resources><online-resources>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-26T15:41:51.783", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"48", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-26T15:41:51.783", "Score":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
