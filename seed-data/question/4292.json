{"Body":"<p>\"The city of Rome\" means not the city belonging to Rome, but the city that is Rome. Is there a term for this use of the possessive? Why do many languages use their possessive constructions for this non-possessive meaning? Is this usage restricted to specific families or geographical regions? Are there languages in which it's ungrammatical to do this? What are the restrictions on this construction (e.g. you obviously can't say \"the president of Obama\" to mean the president who is Obama)?</p>\n", "Id":"4292", "LastEditorUserId":"2411", "Title":"Possessive constructions signifying semantic equation: term? distribution? explanation?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:42:01.713", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-28T20:46:28.910", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"75", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-08T06:35:45.880", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
