Dialectal variants Dienusos, Deunusos, Dinnusos and others.</p>\n  \n  <p>By popular etymology often connected with <strong><em>Διός (the genitive of Ζεύς, Zeus)</em></strong>. The dio- forms are probably built by analogy from an original stem die-. The compound die-nus-os is analysed as from a verbal stem die- (from diemai \"to chase, to impel\"). The nus- element gave rise to a toponym Νύσα Nusa (Nysa), a mountain where the god was nursed by nymphs (the Nysiads, Nysa is also the name given to one of these nymphs). According to the testimony of Pherecydes of Syros (6th c. BC), nusa is a word for \"tree\". Janda (Die Musik nach dem Chaos, 2010) suggests an original meaning of \"impeller of the (world-)tree\" (the axis mundi), connecting the god with archaic cosmology. The close association or indeed identity of Dionysus with a tree (especially the fig tree) is well attested in the classical period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What kind of environment can explain the divergence between L \"d\" and \"j\" or Gk \"Δ\" and \"Ζ\", though they are all from PIE \"d\" ?</p>\n", "Id":"2526", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2677", "Title":"How does the initial consonant in \"Jupiter\" and \"Zeus\" come from the \"d\" in PIE \"*dyew-\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-05T15:38:16.650", "OwnerUserId":"1306", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sound-change><latin><greek><proto-indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-05T16:44:31.373", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"304", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-16T22:11:16.543", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"13", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1306", "AccountId":"1783961", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"515", "CreationDate":"2012-09-03T14:12:48.473", "DisplayName":"archenoo", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T14:31:46.963", "AboutMe":"<p>A linguistic amateur</p>\n", "Age":"25"}}
