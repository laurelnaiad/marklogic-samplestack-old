{"Body":"<p>The vast majority of alphabetic writing systems are part of the Phoenician lineage (e.g. Latin, Cyrillic and friends) or Brahmic (Devanagari and friends). Is there an active alphabetic system outside these two families. I found it surprising if there are only two families, while other types of writing system seem to have a lot more families. Is there any explanation to this?</p>\n", "Id":"864", "LastEditorUserId":"62", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"866", "Title":"Is there an active alphabetic writing system not based on the Phoenician or the Brahmic lineage?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-21T14:43:46.227", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<orthography><alphabets>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-05T20:36:31.930", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.tdhsmith.com", "Id":"62", "AccountId":"558608", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:40:09.490", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a graduate in mathematics currently pursuing linguistics; I am primarily interested in syntax, semantics, and language documentation, especially in regard to special registers and/or signed languages, but I enjoy just about anything language-related.
