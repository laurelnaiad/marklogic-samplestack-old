{"Body":"<p>My question is about the current situation in machine translation. \nI am aware about two main approaches to machine translation. One which is based in a strong way on linguistic theory and another which is mainly statistical. Is this distinction correct? Is it the case that statistical methods with rather little Linguistics are at present most powerful? What are the relative strengths of the two approaches and to what extent is it possible to merge them.</p>\n", "Id":"350", "LastEditorUserId":"199", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Machine translation - Rule-Based and Statistics-Based approaches ", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T09:39:29.953", "OwnerUserId":"199", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<nlp><computational-linguistics><machine-translation><statistical-mt>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-27T16:52:24.793", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"9", "WebsiteUrl":"http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/", "Id":"199", "AccountId":"509527", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T20:17:18.580", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nI was involved between 1985-1993 in a machine translation company called \"TOVNA\".</p>\n", "Age":"59", "Location":"Jerusalem, Israel", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"17", "Reputation":"174", "DisplayName":"Gil Kalai", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-21T16:31:47.630"}, "ViewCount":"833", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-02T19:43:32.020", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"9", "WebsiteUrl":"http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/", "Id":"199", "AccountId":"509527", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T20:17:18.580", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nI was involved between 1985-1993 in a machine translation company called \"TOVNA\".</p>\n", "Age":"59", "Location":"Jerusalem, Israel", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"17", "Reputation":"174", "DisplayName":"Gil Kalai", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-21T16:31:47.630"}}
