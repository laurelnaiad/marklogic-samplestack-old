{"Body":"<p>It is said that European Portuguese has count/mass distinction as many Indo-European languages. However I noticed out that all products/items at stores in Portugal are labeled in singular form. In European Portuguese although countable nouns are used plural in a sentence like \"I bought apples\" as in English, they appear in the form of bare singular nominal on a price tag.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, it is possible  to see a price tag \"maçã/kg\" rather than \"maçãs/kg\" for the apples at the supermarkets in Portugal. I have seen plural tags for such items so far in all languages where there is count/mass distinction except European Portuguese. Why is there such use of bare nominals in European Portuguese which sounds incompatible with sentential meaning? </p>\n", "Id":"3454", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Is there count/mass distinction in European Portuguese as it is in English?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-28T23:04:46.437", "OwnerUserId":"1913", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><morphology><cross-linguistic><semantics>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-29T20:13:28.120", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
