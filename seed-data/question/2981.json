{"Body":"<p>I found a language of Celebes island in Indonesia, its name is Mongondow (mog). It has a Phillipine's Alignment morphosyntactic which it has combination of Accusative and Ergative languages. The word ordering is Verb-initial type (either VOS or VSO). The Phillipine's Alignment works like this:</p>\n\n<p>V+patient trigger _ ERG-Noun _ ABS-Noun (V_S_O);</p>\n\n<p>V+actor trigger _ OBL-Noun _ ABS-Noun (V_O_S);</p>\n\n<p>V+actor trigger _ ABS-Noun (V_S);</p>\n\n<p>V+patient trigger _ ABS-Noun (V_O).</p>\n\n<p>There are three noun cases in the language: Absolutive, Ergative, and Oblique. Nouns are marked for Absolutive and Oblique with separate word, while Ergative Nouns is unmarked. (Pronouns have Irregular Marking patterns).</p>\n\n<p>At first, I think the unmarked Nouns are Absolutive, because in other languages I found the Absolutives usually are unmarked. However in this language I found that the unmarked Nouns fit more as Ergatives while the Marked Nouns which at first I thought as Ergatives fit more as Absolutive. I am still hesitate, is it okay that Ergative case be unmarked?</p>\n", "Id":"2981", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Is it okay that Ergative case be unmarked?", "CreationDate":"2012-12-18T08:29:02.790", "OwnerUserId":"1592", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<cases><morphosyntax><ergativity><markedness><marking>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-15T21:29:10.953", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"125", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-15T21:29:10.953", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1592", "AccountId":"2157319", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"26", "CreationDate":"2012-12-18T08:29:02.790", "DisplayName":"Ray Yunanda", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-23T08:48:29.733"}}
