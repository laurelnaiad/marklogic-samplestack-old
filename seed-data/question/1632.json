{"Body":"<p>I was wondering if there is a published standard corpus of English sentences which are confounding for mechanical parsers. I am looking over sentences given here, and I have the following (very short) list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Jameson was generous; the hawk, greedy\" (verb ellipsis)</li>\n<li>\"Kindly speak to Sally\" vs. \"Speak kindly to Sally.\" (binding \"kindly\" to \"do\" vs. \"speak\")</li>\n<li>\"The man gave the cat, the dog, the cow, and the moose, the milk, the bone, the feed, and the hay, respectively\" (respectively/in-turn non-context-freeness)</li>\n<li>\"I am skipping to the school, which means that I am happy\" (the \"which\" unusually binds the whole action, not the school)</li>\n<li>\"John gave the man the book and the woman the pamphlet\" (\"and\" which takes two argument pairs on both sides)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there a canonical list of such examples, so I don't have to trawl around for these? I will be happy to accept either a reference, or a reasonable list of nice examples not repeating the issues. I already go through the New York Times or other newspapers, but they generally have complex sentences which only rarely illustrate these issues.</p>\n", "Id":"1632", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1633", "Title":"Is there a standard corpus against which to benchmark mechanical parsers?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-14T07:29:12.193", "OwnerUserId":"810", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><corpora><parsing>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-14T12:28:06.043", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"151", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-14T14:14:54.080", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"39", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"810", "AccountId":"528458", "CreationDate":"2012-03-03T03:39:07.707", "AboutMe":"<p>Everett is right. Chomsky was wrong. I want to know how recursion spread from Greece through the old world, and it seems we will find out. I am also curious about simpler examples of recursion, like list making.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly blindly follow Gell-Mann and agree with Joseph Greenberg about superfamilies and mass-comparison. I don't see any reason that the mass-comparison method cannot be made rigorous with good statistics.</p>\n\n<p>I like formal grammars, and I don't believe I understand something unless I can program a computer to understand it the same as me. My linguistic goal today is to write a good English parser. I think I can do at least marginally better than current parsers, which seem to be weighed down with theoretical cruft. Maybe it'll read a newspaper, maybe not. I hope to find out soon enough.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"New York City", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"92", "Reputation":"481", "DisplayName":"Ron Maimon", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-02T00:11:46.293"}}
