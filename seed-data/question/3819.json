{"Body":"<p>In Georgian and its related languages there is a concept of the \"preverb\", which is much like the separable and inseparable verb prefixes in German or in English phrasal verbs with a preposition or adverbial particle.</p>\n\n<p>Prefixes sometimes impart some meaning like a preposition, but mostly there is one set preverb per verb which is used in perfective forms.</p>\n\n<p>There is a set number of preverbs in Georgian: <code>ა–</code>, <code>გა–</code>, <code>და–</code>, <code>მი–</code>, <code>მო–</code>, <code>შე–</code>, <code>ჩა–</code>, and <code>წა–</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Preverbs can also be combined, the most common being: <code>ამო–</code>, <code>გადა–</code>, <code>გამო–</code>, and <code>ჩამო–</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But the materials I've been using do not go on to list the full number of possible combinations and permutations. <strong>So I'm wondering about rare preverbs, preverbs which might lead to ambiguity in analysing verbs, and whether what is possible and impossible in preverb combinations has been studied.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are preverbs with the same morpheme doubled possible, such as <code>აა-</code> or <code>მიმი-</code>?</li>\n<li>Is it possible for preverbs to comprise three morphemes?</li>\n<li>May <code>ა-</code> occur as the second morpheme in a preverb pair?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I've analysed some Georgian text and found words which might be examples of all three types but it's very possible they're not verbs or the following morpheme is causing ambiguity where it looks like part of a preverb. My Georgian knowledge is not yet sufficient to tell.</p>\n", "Id":"3819", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Constraints on Kartvelian preverbs", "CreationDate":"2013-06-06T10:01:22.267", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><verbs><georgian><preverbs>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-07T00:55:48.113", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"47", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-08T10:49:41.740", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
