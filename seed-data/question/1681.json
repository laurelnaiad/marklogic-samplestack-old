{"Body":"<p>In Portuguese, the third person accusative pronoun <em>se</em> (\"himself/herself/itself/themselves\") can be used for four different purposes: </p>\n\n<p>1.) Most straightforwardly, as a reflexive pronoun:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Mantém-se     forte\nKeeps-himself strong\n\"He keeps himself strong\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2.) As a reciprocal marker:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Amam-se\nLove-themselves\n\"They love each other\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3.) As a particle for subject indetermination:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Vive-se       bem  neste   país\nLives-oneself well in this country\n\"One lives well in this country\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4.) As a passivizing particle:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Vende-se     esta casa\nSells-itself this house\n\"This house is being sold\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How did this pronoun develop to fulfil such different functions? Also, is this unique to Portuguese or has it occurred in other languages as well?</p>\n", "Id":"1681", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1684", "Title":"How did the Portuguese pronoun \"se\" take on these other functions?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-22T14:03:27.320", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><pronoun><portuguese>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-23T02:32:21.200", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"167", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-24T01:19:33.903", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
