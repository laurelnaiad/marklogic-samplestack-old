{"Body":"<p>Are false friends less common between distantly related languages compared to closely related languages?</p>\n\n<p>If so, is it merely because there's fewer words that sound similar, or is it also that when they do sound similar, they're more likely to have the same meaning compared to similar sounding words in closely related languages?</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia's article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend#Shared_etymology\" rel=\"nofollow\">false friends</a> mentions shared etymology (i.e. true cognates) as a potential cause of false friends, and that's more of a risk with closely related languages compared to distantly related languages that have recently imported English loanwords.
