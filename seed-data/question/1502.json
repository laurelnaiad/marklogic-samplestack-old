{"Body":"<p>What different definitions of <em>phoneme</em> do you know?</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I'm not asking for an <em>explanation</em> of what phoneme is but rather for professional <em>definitions</em>. I'm interested in how the issue is tackled in different phonological theories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It sure is very interesting (no irony) to see how different authors explain why they're not going to refer to phoneme in their work. However, if you come across a definition (of the kind of definitions of terms that they have in mathematics), I will be still grateful if you cared to add it or refer to it here.</p>\n", "Id":"1502", "LastEditorUserId":"794", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1505", "Title":"Definition(s) of phoneme", "CreationDate":"2012-02-26T23:26:29.033", "OwnerUserId":"794", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><phonemes><terminology>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-28T21:33:15.157", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"1126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-29T21:04:25.907", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}}
