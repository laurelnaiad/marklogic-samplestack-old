{"Body":"<p>I'm working on some code for an open source package to analyze dialogic classroom transcripts.  I came across an interesting article that calculates a formality measure that I wanted to try out (<a href=\"http://cleamc11.vub.ac.be/papers/Contextuality-FOSprinted.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">LINK</a>) as it may help my field (literacy) understand what explicitness of teacher talk means.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>Heylighen, F., &amp; Dewaele, J.M. (2002). Variation in the contextuality of language: \n     An empirical measure. Context in Context, Special issue of Foundations of \n     Science, 7 (3), 293–340.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The formula for the statistic is fairly straight forward (p. 309):</p>\n\n<pre><code>F = (noun frequency + adjective freq.  +  preposition  freq.  +  article  freq.  –  pronoun freq. – verb freq. – adverb freq. – interjection freq. + 100)/2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There happens to be a part of speech tagegr in the program I use (R) that is over 95% accurate on tagging POS.  So I first run the POS tagger on the transcript and get counts for parts of speech in a matrix form.  The problem is that Heylighen &amp; Dewaele use a rather simple POS code as seen in the formula above where as the POS tagger I use, uses Penn Treebank coding (<a href=\"http://www.mozart-oz.org/mogul/doc/lager/brill-tagger/penn.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">LINK</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>   Tag  Description                             \n1  CC   Coordinating conjunction                \n2  CD   Cardinal number                         \n3  DT   Determiner                              \n4  EX   Existential there                       \n5  FW   Foreign word                            \n6  IN   Preposition or subordinating conjunction\n7  JJ   Adjective                               \n8  JJR  Adjective, comparative                  \n9  JJS  Adjective, superlative                  \n10 LS   List item marker                        \n11 MD   Modal                                   \n12 NN   Noun, singular or mass                  \n13 NNS  Noun, plural                            \n14 NNP  Proper noun, singular                   \n15 NNPS Proper noun, plural                     \n16 PDT  Predeterminer                           \n17 POS  Possessive ending                       \n18 PRP  Personal pronoun                        \n19 PRP$ Possessive pronoun                      \n20 RB   Adverb                                  \n21 RBR  Adverb, comparative                     \n22 RBS  Adverb, superlative                     \n23 RP   Particle                                \n24 SYM  Symbol                                  \n25 TO   to                                      \n26 UH   Interjection                            \n27 VB   Verb, base form                         \n28 VBD  Verb, past tense                        \n29 VBG  Verb, gerund or present participle      \n30 VBN  Verb, past participle                   \n31 VBP  Verb, non-3rd person singular present   \n32 VBZ  Verb, 3rd person singular present       \n33 WDT  Wh-determiner                           \n34 WP   Wh-pronoun                              \n35 WP$  Possessive wh-pronoun                   \n36 WRB  Wh-adverb  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That means I have to turn the Penn Treebank coding into Heylighen &amp; Dewaele coding.  Here is my attempt to do that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DF1 &lt;- data.frame( \n    noun = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"NN\", \"NNS\", \"NNP\", \"NNPS\", \n        \"POS\", \"JI\", \"JK\", \"CD\")]), \n    verb = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"MD\", \"VB\", \"VBD\", \"VBG\", \n        \"VBN\", \"VBP\", \"VBZ\", \"JI\", \"JK\")]),  \n    adverb = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"RB\", \"RBR\", \"RBS\", \"WRB\", \n        \"JI\", \"JK\")]),  \n    pronoun = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"PRP\", \"PRP.\", \"WDT\", \"WP\", \n        \"WP.\", \"JI\", \"JK\", \"EX\")]),  \n    prep = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"IN\", \"RP\", \"TO\", \"JI\", \"JK\")]),  \n    adj = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"CD\", \"DT\", \"JJ\", \"JJR\", \"JJS\", \n        \"JI\", \"JK\")]),  \n    interj = rowSums(X[, names(X) %in% c(\"UH\", \"JI\", \"JK\")]))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So you can see I combine the <strong>\"NN\", \"NNS\", \"NNP\", \"NNPS\", \"POS\", \"JI\", \"JK\", \"CD\"</strong> tags into <strong>nouns</strong>.  You may notice there's no articles in my code, it seems that Penn Treebook doesn't have an articles class but may classify them as other codes (I think maybe deterministic; this may be problematic in that is appears deterministic is a mix of adjectives and articles which are on opposites in Heylighen &amp; Dewaele's measure).  The problem is I run the code and I sometimes get negative numbers (according to Heylighen &amp; Dewaele this is not possible) .  This isn't because of the code or math but because I haven't classified the Penn Treebank into Heylighen &amp; Dewaele's codes correctly.  <strong><em>I am not a linguist</em></strong> and my attempts to understand this problem have proven to be well above my knowledge or research capabilities.  </p>\n\n<p>I am asking for help in correctly converting these codes or letting me know if what I'm attempting isn't feasible.</p>\n", "Id":"2249", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2251", "Title":"Turn Penn Treebank into simpler POS tags", "CreationDate":"2012-07-14T17:56:59.930", "OwnerUserId":"607", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<parts-of-speech>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-15T01:27:22.557", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
