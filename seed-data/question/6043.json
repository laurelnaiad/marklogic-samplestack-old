{"Body":"<p>Suppose an alien life comes to Earth, and challenges us to answer a question that will allow them do determine if we can communicate without ambiguities and solve controversies in a rational way. The question is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dear Humans:</p>\n  \n  <p>We know that 48÷2×(9+3) is 288, and we know that 48÷2y is 2 when y is (9+3).</p>\n  \n  <p>Given that, what is the result of expression 48÷2(9+3)? Is it 2 or 288?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They warn us that there is only one right answer, based on math and linguistics theorems, which is either 2, or 288. In other words, we cannot give answers such as \"ambiguity\", \"depends\", \"neither\", \"you are cheating\", \"2 or 288\", etc. We must pick 2 or 288, and give one of these numbers as the answer. If we answer correctly, they will proceed with friendly relations. Otherwise, they cannot forward us about the outcome of a wrong answer.</p>\n\n<p>They give us 10 hours to come with an answer. The government quickly assembles a committee with experts in both math and linguistics. If you were a member of such committee, which answer would you defend, and why? </p>\n", "Id":"6043", "ClosedDate":"2013-12-02T12:26:03.183", "LastEditorUserId":"2797", "Title":"How to solve 48÷2(9+3) from a linguistics perspective?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-01T06:46:21.317", "OwnerUserId":"2797", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><semantics><theoretical-linguistics><linguistic-universals><mathematical-language>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-05T06:52:33.883", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/588ae9e0b16e4428b6957ede51770eee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2797", "AccountId":"180621", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"113", "CreationDate":"2013-12-01T06:17:00.920", "DisplayName":"fernacolo", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T01:49:25.970"}, "ViewCount":"130", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-05T06:52:33.883", "Score":"-3", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/588ae9e0b16e4428b6957ede51770eee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2797", "AccountId":"180621", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"113", "CreationDate":"2013-12-01T06:17:00.920", "DisplayName":"fernacolo", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T01:49:25.970"}}
