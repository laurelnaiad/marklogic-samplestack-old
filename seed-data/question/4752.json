{"Body":"<p>Seeing <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/4747/what-might-s-a-v-o-and-a-s-v-o-mean\">What might &quot;S/A-V-O&quot; and &quot;A/S-V-O&quot; mean?</a> reminded me of something I've wondered at various points in the past. I'm familiar with the different clause constituent orders (SVO, SOV, etc.) and their relative frequencies. However all the information I've heard has been in accusative languages, or at least it described the orders as based on subject and object.</p>\n\n<p>Do ergative (or other non-accusative alignments) languages have constituent order that follows their alignment, or are they usually based on subject/object? What are the relative frequencies of constituent orders in these languages? Also, as far as I'm aware all ergative languages are actually split-ergative languages; is it the usual case that each type of clause will pattern its constituent order after its respective alignment, or is it more common for the language to have a single pattern of constituent order?</p>\n", "Id":"4752", "LastEditorUserId":"3020", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Constituent Order and Alignment", "CreationDate":"2013-10-19T06:03:38.557", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<linguistic-typology><word-order><ergativity><morphosyntactic-alignment>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-15T16:14:44.553", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc82Y.jpg?s=128&g=1", "Id":"3020", "AccountId":"2596734", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"167", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T16:08:59.447", "DisplayName":"Marjeta", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T20:16:21.790"}, "ViewCount":"61", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T16:14:44.553", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/JustinOlbrantz", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1097", "AccountId":"1561933", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"470", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.637", "DisplayName":"Justin Olbrantz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:48:30.797"}}
