{"Body":"<p>I am currently studying English language acquisition and an early elementary grade leveled subject's assessment results. The subject was asked to repeat a series of complex sentences. One of the sentences read:</p>\n\n<p><strong>My friend likes to eat ice cream when it's very hot out.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The subject responded:</p>\n\n<p><strong>My friend likes to eat ice cream when it's really hot outside.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm curious to know which type of morpholocical word formation would changing the word <strong>out</strong> to <strong>outside</strong> fall under? Derivational or compounding?</p>\n\n<p>Also, what about replacing the word <strong>very</strong> with <strong>really</strong> even though they both never change their grammatical category? Would this be a simple substitution?</p>\n\n<p>Any input would be appreciated. \nThanks</p>\n", "Id":"6052", "Title":"Curious to understanding a word formation", "CreationDate":"2013-12-01T20:06:10.097", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2802", "Tags":"<morphology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"60", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-01T20:38:01.077", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2802", "AccountId":"3667138", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"6", "CreationDate":"2013-12-01T20:06:10.097", "DisplayName":"Cynthia", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-05T02:39:09.303"}}
