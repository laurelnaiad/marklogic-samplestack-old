{"Body":"<p>I have discovered that making a <strong><em>communicative</em></strong> wishing constructions (like in 'have a good trip' or 'merry Christmas') in Russian, they use different structures depending on perfectiveness/imperfectiveness of an action. E.g. an object to wish takes different case forms, either Instrumental or Genitive, depending on perfectiveness or imperfectiveness of an action:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>Счастливого Рождества!</em> (Merry Xmas!) <em>Хорошего Нового Года!</em> ([have] a good NY!) <em>Удачной поездки! (покупки, обновки, etc.)</em> (= 'Have a nice journey/purchase/new clothes item, etc.) All the nouns are in Genitive (plus a mandatory adjective).</p></li>\n<li><p><em>С Рождеством!</em> (Merry Xmas!)<em>С Новым Годом!</em> ([have] a good NY!)<em>С возвращением (поездкой, покупкой, обновкой, etc.).</em> (= '[what a] nice journey/purchase/new clothes item, etc.)  All the nouns are in the Instrimentive case, no adjective (with the exception of 'New' in the 'New Year') are obligatory.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If we consider the event structures of the wishing phrases, we notice that the items from the Paragraph 2 describe future events, while the phrases from the Paragraph 1 describe, mostly, things yet-to-come. </p>\n\n<p>It can be concluded therefore that there is a kind of 'tacit knowledge' in Russian regarding perfectiveness/imperfectiveness of events, which is not communicated by verbs, but rather by cases. </p>\n\n<p>Is this the only example, or are there any other examples of 'tacit perfectiveness/imperfectiveness' of events which are not presented by verbs?</p>\n", "Id":"6404", "ClosedDate":"2014-01-16T09:00:22.413", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What are other 'tacit perfectiveness/imperfectiveness event markers' in Russian?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T21:14:54.407", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<grammar><cases><russian><event-structures>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-16T04:28:00.617", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
