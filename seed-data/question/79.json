{"Body":"<p>In this <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/67/is-the-seeming-relation-between-the-sound-n-and-negativity-purely-coincidental\">recent question</a>, I was trying to research a list of translation for \"no\", and a quick google found <a href=\"http://users.elite.net/runner/jennifers/no.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>. That website also has other similar pages, like translation of \"Hello\", \"Good morning\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, I am not sure about the reliability of those translations, and the website seems to target a tourist audience, not linguists. Where can I find a reliable and academic source? </p>\n\n<p>They can be helpful to find/identify cognates, etc.</p>\n", "Id":"79", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Where can I find a reliable academic source of translations of words to the world's languages?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T06:17:48.440", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<online-resources><translation><cognates><comparative-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-23T18:15:32.220", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}, "ViewCount":"212", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-24T19:43:33.930", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
