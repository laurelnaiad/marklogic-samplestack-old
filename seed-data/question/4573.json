{"Body":"<p>Most Indian languages are classified as syllable-timed. Some Dravidian languages, such as Tamil and Telugu, are mora-timed, which in recent research on speech rhythm has been called super-syllable-timed.</p>\n\n<p>Due to persistent and intensive language contact, Indian languages share many features. This prompted Emeneau <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/472464/The_influence_of_Dravidian_on_Indo-Aryan_phonetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> to describe these languages as belonging to a common linguistic area or <em>sprachbund</em>. For example, it has been <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/472464/The_influence_of_Dravidian_on_Indo-Aryan_phonetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">claimed</a> (see also references in the linked article) that Dravidian languages have influence the phonology and phonetics of Indo-Aryan languages. Retroflexion, for example, might have been introduced to Sanskrit from Dravidian.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Is syllable-timing in Indo-Aryan languages due to contact with Dravidian languages?</strong> If yes, please provide references.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/472464/The_influence_of_Dravidian_on_Indo-Aryan_phonetics\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> Emeneau, Murray B.
