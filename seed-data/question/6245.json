{"Body":"<p>I am working on a project where the aim is to create a dictionary of creativity terms. I am a scholar of social psychology and marketing, and the aim the project is to be able to track ideas and creativity in online forums.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore I was thinking if anyone in here would know what theoretical field I am looking for within linguistics. I have the idea that if fx people are angry, they tend to write certain terms or sets of terms. Also when people are happy they tend to write certain terms or sets of terms. In order for these things or terms to be generic, they should be independent of topic. That means if people are happy about fx their car or their dog, they would use the same terms to express their happiness across the two topics. Where I am getting at is that the mental state of happiness manifests itself as language by the terms we use. So will creativity. One could maybe imagine that when people are creative and solving problems, people would tend to use the sets of terms \"i think\" or \"maybe we could\"...</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone maybe recognize what is the field I am searching for within linguistics and what are the keywords and maybe also authors that have been writing about this stuff?</p>\n", "Id":"6245", "LastEditorUserId":"1578", "Title":"The manifestation of creativity in written language", "CreationDate":"2013-12-24T10:09:57.677", "OwnerUserId":"1578", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><psycholinguistics><written-language>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-02T19:20:19.973", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1578", "AccountId":"1762486", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"19", "CreationDate":"2012-12-12T16:54:55.747", "DisplayName":"Kasper Christensen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T10:29:47.820", "AboutMe":"<p>Am a Msc.Marketing student specializing within data mining and text mining.
