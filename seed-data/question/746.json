{"Body":"<p>Being in Albania I decided to sit down with a word frequency list of the language and look each up so I would know some of the common words I see around me.</p>\n\n<p>The second most common word in Albanian is \"të\", which Wiktionary describes as an \"adjectival article\". (A neat coincidence after my recent question asking what other kinds of articles exist). Here are Wiktionary's senses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>indefinite masculine and feminine singular adjectives in all cases but nominative</li>\n  <li>definite masculine singular adjectives in the genitive, dative and ablative cases</li>\n  <li>indefinite plural adjectives in all cases</li>\n  <li>definite plural adjectives in the genitive, dative and ablative cases</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what is an \"adjectival article\"? Where can I read more about them? What other languages have them?</p>\n\n<p>(Wikipedia doesn't have a separate grammar article for Albanian and doesn't have an article on adjectival articles)</p>\n", "Id":"746", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What is an \"adjectival article\"?
