{"Body":"<p>The word preposition. I am trying to break down a series of words into their constituent morphemes and am having trouble with the word 'preposition'.\nI can obviously see that the 'pre-' is a morpheme in itself. However for 'position' it seems to me that there are a few possibilities.\nWould it be pos + ition (my first instinct)?\nOr posit + ion?\nPosi + tion?\nPos + it + ion?</p>\n\n<p>If your instinct tells you one over the others, please explain why? I know that -ition is a suffix, but have read somewhere else that it is made of the affixes -ite and -ion. Are -ite and -ion seperate <em>morphemes</em> also then? Or is '-ition' one morpheme? I know that 'pos-' is a morpheme therefore it's just a case of whether to seperate the '-ition'.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully someone knows the answer to my question and can explain it to me.\nMany thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I just wanted other peoples' take on it, as the answer I've come up with is pre + pos + ition but I'm pretty sure that's not right.</p>\n", "Id":"3608", "LastEditorUserId":"1997", "Title":"What are the constituent morphemes in 'preposition'?", "CreationDate":"2013-04-25T11:35:23.307", "OwnerUserId":"1997", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><etymology><grammar><vocabulary><nouns>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-27T11:23:49.920", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1997", "AccountId":"2684950", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"16", "CreationDate":"2013-04-25T11:35:23.307", "DisplayName":"CatLady12", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-27T11:21:36.020", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"404", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-27T11:23:49.920", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1997", "AccountId":"2684950", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"16", "CreationDate":"2013-04-25T11:35:23.307", "DisplayName":"CatLady12", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-27T11:21:36.020", "AboutMe":""}}
