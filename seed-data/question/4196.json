{"Body":"<p>What is the difference, if any, between \"ungrammatical\" and \"infelicitous\" as linguistic terms?   </p>\n\n<p>I haven't had much luck finding an answer to this question on the 'net.    We all know that a phrase or sentences is ungrammatical if it violates the morpho-syntactic rules of a given language.  So \"I play ball,\" is grammatical but \"*Me play ball,\" is ungrammatical in General Western English.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm betting that \"*Me play ball,\" could also be called \"infelicitous\" in General Western English.    </p>\n\n<p>So, in linguistic terminology, are the terms \"infelicitous\" and \"ungrammatical\" synonymous?   Or is the term \"infelicitous\" a more general term, encompassing the violation of more than just morpho-syntactic rules?</p>\n", "Id":"4196", "Title":"What is the difference, if any, between \"ungrammatical\" and \"infelicitous\" as linguistic terms?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-15T01:56:36.947", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"790", "Tags":"<terminology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"172", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-15T12:25:01.387", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
