{"Body":"<p>The course I'm taking is based on Radford's Analysing English Sentences (2009). I'm having a lot of trouble analysing sentences within the split VP framework. There are very few examples in the book (and on the Internet). I'm not sure I'm doing right. I decided to start with very basic sentences. How would you analyse the following sentences?</p>\n\n<p><sup>Links bring to images.</sup></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cLyF5.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>He arrived</em></a> (unaccusative)<br>\nIt should be <em>\"He arrived home\"</em>  but I don't really know where to put \"home\" in this tree.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/TjehE.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>She works hard.</em></a> (unergative)</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AKEob.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The ship sank.</em></a> (ergative)</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3mned.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>They sank the ship.</em></a> (ergative)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The definition of \"ergative\" verbs in my book reads: \nThis term originally applied to languages like Basque in which the complement of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb are assigned the same morphological case. However, by extension, it has come to be used to denote verbs like \"break\" which occur in structures like \"Someone broke the window\" and in structures like \"The window broke\", where \"the window\" seems to play the same semantic/thematic role in both types of sentences, in spite of being the complement of \"broke\" in one sentence and the subject of \"broke\" in the other.</p>\n", "Id":"2922", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "Title":"Syntax trees for unaccusatives, unergatives and ergatives verbs (MP) within the split VP framework", "CreationDate":"2012-12-02T14:12:34.297", "OwnerUserId":"1542", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax-trees>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-02T19:50:55.243", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
