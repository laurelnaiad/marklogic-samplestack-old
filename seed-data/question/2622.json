{"Body":"<p>I've seen many cases when people who speak different languages make a common mistake spelling words. They <strong>add an extra sound</strong> (usually, a consonant) while there is no historic or linguistic evidence this sound is necessary nor it was there in the past.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thai: โรตี <code>[roː tiː]</code> (a kind of puff pastry) spelled as โรต<b>รี</b> [roː t<b>r</b>iː]<br>\n  Ukrainian: прецедент <code>[prɛ t͡sɛ dɛnt]</code> (precedent) spelled as пре<b>н</b>це<b>н</b>дент [prɛ<b>n</b> t͡sɛ<b>n</b> dɛnt]<br>\n  English: \"drawing\" spelled as it was \"draw<b>r</b>ing\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thai case is especially interesting since an opposite pattern is very common: consonants are often <strong>skipped</strong> from the consonant clusters: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>กลัว [k<b>l</b>uːə] (to be afraid) spelled as กัว <code>[kuːə]</code><br>\n  ใคร [kʰ<b>r</b>ɑi] (who) spelled as ใค <code>[kʰɑi]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suppose it might be somehow related to how people produce sounds generally, but I'm not sure what to start with.</p>\n\n<p>Since the mistake is very common, does it have any common origin?<br>\nIs there any research on this topic?</p>\n", "Id":"2622", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2630", "Title":"Intrusive misspelling - does it have any origin?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-25T16:02:10.210", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-25T17:29:14.407", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "ViewCount":"118", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-27T16:33:10.287", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
