{"Body":"<p>What is the difference between phrase prosody and sentence prosody?  </p>\n\n<p>I know that prosody is a phonological suprasegmental--its components, such as intonation, are more than one phoneme long.  I know that possible components of prosody in a given language such as pitch, intonation contour, stress, and tempo can be modulated to convey lexical, syntactic, and pragmatic information.  In English, for example, rising intonation is a prosodic cue that marks a lot of questions.   I know that prosody can vary quite a bit across languages.  For example, some languages don't have word stress, a fact mentioned in this paper:  <a href=\"http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/pdf/lucl/lwpl/1.1/roosman.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/pdf/lucl/lwpl/1.1/roosman.pdf</a> </p>\n\n<p>Note this definition of prosody:  <a href=\"http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Prosody\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Prosody</a></p>\n\n<p>I've run across a reference to distinct phrase and sentence prosody in this conlang, <a href=\"http://yiklamu.ludiware.com/grammar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://yiklamu.ludiware.com/grammar.html</a></p>\n\n<p>But I can find darned little introductory information on natural language prosody on the Internet, let alone any typological information about it.      </p>\n\n<p>Do any natural languages distinguish phrase and sentence prosody?   Do most natural languages do so?  Does this distinction occur in English?   If so, what are some English examples?  Also, where can I find more information about prosody on the Internet or in a still-available book?</p>\n", "Id":"4489", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4490", "Title":"What is the difference between phrase prosody and sentence prosody?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-15T23:07:23.430", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><phonology><prosody>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-16T13:26:44.840", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"92", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-16T15:52:59.233", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
