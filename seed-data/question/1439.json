{"Body":"<p>Sometimes when I see an example sentence in a linguistics textbook which is supposed to be incorrect or unparseable, I get annoyed because the sentence seems just fine to me. Garden paths aren't the same to me anymore, either, because after studying them I can parse new ones without much problem. For example, most linguists know the famous 'the horse ran past the barn fell'; because of that, 'the boat floated sank' and 'the car turned went straight' are easier to parse. How do linguists maintain a sense of what non-linguists can and can't do? There are always surveys, of course, but a linguist can't just write every sentence on a survey and ask for opinions on every one.</p>\n\n<p>2 more examples. It has been claimed that starting a sentence with multiple 'that' is not possible; but I am just fine with saying </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That that she did that was a bad idea was not a good thing to hear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps not the best wording, but I would give it a '?', not a '*'. Triple embeddings are fine sometimes, too, if there's an adverb. For example, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The computer the guy your mom saw yesterday bought broke</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is fine with me. Am I abnormal, or am I just a linguist?:)</p>\n", "Id":"1439", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1441", "Title":"How do linguists deal with losing normal intuition?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-16T19:26:58.810", "OwnerUserId":"41", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-16T20:38:14.707", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
