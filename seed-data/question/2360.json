{"Body":"<p>I would like to know if there is a system for classifying the <em>types</em> of questions that can be asked in languages. In other words, how are sentences that query the why, where, what, who, when, and how classified? I guess <em>whence</em>, <em>whither</em>, etc. also belong in that list.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, what is the term for questions that <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/13662/how-should-i-phrase-a-question-that-must-be-answered-with-an-ordinal-number-e-g\">query \"ordinality\"</a>? For example,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q: [What number] president was George Washington?</p>\n  \n  <p>A: The first.</p>\n  \n  <p>Q: [What number] son of your father are you?</p>\n  \n  <p>A: The second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AFAIK, there is no construct to ask such a question in English. But there is in languages belonging to other families.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any references on the distribution of these question types across languages?</p>\n", "Id":"2360", "LastEditorUserId":"1229", "Title":"Types of questions and questioning \"ordinality\"", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T19:27:44.773", "OwnerUserId":"1229", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<grammar>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-09T17:54:52.623", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"17", "WebsiteUrl":"http://127.0.0.1", "Id":"1229", "AccountId":"229112", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T18:34:04.980", "AboutMe":"<p>ɑkh ɑhɪm ɑkte wiz bɑɹsu:m</p>\n", "Age":"84", "Location":"bɑɹsu:m", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"121", "DisplayName":"coleopterist", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-09T02:59:59.327"}, "ViewCount":"142", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-09T17:54:52.623", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"17", "WebsiteUrl":"http://127.0.0.1", "Id":"1229", "AccountId":"229112", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T18:34:04.980", "AboutMe":"<p>ɑkh ɑhɪm ɑkte wiz bɑɹsu:m</p>\n", "Age":"84", "Location":"bɑɹsu:m", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"121", "DisplayName":"coleopterist", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-09T02:59:59.327"}}
