{"Body":"<p>Most non-European languages exhibit a clusivity (exclusive/inclusive) distinction. What are the common ways of developing new clusive forms and which clusivity is tied more tightly to the first person singular? </p>\n\n<p>In Washo (an Amerindian language), the inclusive dual -Å¡i and plural -hu are the marked forms, marked by a suffix: this suffix is the same as the non-first-person-restricted dual and plural suffixes for independent pronouns. The exclusive is not marked at all.</p>\n\n<p>In Miskito, however, the first person inclusive is formed from first person \"yang\" and the plural marker \"nani\" to form \"yang nani\", while the first person exclusive is marked: \"yawan\" (no singular counterpart) without an explicit plural marker.</p>\n\n<p>So one marks the inclusive, the other the exclusive.</p>\n", "Id":"729", "LastEditorUserId":"3020", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"How do clusive terms arise?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T19:13:24.617", "OwnerUserId":"341", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><etymology><grammatical-number><washo>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-15T15:39:49.787", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc82Y.jpg?s=128&g=1", "Id":"3020", "AccountId":"2596734", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"167", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T16:08:59.447", "DisplayName":"Marjeta", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T20:16:21.790"}, "ViewCount":"181", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T15:39:49.787", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://thetahoetongue.blogspot.com/", "Location":"San Francisco", "Id":"341", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"927042", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"79", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T18:29:26.687", "DisplayName":"Anthony Miles", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-06T19:25:27.660", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm the same guy who asked the question about Miskito.</p>\n"}}
