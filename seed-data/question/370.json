{"Body":"<p>When field linguists begin to study a new language with whose speakers they don't share a common language, how do they begin?</p>\n\n<p>I don't need the whole story, just the very start, the \"bootstrapping\". For some remote languages even the nearest dominating language might be a rare exotic language for us. For example Australian languages. It's likely the native speakers won't be fluent in English but maybe Kriol instead. Would the linguist have to master that instead. The same must apply for the Caucasus, Northern Pakistan, or the Amazon jungle.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard this is actually done and I'm not just imagining it. Is there a standard way to start studying a completely alien language?</p>\n", "Id":"370", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"How do field linguists begin to study an undocumented language which they cannot speak?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T20:11:22.487", "AnswerCount":"4", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"51", "Tags":"<field-linguistics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"620", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-22T23:15:05.573", "Score":"16", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
