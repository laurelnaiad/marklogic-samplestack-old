{"Body":"<p>In what contexts can the zero copula occur in African-American Vernacular English? What rules govern its use—for example, what makes <code>she runnin'</code> more likely to be acceptable than <code>?she a runner</code>?\nSome of what I know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some (I think <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labov\">Labov</a>, notably) have proposed that copula absence in AAVE occurs where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAVE#Other_grammatical_characteristics\">SAE would allow contraction</a>, but there are counterexamples (<code>*\"How old you think his baby ’s\"</code>, <code>How old you think his baby is</code>, <code>how old you think his baby</code>), so this does not fully explain the context</li>\n<li>As with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_copula#In_other_languages\">copula absence in other languages like Russian</a>, AAVE zero copula depends on tense (copula absence usually occurs in present tense: <code>*she home yesterday</code>, <code>she home today</code>)</li>\n<li><p>I've read that copula absence is much more common if a VP follows than a NP (perhaps Labov, again); a <a href=\"http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/dsharma/JPCL09sr.pdf\">paper on AAVE origins</a> mentions this, that zero copula is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>most frequent with a gon(na) future or a progressive (<em>she Ø gon tell him</em>; <em>she Ø\n  walking</em>), least frequent before a noun phrase (<em>he Ø a man</em>)...<br>\n  The general pattern for AAVE is given in (1), with predicate types listed according to increasing rates of copula absence:<br>\n  (1) NP &lt; Loc &lt; Adj &lt; V-ing &lt; gonna</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>Copula absence may not occur for habitual actions because <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_be\">habitual be</a>, replacement of <em>is</em> with <em>be</em>, may occur. Habitual be is used for things that are ongoing or usual as opposed to a moment in the present (<code>Cookie Monster be eating cookies</code>, even if he isn't at this moment).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Are there other predictions we can make about when copula absence can occur in AAVE? Does any cross-linguistic approach to copula constructions provide clues?</p>\n", "Id":"143", "LastEditorUserId":"91", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"289", "Title":"When does copula absence occur in African-American Vernacular English?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T21:20:37.263", "OwnerUserId":"77", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><copula>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-15T12:07:22.903", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"132", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jsbangs.com", "Id":"91", "AccountId":"5121", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T01:49:40.413", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a degree in Linguistics, but I work as a programmer.
