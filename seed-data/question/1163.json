{"Body":"<p>I just finished reading The Atoms of Language. The gist is that languages have parameters, one of which will tell you which side of a phrase to add a new word.</p>\n\n<p>But in some languages, like <a href=\"http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1112b&amp;L=conlang&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13922\">French</a> and Spanish, adjectives sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they modify. And the meaning of the adjective varies according to that order. How can this be explained within the parameters theory?</p>\n", "Id":"1163", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1181", "Title":"How can adjective-noun order in French be explained by parameter theory?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-16T13:44:31.063", "OwnerUserId":"20", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><french><adjectives><branching><parameters>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-24T03:50:10.383", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"432", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-24T03:50:10.383", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"16", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"72", "WebsiteUrl":"http://suburbandestiny.com/conlang", "Id":"20", "AccountId":"15651", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:53:42.550", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programmer by day and an amateur linguist by night.</p>\n\n<p>I organize the Arlington Linguistics Book Club, where we read a wide variety of books that make the science of linguistic accessible to a popular audience.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"6", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"1657", "DisplayName":"MatthewMartin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:46:09.130"}}
