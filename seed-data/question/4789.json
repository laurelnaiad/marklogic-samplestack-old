{"Body":"<p>Having read this <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/538/are-there-grammatical-analyses-of-languages-that-are-extremely-different-from-ie/542#542\">SO answer</a>, I am curious if another supposedly non-configurational language like Wubuy (Nunggubuyu) has been re-analyzed as \"configurational\". Work on it was done by <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00133375\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeffrey Health</a>  in 1986, and still being used as example by <a href=\"http://easyurltoremember.com/docs/papers/nonconfigurationality.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Gulumbia</a> in 2004, which was after Legate's 2002 dissertation. I quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here even Warlpiri seems not to be the true limit case. Heath (1986) describes\n  Nunggubuyu, an Australian language of Arnhem Land that is ‘‘more radically\n  nonconﬁgurational than Warlpiri, particularly in lacking clear evidence for a subject-\n  VP split’’ (Heath, 1986, p. 376). The critical phenomena in question, in addition\n  to the discontinuous constituents, free word order, and extensive use of null anaphora\n  familiar from Warlpiri, include ‘‘extremely complex’’ morphology and\n  morphophonemics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would be interested in knowing any research work on that.
