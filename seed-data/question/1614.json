{"Body":"<p>In a language I am studying I have just noticed a significant but subtle difference in the length of [f] segments in tonic versus atonic syllables (an ~50ms difference which is statistically significant). When mentioning the effect to a colleague, I was asked whether such an effect, where consonants differ in their lengths (closure or constriction time) depending on their position in the word, is cross-linguistically common. I said that surely it must be, but I realized that I could only think of two examples, in English [s] (<a href=\"http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/1/51\">Klatt 1974</a>) and Ibibio nasals (<a href=\"http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~akinlabi/foot-structure-in-Ibibio-verb.pdf\">Akinlabi &amp; Urua 2002: 135, fn.11</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Can I have help with other examples?</p>\n", "Id":"1614", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1615", "Title":"Consonant length-differences by prominence", "CreationDate":"2012-03-11T01:48:47.480", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><linguistic-typology><consonants><accent>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-11T03:56:29.457", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"311", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-11T03:56:29.457", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
