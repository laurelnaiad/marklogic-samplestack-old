{"Body":"<p>Some pet owners seem to be able to speak to their cats or dogs. Is there any evidence that animals understand human languages?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: By <em>understand</em>, i mean understanding of spoken language and relatively long sentence. We are not talking about understanding of some reserved, isolated words (like run command or attack command for dogs). It's more like understanding of <em>discourse</em> with all methaphors and grammatical constructions and perhaps all this <em>Sprachspiel</em> (Wittgenstein).</p>\n", "Id":"4383", "LastEditorUserId":"2432", "Title":"There is evidence that domesticated animals (cats or dogs) understand human language?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-04T11:49:33.987", "OwnerUserId":"2432", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><language-acquisition>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-05T11:46:39.953", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2432", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20c42531e4791092713928b0a2086696?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3261153", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"18", "CreationDate":"2013-09-04T11:49:33.987", "DisplayName":"bokryonok", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-06T07:55:27.630", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm not a professional linguist.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"159", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-05T11:46:39.953", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"12", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2432", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20c42531e4791092713928b0a2086696?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3261153", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"18", "CreationDate":"2013-09-04T11:49:33.987", "DisplayName":"bokryonok", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-06T07:55:27.630", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm not a professional linguist.</p>\n"}}
