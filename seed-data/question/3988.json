{"Body":"<p>When I try to write a poem or some lyrics in English, I am stuck with the very strict word order and other things like articles, very repetitive usage of articles (a/an, the) that destroy the sound when you are using nouns. You cannot drop the (I, you, he/she) like in Slavic languages etc.</p>\n\n<p>When I write a poem in Czech or Slovak I like the plasticity of the words, I have much more possibilities when building rhymes, my words are free of the articles, word order I have the possibility to use the (untold) object/subject (because of the genders and grammatical cases), etc.</p>\n\n<p>In Slovak language there is the <strong>\"Rhythmic law\"</strong> or rhythmic alternation length is changed for a short syllables after the previous long syllable. This law is typical for Slovak and other Slavic languages ​​do not have it. </p>\n\n<p>E.g. omáčka (o-máč-ka/short-long-short) or vyúdený (vy-ú-de-ný/short-long-short-long).</p>\n\n<p>I haven't seen something like that in any other language. It's perfect for poetry. The rhytmic changes make it melodic and very pleasant for the ears.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing: I can pronounce every letter as it is(and with different modulation/tone), very hard to explain, but it's very powerful thing in poetry <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=B8u8Nd-n2XM\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=B8u8Nd-n2XM</a></p>\n\n<p>Here it's extremely obvious to notice short-long-short-long-short-long <a href=\"http://youtu.be/TCiZSxrWxTg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://youtu.be/TCiZSxrWxTg</a> it's characteristic for middle part of Slovakia</p>\n\n<p>Or more serious \"Mor ho!\" from Samo Chalupka <a href=\"http://youtu.be/5KCse2zSzII\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://youtu.be/5KCse2zSzII</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Example of free word order (Czech)\ne.g.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Jsem z města.</em><br>\n  <em>lit.</em> Am from city<br>\n  I am from the city</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>could by said in poetry (or in real life too) like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Z města jsem.</em><br>\n  <em>lit.</em> From city am<br>\n  From the city I am</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Já z města jsem</em><br>\n  <em>lit.</em> I, From city Am</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Já jsem z města</em><br>\n  <em>lit.</em> I am from city</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Z města já jsem</em><br>\n  <em>lit.</em> From city I Am</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and other combinations.</p>\n\n<p>Are Slavic languages because of their plasticity better for poetry? Is there some study about using the languages in poetry (which languages are what advantages/disadvantages?)</p>\n", "Id":"3988", "ClosedDate":"2013-08-15T10:00:16.177", "LastEditorUserId":"2182", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3994", "Title":"Are Slavic languages better suited for poetry?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-10T15:58:03.027", "OwnerUserId":"2182", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<romance-languages><slavic-languages><czech><poetry>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-14T21:08:30.560", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2182", "AccountId":"1344851", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-06-23T19:29:52.753", "DisplayName":"Derfder", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T20:11:11.777", "AboutMe":"<p>Derfder is my name ;)</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"222", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-14T21:08:30.560", "Score":"-3", "CommentCount":"22", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2182", "AccountId":"1344851", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-06-23T19:29:52.753", "DisplayName":"Derfder", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T20:11:11.777", "AboutMe":"<p>Derfder is my name ;)</p>\n"}}
