We\n  have multiple different ways of expressing posession, but I found a\n  particular one rather interesting: When I want to say \"I have a pen\",\n  I instead say \"My pen is\" (literally translated). Other ways to express posession are: \"There is a pen near me\", \"There is a pen with me\", or \"There is a pen in my custody\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Japanese seems to have a  similar (possibly not the same) construct to \"My pen is\" (<em>watashi-no pen-desu</em>) when it comes to possession. Russian uses something similar to \"X is near me\"  (<em>У меня есть X</em>)<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in English, we use the verb \"to have\" for possession and the object being possessed is the direct object of the verb. French and Spanish do something similar.</p>\n\n<p>How do different language families express possession?</p>\n\n<p><sup>1.
