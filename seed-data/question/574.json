{"Body":"<p>The Scandinavian languages have a suffix definite article which is pretty straightforwardly tacked on to to the ends of nouns: <code>-en</code>, <code>-et</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But in languages of the Balkan Sprachbund, Romanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian it is not so simple.</p>\n\n<p>For some genders in some languages, depending on other attributes of the noun form such as number, it may be a simple tacked on suffix like Romanian masculine singular <code>-ul</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But in most cases it's not simply tacked on at all but just one of several factors that contribute to deciding which inflectional ending to take, such as gender, number, and case.</p>\n\n<p>Typically the result might be that the indefinite vs definite form differ by having different final vowels such as Albanian <code>Tiranë</code> -> <code>Tirana</code>, but there can even be internal changes such as Albanian <code>Shkodër</code> -> <code>Shkodra</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in all these languages it's widespread and seemingly standard to still refer to all of these languages as having a definite article suffix rather than talk about \"definiteness\" as a noun property.
