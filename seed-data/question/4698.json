{"Body":"<p>Let's say you're teaching someone the sentence \"I got in the car\". This is a tricky sentence for beginners since they might ask: eh, what did you get in the car? Such sentences are easier to teach when there is a context associated with the sentence. That is, if you see someone getting into a car.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm wondering if any of you know of a tool or database which can be used to generate pictures or animations based on simple sentences. </p>\n\n<p>Google Images does not help when you enter \"I got in the car\" into its search engine. However, if you enter \"enter car\" you do get some useful matches. </p>\n\n<p>But perhaps someone has developed software that you know about which can generate animations and or images by inferring the meaning associated with the sentence.  </p>\n", "Id":"4698", "LastEditorUserId":"1835", "Title":"Associating Sentences with Animations", "CreationDate":"2013-10-10T21:00:50.137", "OwnerUserId":"1835", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sentences>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-11T04:57:34.173", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"43", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-11T04:57:34.173", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}}
