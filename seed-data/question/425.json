{"Body":"<p>Simultaneous bilingualism (or multilangualism) is when a child acquires two (or many) languages simultaneously, for example when they are raised by parents speaking more than one language. </p>\n\n<p>Sequential is when the child acquires the second language(s) after having considerably learnt the first language, for example when the parental tongue is different than the main language of the community or education system.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard that these two will result in different types of bilingual. How will they differ? Which one will become better speaker of the two languages, assuming both languages are acquired during the critical age?</p>\n", "Id":"425", "LastEditorUserId":"58", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"Simultaneous bilingualism vs Sequential bilingualism", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T17:06:07.957", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><bilingualism>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-26T14:28:26.870", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"43", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"58", "AccountId":"264197", "Views":"14", "Reputation":"458", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:34:17.763", "DisplayName":"Anschel Schaffer-Cohen", "LastAccessDate":"2011-11-03T19:12:24.783"}, "ViewCount":"2815", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-26T15:09:28.263", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
