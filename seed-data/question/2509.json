{"Body":"<p>When euphemisms enter another language, are the words making up the euphemism more likely to be translated to that language compared to non-euphemisms? I suspect that people translate words in the euphemisms to emphasize the euphemisms involved.</p>\n\n<p>From world war 2, the euphemistic term \"die Endlösung\" entered the English language as \"Final solution\", and 大東亜共栄圏 entered the English language as \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\", whereas blitzkrieg, luftwaffe, kamikaze, and kristallnacht are usually kept in the original German or Japanese. Is this a general trend? (Some of the terms kept in the original language are proper nouns, but presumably that'd also be true of of the terms that got translated into English.)</p>\n", "Id":"2509", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Are euphemisms more likely to be translated when imported into another language?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-02T09:45:06.277", "OwnerUserId":"421", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"72", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-02T09:45:06.277", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"21", "WebsiteUrl":"http://andrewjgrimm.wordpress.com/", "Id":"421", "AccountId":"17355", "CreationDate":"2011-10-14T12:12:21.327", "AboutMe":"<p>I work at the University of New South Wales, where I use Ruby to analyze biological data.</p>\n\n<p>In part of my spare time, I work on fun programming projects.
