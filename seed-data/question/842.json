{"Body":"<p>On German Language &amp; Usage we recently had a <a href=\"http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/2811/is-there-a-non-insulting-definition-of-the-word-schmuck\">question</a> about the English word <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck_%28pejorative%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">schmuck</a>,\nwhich is a false friend of the German word <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schmuck</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Out of curiosity I tried the <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Schmuck,%20schmuck&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">capitalized form vs the non capitalized</a> form in Google ngram.</p>\n\n<p>Being astonished by the high number of hits for the Capitalized form I retried this with the more innocent noun <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=house,%20House&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">house</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I do not understand the results. I think all the words a normally written in the non capitalized form, except when used in titles or at the beginning of the sentence.</p>\n\n<p>All this looks rather arbitrary to me and I have the impression that I would choose a case insensitive option if only I had a chance to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Is this just another shortcoming of Google ngram or is this a problem for other ngram viewers too, and I have to care to set some options explicitly?</p>\n", "Id":"842", "ClosedDate":"2011-10-18T17:56:38.360", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"What is the idea of ngram viewers working case-sensitive?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-18T13:35:49.330", "OwnerUserId":"408", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<online-resources><frequency><n-grams>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-24T11:49:37.630", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"137", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-24T11:49:37.630", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"17", "WebsiteUrl":"http://pauerschell.blogspot.com/", "Id":"408", "AccountId":"247535", "CreationDate":"2011-10-10T16:28:26.947", "AboutMe":"<p>Database developer for SQL-Server and ORACLE.
