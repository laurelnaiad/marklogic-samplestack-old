{"Body":"<p>There is a rule used almost subconsciously by almost all English speakers (and I'm sure it applies to many other languages too) which is that yes/no questions are asked ending with a rising tone, and others are ended with a falling tone.

Again, is there any obvious reason for this or did it just kind of randomly develop?</p>\n", "Id":"2992", "LastEditorUserId":"443", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2995", "Title":"Why are only yes/no questions asked with a rising tone?", "CreationDate":"2012-12-20T13:52:46.537", "OwnerUserId":"391", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><english><language-change><tone><interrogatives>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-09T19:45:11.380", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"434", "WebsiteUrl":"http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DQ0tWyAAAAAJ&hl=en", "Id":"443", "AccountId":"33739", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T03:42:22.710", "AboutMe":"<p>My name is Ivan Zakharyaschev, Иван Захарьящев, imz.</p>\n\n<p>Also, 632305222316434.</p>\n", "Age":"31", "Location":"Moscow, Russia", "DownVotes":"9", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"184", "DisplayName":"imz -- Ivan Zakharyaschev", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T15:10:02.970"}, "ViewCount":"391", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-09T19:45:11.380", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"13", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ffaddons.game-point.net/", "Id":"391", "AccountId":"59775", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T13:47:40.267", "AboutMe":"<p>Long-time coder, with some interest in French and Philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>I sometimes hang out in the <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-and-usage\">English Language &amp; Usage</a> chatroom.</p>\n\n<p>Check out my <a href=\"http://ffaddons.game-point.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firefox addons</a>! :-)</p>\n", "Age":"31", "Location":"United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"136", "DisplayName":"Jez", "LastAccessDate":"2013-01-10T10:06:39.893"}}
