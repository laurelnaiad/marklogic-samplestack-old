{"Body":"<p>Is there any synchronic difference between homonymy and polysemy?     </p>\n\n<p>As a literate English speaker, I can usually tell when words that are pronounced\nidentically have different etymologies thanks to our wretched but etymologically\ninformative spelling system.    I know that \"here\" and \"hear\" come from different\nroots, for example, just as I know that \"run\" as in \"I want to run away\" and \"run\" as \nin \"Dad runs the company now\" come from the same root.  </p>\n\n<p>But, as most of us know, children acquiring language don't have access to etymological information.    So, spelling aside, is there any synchronic difference between homonymy and polysemy?    </p>\n\n<p>One possible answer is that morphologically different words are synchronic homonyms rather than polysemous words.     Consider \"lie\" (repose horizontally) and \"lie\" (use language to deceive).    A naive person like me could argue that the two \"lies\" are synchronic homonyms and not one polysemous word because they inflect differently in past tense (lied, lay).   </p>\n\n<p>But couldn't critic counter that \"lie\" meaning \"present tense of lie.deceive\" and \"lie\" meaning \"present tense of lie.repose\" are still examples of polysemy?  </p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?  </p>\n", "Id":"3672", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3675", "Title":"Is there any synchronic difference between homonymy and polysemy?", "CreationDate":"2013-05-09T03:58:30.160", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><lexicon><homonymy><polysemy>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-20T02:54:03.077", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"527", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-20T02:54:03.077", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
