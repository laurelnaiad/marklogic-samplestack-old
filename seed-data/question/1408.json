{"Body":"<p>First of all, what does <em>\"null-subject\"</em> mean? Taken from the Wikipedia page for \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_subject_language\">Null-subject languages</a>\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[…] a <strong>null-subject language</strong> is a language whose grammar permits an independent clause to lack an explicit subject. Such a clause is then said to have a <strong>null subject</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, according to this, a <strong>non-null-subject</strong> language is a language that must have a subject. This can be expressed explicitly or through a pronoun and dummy or not<sup>1</sup> doesn't matter.</p>\n\n<p>Most Romance languages, for example when telling the weather (the sentence is <em>\"It rains\"</em>) work without an explicit subject (1-5), but French is a (notable) exception and it doesn't allow sentences without expressing the subject (6), although in colloquial/oral usage, such sentences are allowed (7, 8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Piove. (Italian)</li>\n  <li>Llueve. (Spanish)</li>\n  <li>Plou. (Catalan)</li>\n  <li>Chove. (Portuguese)</li>\n  <li>Plouǎ. (Romanian)</li>\n  <li><strong>Il</strong> pleut. (French)</li>\n  <li>(Je) m'en fiche. — <em>(I) don't care.</em></li>\n  <li>L'amour, (je) connais pas. — <em>Love? (I) don't know.</em></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p><sub>Examples 7,8 are taken from Grevisse, Le Bon Usage, §234d.</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not aware of other Romance languages having the same behavior. I chose to treat the most relevant ones, but if you're aware of them, feel free to share them in your answer. Although I must say I'm more interested in French, if those have some deep relation to the evolution of the French language, then they might acquire importance. </p>\n\n<p>I researched a bit before asking and I found an article titled <em>\"<a href=\"http://languagesoftheworld.info/syntax/on-null-subjects-and-related-phenomena.html\">On Null subjects and related phenomena</a>\"</em> by Asya Pereltsvaig, which treats about this phenomenon, comparing English and Italian. Apparently it is only slightly related to this question, but it does mention something that can be interesting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] <em>«Not only that, but historically, French <strong>used to be</strong> a well-behaved Romance language like Italian, Spanish, Romanian and Latin, allowing null-subjects (or missing subjects). What also becomes clear from the historical record is that <strong>French switched</strong> in all the relevant respects — at the same time!»</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This article is hinting (well, more than hinting) to the fact that French used to work like other Romance languages, such as Spanish and Italian, but at a certain point in time, <em>it changed</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If this is true, I can't prove it because I have nothing about the old phases of French evolution, so what I'm asking is: when and how did French switched and became a language that doesn't allow null-subject in independent clauses?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1: A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_pronoun\">dummy pronoun</a> is used when there isn't an actual subject but it's nevertheless syntactically required by a given language. The usual example is <em>\"it rains\"</em>: It's not that \"something\" rains, but English sentences can't stand without an expressed subject.</sup></p>\n", "Id":"1408", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1418", "Title":"When and how did French become a non-null-subject language?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-13T09:58:47.803", "OwnerUserId":"111", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><romance-languages><french>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-13T23:44:49.840", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
