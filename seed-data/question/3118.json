{"Body":"<p>I will be attempting to solve the problem of automatic language identification/detection (and later translation), and I'm in a need of free digital dictionaries or corpora.</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for dictionaries for English, German and Slovenian language. Each dictionary must have words translated to all other mentioned languages. I only need word--word/\"list of words\" kind of dictionary, I don't need the definitions, nor examples. Preferably, they should contain word frequencies/probabilities, or at least be sorted from most used to least.</p>\n\n<p>Since the above request seems a bit unreasonable, I'm completely fine with large corpora (50GB+ of plain text is preferred; but at least 10GB is fine too) for each language. Preferably noiseless, which means that the German language shouldn't contain (many) English words.</p>\n", "Id":"3118", "LastEditorUserId":"3020", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3122", "Title":"Looking for bi-/tri-lingual dictionaries or corpora", "CreationDate":"2013-01-25T17:53:27.153", "OwnerUserId":"1700", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><nlp><dictionary><german><slovenian>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-15T16:47:19.570", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc82Y.jpg?s=128&g=1", "Id":"3020", "AccountId":"2596734", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"167", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T16:08:59.447", "DisplayName":"Marjeta", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T20:16:21.790"}, "ViewCount":"91", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T16:47:19.570", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1700", "AccountId":"1320530", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"128", "CreationDate":"2013-01-25T17:36:12.870", "DisplayName":"Howie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-05T12:37:15.407"}}
