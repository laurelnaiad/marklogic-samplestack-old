{"Body":"<p>In all the languages I know, at least one of the following aspects is complex/difficult:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Alphabet</em>: Complex meaning a large alphabet like in Chinese.</li>\n<li><em>Pronunciation</em>: Complex meaning that, for example, small differences in pronunciation can lead to large differences in meaning as in Chinese, or that it is hard/impossible to infer a word's pronunciation from its spelling and vice versa as in English.</li>\n<li><em>Grammar</em> : Complex meaning, for example, redundant information like conjugation plus personal pronouns as in German, or a complex mapping between grammatical concepts (case, number, time, ...) and change in word forms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, many languages seem to be \"simple\" in at least one of these aspects: Romanian, for example, has a complex grammar but simple pronunciation. Chinese languages, on the other hand, are said to have simple grammar (due to what I think are called invariant lexemes) but complex pronunciation (due to the usage of <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tone_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">tone</a>). Hence it seems plausible that there are languages which are simple in all of these (and other) aspects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any \"simple\" evolved languages?</strong> And if not, why?</p>\n", "Id":"2169", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2171", "Title":"Are there any \"simple\" languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-06-23T18:33:41.080", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<evolution><pronunciation><grammar><alphabets>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"413", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"590", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-27T12:23:37.723", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"413", "AccountId":"457851", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"123", "CreationDate":"2011-10-11T22:57:16.160", "DisplayName":"Florian Brucker", "LastAccessDate":"2012-06-28T08:38:00.830"}}
