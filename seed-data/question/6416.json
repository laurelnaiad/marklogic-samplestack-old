{"Body":"<p>(I'm not a linguist, just a Stack Exchange user who thought this site is the one for this question)</p>\n\n<p>It is often the case that people living in rural areas (in any country) have a \"stronger\", less intelligble way of speaking. Why is this so? Perhaps because in smaller population it's easier for new words, new pronunciations to evolve?</p>\n\n<p>It occured to me that it might not be the case at all, but that it appears to be so because we take the \"urban way\" as standard, and in reality, all are equally strong/intelligble. But I think that there really is an objective difference. Is there and why?</p>\n", "Id":"6416", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"Strong accents and rural areas correlation", "CreationDate":"2014-01-15T17:14:03.850", "OwnerUserId":"3033", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sociolinguistics><dialects>", "AnswerCount":"6", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-15T18:34:33.830", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
