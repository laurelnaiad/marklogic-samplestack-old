{"Body":"<p>A friend of mine posted the following on his Facebook wall:</p>\n\n<p>I'm paraphrasing myself when I say this...</p>\n\n<p>I know this isn't a paradox, is it autological? Is it recursive? Is it even a true statement? If he had said \"I'm expressing myself when I say this...\", it's at least self-descriptive, but I'm not sure when it comes to \"paraphrasing\" because that seems to imply a shortening of the original statement. Can anyone shed some light on this? </p>\n", "Id":"2624", "Title":"Is \"I'm paraphrasing myself when I say this...\" autological?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-26T04:48:11.327", "OwnerUserId":"1352", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<semantics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"51", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-26T04:48:11.327", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cat5.com", "Id":"1352", "AccountId":"218411", "CreationDate":"2012-09-26T04:45:00.053", "AboutMe":"<p>Senior Software Engineer,\nCat5 Commerce\nSt. Louis, MO</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"St Louis, MO", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"104", "DisplayName":"Brad Urani", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-02T18:50:15.627"}}
