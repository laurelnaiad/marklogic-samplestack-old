{"Body":"<p>I was told years ago by a teacher at a Carden School that they teach their students that English homonyms, especially those with diphthongs, can be told apart by the pitch profile of the vowel sound. Now I see in wiki that all English diphthongs have a falling tone. This does not necessarily mean it won't work, but it makes it a little harder to achieve. I can listen to myself talk, but my bias interferes. Is there any scholarship on this?</p>\n\n<p>The example I remember is <em>\"meat\"</em> versus <em>\"meet\"</em>. It was said that <em>\"ea\"</em> has a flat profile while <em>\"ee\"</em> has a rising profile. This might be relative to each other. I also think that 'pitch' may have been a paraphrase and it actually means something else like emphasis or volume?</p>\n", "Id":"3130", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3132", "Title":"Are English homonyms distinguishable by pitch profile?", "CreationDate":"2013-01-28T10:28:54.970", "OwnerUserId":"1706", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><diphthongs><homonymy><homophony>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-29T02:25:21.870", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"167", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-30T17:23:30.047", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Los Angeles, CA", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1706", "AccountId":"1817420", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"128", "CreationDate":"2013-01-28T10:08:15.887", "DisplayName":"timquinn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-06T13:06:45.410"}}
