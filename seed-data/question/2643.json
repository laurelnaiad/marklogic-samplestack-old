{"Body":"<p>I am trying to get the topic of a sentence, i.e what a sentence is talking about (not the grammatical subject which may be different).</p>\n\n<p>So far I have got:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>OpenNLP in Java which is giving me sentence detection, POS tagging, parsing, tokenizer and Name Finder.</li>\n<li>MatlParser,stanford Parser - which can give the grammatical subject of a simple sentence by dependency parsing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think a noun or a noun phrase will always be the topic in a more general sense, but a sentence can have many nouns and noun phrases. </p>\n\n<p>A complex or compound sentence may have more than one subject which could be considered as the topic of sentence in that case I want to get any one of them. I am looking to get the answer upto some accuracy.</p>\n", "Id":"2643", "LastEditorUserId":"1376", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Locating a sentence's topic", "CreationDate":"2012-10-04T17:03:47.970", "OwnerUserId":"1376", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<nlp><linguistic-determinism>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-04T18:19:25.893", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1376", "AccountId":"1905711", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2012-10-04T15:59:35.663", "DisplayName":"Mahender Singh", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-12T20:50:27.003"}, "ViewCount":"225", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-29T12:47:48.333", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1376", "AccountId":"1905711", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2012-10-04T15:59:35.663", "DisplayName":"Mahender Singh", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-12T20:50:27.003"}}
