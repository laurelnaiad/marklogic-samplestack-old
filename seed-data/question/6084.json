{"Body":"<p>Bleeding is when rule A prevents rule B from applying. But counterbleeding is when two rules are ordered too late to bleed. I see counterbleeding the same as feeding. </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you have some segment X. Rule A and B may only apply to X. A applies first and changes X->Y. Next, B applies to Y but it is in vacuous application, so nothing happens. In this scenario A is said to bleed B.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's say we have rule A and B, but this time let's just say A applies to X or Y. Now, when we apply rule B first. Let's say B changes X->Y , and next A applies to Y. If A had applied first, then it would have bleeded B. This seems to be a feeding relationship. </p>\n\n<p>Am I missing anything?</p>\n", "Id":"6084", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6086", "Title":"What's the difference between counterbleeding, bleeding and feeding?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-07T09:04:54.610", "OwnerUserId":"2831", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><phonology>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-07T16:17:13.067", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-08T03:43:32.720", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"19", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2831", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2a13t.png", "AccountId":"3690291", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"85", "CreationDate":"2013-12-06T04:40:53.813", "DisplayName":"RECURSIVE FARTS", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T06:28:34.987", "AboutMe":"<p><code>Fart phrase = FP</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Fart = F</code> </p>\n\n<p><code>FP = F(FP)</code></p>\n"}}
