{"Body":"<p>The degree of literacy of a certain community of speakers is generally proposed as one of the factors that affect the pace of language change. More specifically, literacy would slow down change, since literate people &ndash; most of them speaking the standard variety &ndash; tend to conform their speech to the written form. Since spelling, by its nature, tends to remain quite stable over long periods of time, the language itself would remain stable as well.</p>\n\n<p>What is the basis for this claim? How do linguists measure the impact that the degree of literacy has on language change?</p>\n", "Id":"1254", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1273", "Title":"How powerful is literacy to slow down language change?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T19:31:41.320", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><sociolinguistics><literacy>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"22", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"257", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-13T12:50:00.527", "Score":"13", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
