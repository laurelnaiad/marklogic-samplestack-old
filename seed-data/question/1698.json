{"Body":"<p>I recently came across <em>oeuvre</em>, which in the two out of two times I've heard the word spoken (in an English context), sounded like it does in <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre\">Merriam-Webster's online audio pronunciation</a>, that is, with a vowel that does not occur in any other English word, loanword or otherwise. (As a side note, <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oeuvre#English\">various</a> <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oeuvre\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=oeuvre&amp;tbs=dfn:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R2FuT_nrEO7ksQKd_riOBg&amp;ved=0CCkQkQ4&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1016\">dictionaries</a> seem to list some very peculiar pronunciations, together with hilariously pronounced audio samples that do not match the transcriptions.) On the other hand, a quick check <a href=\"http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=opus%2Coeuvre&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\">here</a> suggests that the word has really been around in English long enough to have gotten more Anglicized. Are there any other English words with /œ/, or other non-English phonemes? What would have to happen to qualify /œ/ as an English phoneme? Is there a name for the use of phonemes that are not part of a language?</p>\n", "Id":"1698", "Title":"\"oeuvre\": foreign phonemes in a loanword", "CreationDate":"2012-03-25T00:27:28.737", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"370", "Tags":"<phonology><phonemes>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"166", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-25T09:55:42.430", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"12", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"370", "AccountId":"468828", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"318", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T23:43:14.110", "DisplayName":"JohnJamesSmith", "LastAccessDate":"2013-01-10T22:26:32.870"}}
