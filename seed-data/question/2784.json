{"Body":"<p>A current trend in cognitive science is to view the mind as a dynamical system (e.g., <em>Continuity of Mind</em> by psycholinguist Spivey, in which cognition--including language comprehension and production--is understood as a \"continuous and often recurrent trajectory through a state space\"). Although I'd like to critically evaluate this trend, I'm embarresed to admit that <em>I've never taken even a basic calculus course.</em></p>\n\n<p>Yet since I don't intend to build dynamical systems models myself, what is the bare minimum of maths learning that I need to accomplish in order to understand dynamical systems in the context of cognitive? Remember, I'm a total novice!</p>\n", "Id":"2784", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What kinds of maths to learn for understanding dynamical systems in cognitive linguistics?", "CreationDate":"2012-11-02T00:25:59.883", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1459", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><cognitive-linguistics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"134", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-09T15:13:02.497", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1459", "AccountId":"2002112", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"17", "CreationDate":"2012-11-02T00:00:18.177", "DisplayName":"Tyler Alterman", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-02T00:21:48.387"}}
