{"Body":"<p>A central distinction between dependency grammars (DGs) and phrase structure grammars (PSGs, also known as <em>constituency grammars</em>) is the understanding of the initial division of the clause. Traditionally, PSGs divide the clause into a subject NP and a predicate VP. The predicate VP corresponds to a finite VP constituent - there are also nonfinite VP constituents, of course. DGs reject this initial binary division, which means they reject the notion that finite VP exists as a constituent (but they acknowledge nonfinite VP constituents). Thus in order to evaluate the two competing approaches to syntactic structure, the empirical evidence that can be brought to bear on the (non)existence of a finite VP constituent is central.</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows: What theory-neutral evidence can be produced to either verify or refute the existence of a finite VP constituent? I already have a solid opinion about this matter. I am interested, however, in learning how others respond when exposed to the question.</p>\n", "Id":"6031", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Does finite VP exist as a constituent?", "CreationDate":"2013-11-28T20:24:22.430", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "Tags":"<syntax><theoretical-linguistics><verb-phrase>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"207", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-05T13:18:20.653", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"12", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2247", "AccountId":"3045491", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"565", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T16:52:54.170", "DisplayName":"Tim Osborne", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T04:26:20.267"}}
