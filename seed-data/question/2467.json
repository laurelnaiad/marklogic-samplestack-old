{"Body":"<p>Discussing recently abbreviations such as WTF, TFA, and OMG as being more commonly used in American English writing (or messaging) as forms of expression.  There seems to be some debate over if or when these abbreviations cease to convey their original meaning and become an expression in and of themselves — at least socially.  </p>\n\n<p>Specifically there seems to be one side assuming that the abbreviation of a profane phrase  is still profane and the other side not profane.  Certain abbreviations now so common I'm wondering if they truly aren't profane. I was curious if there is an official transition or definition when terms cease to be profane by abbreviation.  </p>\n\n<p>It appears to me that WTF and OMG no longer represent their original meanings rather have become forms of expressions themselves.  In generally they are far more socially acceptable than the original phrase spoken aloud and as such shouldn't be treated as a profanity.  </p>\n\n<p>I was hoping of some academic or official linguistic explanation of the transition.  </p>\n", "Id":"2467", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2468", "Title":"When do abbreviations of profanity like WTF and RTFA cease to be profane i.e. socially acceptable?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-26T23:06:56.313", "OwnerUserId":"1289", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-27T08:30:15.217", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
