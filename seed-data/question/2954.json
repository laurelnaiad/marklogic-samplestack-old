{"OwnerDisplayName":"demongolem", "Body":"<p>Sorry if my question is a little more mathematical in nature, but my question is:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I took a document of some length whether it be news article, book, or something of that sort.  What sort of relationship would I expect between the document's length and the number of unique words contained in it.</p>\n\n<p>There are two constraints a graph would contain: the line y = x meaning every word I read is unique and the line y = |english| where we recognize that English has a finite number of words, or some sort of upper bound although I don't want to get into a discussion on how many words are in the English language.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps more practically, how long a document on average would I need to retrieve to get a list of 100 unique English words, 1000 unique English words , or some other value?  This of course would differ between languages, but I am interested in English.</p>\n", "Id":"2954", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What is the Relationship Between Document Length and Unique Words", "CreationDate":"2012-12-10T21:08:22.500", "OwnerUserId":"97", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><corpora>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-11T13:37:36.023", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
