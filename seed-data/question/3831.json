{"Body":"<p>I am strictly interested in the question of homophones and kanji.  Korean has homophones yet they removed the Chinese characters and are getting by just fine?  Or are they?</p>\n\n<p>Japanese kanji lovers say kanji is required in order to deal with homophones.  Unlike English, Japanese has many homophones and you can't know from context which is being used.  As such we need to use kanji in order to deal with homophones.</p>\n\n<p>Why was korea able to remove it even though Korean has homophones but japan hasn't? I am strictly focusing on the question of is kanji necessitated by homophones and if yes how?</p>\n\n<p>------------- EDIT ---------------------------\n<p>Apparently relying on context alone is not enough.  In Japanese tv the frequently use subtitles/kanji to remove ambiguity.
