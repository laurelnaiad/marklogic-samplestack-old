{"Body":"<p>In non-agglutinative languages we have certain word classes that would be considered productive, and we have word classes that wouldn't. Morphological inflection, on the other hand, is from my knowledge (please correct me otherwise) not ever considered productive. Is this the case in agglutinative languages as well, i.e. is the production only occurring on a root-level? Productive morphology would otherwise sound like a fascinating topic!</p>\n", "Id":"6393", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Have agglutinative languages productive morphology?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T08:03:13.370", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1750", "Tags":"<morphology><agglutination>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"40", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T14:43:50.367", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"17", "Location":"Uppsala, Sweden", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1750", "AccountId":"1843509", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"211", "CreationDate":"2013-02-11T00:31:45.213", "DisplayName":"Jimmy Callin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T12:59:28.293", "AboutMe":"<p>Student of computational lingustics at Uppsala University in Sweden.</p>\n", "Age":"24"}}
