{"Body":"<p>Over on English Language and Usage, there are many, many questions of the form \"What is a single word for [phrase]\".</p>\n\n<p>The poster usually seems to be very keen to use a single word — which may be obscure, or have a subtly different meaning — than to use the idiomatic multiple word phrase that a native English speaker would always choose to use.</p>\n\n<p>For example (and this is not intended as a slur on the questioner), one poster wants single word for \"lack of clarity\" — \"unclarity\", \"obscurity\", \"ambiguity\" are all unsatisfactory suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>I am assuming that the questioners are not native English speakers, and wonder whether there is something about their native language that leads them to expect English to have a vocabulary full of words with very specific meanings.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: is there a characteristic of non-English languages such that single words are considered particularly desirable? What families of language show this characteristic in particular?</p>\n", "Id":"1223", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1227", "Title":"The hunger for single words", "CreationDate":"2012-01-03T19:02:28.260", "OwnerUserId":"644", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-23T12:56:58.520", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
