{"Body":"<p>I have recently applied for an English teaching position in Brazil and had to take a test in which they asked:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Choose the correct part of speech for '<strong>FOUND</strong>' in the setence \"A whale <strong>found</strong> dead on the southern Spanish coast was found to have swallowed 17 kg of plastic waste, including plastic bags.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The options were:\na) Noun\nb) Adjective\nc) Verb\nd) Adverb</p>\n\n<p>I chose letter C, as I assumed it was a reduced passive. When the key to the test was made public they considered letter B as the correct option.</p>\n\n<p>I got confused.... From what I understood, although there is an adjective clause I was supposed to give the part of speech. I felt mislead. But I'm not sure I have misinterpreted the question itself. I thought about formally requiring the anullment of this question. What do you think about it? </p>\n", "Id":"6119", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"What part of speech is 'found' in this sentence?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-11T22:06:49.617", "OwnerUserId":"2859", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><parts-of-speech>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-12T07:40:26.620", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"160", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-12T07:40:26.620", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/633433065/picture?type=large", "Id":"2859", "AccountId":"3717176", "CreationDate":"2013-12-11T22:05:54.393", "AboutMe":"", "Location":"Bras√≠lia, Brazil", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"26", "DisplayName":"Juliana Ulharuzo", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-12T16:14:03.230"}}
