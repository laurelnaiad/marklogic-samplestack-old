{"Body":"<p><strong>Is the etymology of the word \"<em>semen</em>\" (eng. \"seed\") in Latin connected to the hebrew word שֶׁמֶן \"<em>shemen</em>\" (eng. \"ointment\")?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've just read a <a href=\"http://www.davidjayjordan.com/AnnointedWife.html\">peculiar article</a> that attempted to make this connection:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The word for \"ointment(s)\" here in the Hebrew is SHEMEN meaning \"ointment, oil, fat, cream, fertility\". This word is almost certainly the origin for the Latin word \"semen\" meaning \"seed\", from which we get our English word \"semen\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The context is the \"<a href=\"http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/OTpdf/can1.pdf\">Song of songs</a>\" book from the Bible. The coincidences are interesting: Song of Songs is an erotic poem, there is phonetic similarity between \"shemen\" and \"semen\", and the meaning \"ointment\" that could refer to sperm.</p>\n\n<p>But then, this could just be a coincidence. Can anyone disprove that the latin \"semen\" is not derived from or related to the hebrew \"shemen\"? </p>\n", "Id":"2451", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2452", "Title":"Hebrew \"shemen\" versus Latin \"semen\"", "CreationDate":"2012-08-22T09:27:12.757", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<etymology><latin><hebrew>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1275", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"663", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-11T12:17:02.013", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://staltz.blogspot.com", "Id":"1275", "AccountId":"122140", "CreationDate":"2012-08-22T09:06:57.690", "AboutMe":"<p>Software Developer.
