{"Body":"<p>I'm processing a large corpus for a given language. I've noticed that for certain sections of the corpus, I can go many tens of thousands of words without the word \"me\" being mentioned. These are obviously the parts of the corpus with more technical data.</p>\n\n<p>I'm primarily interested in <strong>words and phrases</strong> used in everyday casual speech and am wondering what words i can search for in order to find those parts of the corpus which are more suitable to my particular application.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of my suggestions: me, you, he, she, them, our, ours, their, theirs, my, your, mine, yours you're, i, \"i am\", \"you are\". So I would expect these words to have a higher frequency of occurrence in those parts of the corpus of most relevance. What other words and phrases would you suggest? Is there a danger that I bias my results in a manner I haven't anticipated? </p>\n", "Id":"3351", "LastEditorUserId":"1835", "Title":"Words and phrases more likely in everyday speech", "CreationDate":"2013-03-10T18:29:32.980", "OwnerUserId":"1835", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<corpora><vocabulary><frequency>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-10T20:39:53.623", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"196", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-10T21:39:45.557", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}}
