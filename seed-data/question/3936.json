{"Body":"<p>I was rather surprised to learn that the Chinese word for \"mommy\" is māmā. </p>\n\n<p>It never surprised me to hear that this word is similar among Western languages, because of some common origin or borrowing reasons. But then, it looks like this word is the same in Eastern languages like Chinese (and also Japanese). </p>\n\n<p>Is this just because \"ma\" is the maybe the \"easiest\" syllable to articulate for a child?
