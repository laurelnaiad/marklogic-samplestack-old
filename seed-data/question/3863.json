{"Body":"<p>I'm sorry for putting up such a specific question here but any help will be really appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Akha is the language spoken by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akha_people\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akha people</a> of southern China (Yunnan Province), eastern Burma (Shan State), northern Laos, and northern Thailand. Linguists consider Akha to be a dialect of the Hani language.</p>\n\n<p>I'm translating a Korean short story into English. The text contains a few Akha words or expressions. The problem is if I follow the Korean Romanization the result looks nothing close to what little I have seen of the original Akha language. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the following is the romanization of the original Korean transcription of the Akha phrases. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My friend, hello. - Dosha, domialla. (Korean transcription 도샤, 도미알라.)</li>\n<li>My son, good bye. - Ari, domialla. (Korean transcription 아리, 도미알라.)</li>\n<li>I'm fine.    - Shyejei mangneu. (Korean transcription 셰제이 망느.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The only Akha words I could find on the internet were the ones for 'friend' (chawv) and son (ahv leeh), which as you can see look very different from the romanized versions. </p>\n\n<p>Any linguist here who can help me out with the original Akha wording? </p>\n", "Id":"3863", "Title":"How do I romanize words from the Akha Language?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-16T06:43:58.443", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2161", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic><transcription>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"65", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-25T02:26:56.470", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2161", "AccountId":"2544744", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"111", "CreationDate":"2013-06-16T06:09:58.357", "DisplayName":"Soulz", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-21T13:03:44.820", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm interested in literary translation.
