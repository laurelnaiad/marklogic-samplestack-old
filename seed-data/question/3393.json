I discovered Computational Linguistics while receiving my B.A.Sc in Software Engineering when I built a basic bigram parser for an AI assignment. This caused me to become interested in linguistics and to take a few introductory level courses. I currently have completed my first year of my masters and am currently looking for a thesis topic.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"832", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-19T16:32:19.643", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.tiksn.info", "Location":"Yerevan, Armenia", "Id":"1585", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"893560", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"67", "CreationDate":"2012-12-13T21:15:51.463", "DisplayName":"TIKSN", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-17T10:53:07.767", "Age":"23"}}
