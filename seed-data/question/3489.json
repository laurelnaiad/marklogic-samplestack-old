{"Body":"<p>I have an assignment for my machine translation class which involves using the different language versions of websites as parallel corpora. The problem is the text isn't properly aligned.</p>\n\n<p>For example: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/ie/terms-and-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ryanair.com/ie/terms-and-conditions</a> </p>\n\n<p>vs </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/de/geschaeftsbedingungen#regulations-aircarrierinformation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ryanair.com/de/geschaeftsbedingungen#regulations-aircarrierinformation</a></p>\n\n<p>According to textmechanic.com the English version has 481 sentences / 807 lines and the German version has 533 sentences / 909 lines.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know of any way to automate / verify the text aligning process? We have a tried writing our own Java program to match as many sentences as possible and throw away ones which don't match. However, we encountered errors at punctuation such as full stops for Mr. / Mrs., etc.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have any experience dealing with this sort of situation?</p>\n", "Id":"3489", "LastEditorUserId":"1767", "Title":"Automated methods to align text", "CreationDate":"2013-04-03T09:11:48.797", "OwnerUserId":"1930", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<corpora><translation><machine-translation><statistical-mt>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-03T16:27:57.743", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"24", "Location":"Sweden", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1767", "AccountId":"10219", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"212", "CreationDate":"2013-02-16T09:52:22.057", "DisplayName":"igelkott", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T12:53:17.277"}, "ViewCount":"83", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-17T15:30:37.753", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1930", "AccountId":"960562", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"131", "CreationDate":"2013-04-03T08:58:11.743", "DisplayName":"Tom celic", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-22T16:36:36.463"}}
