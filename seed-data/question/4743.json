{"Body":"<p>I'm looking to write my undergraduate dissertation (10,000 words) within the topics of ergativity and/or valency but currently stuck for ideas.</p>\n\n<p>My first idea was to take a sample from around 20 - 30 languages and investigate whether there is a link between ergative languages and their possible valency changing constructions compared to accusative languages. My tutor told me that it's been done before and I should try attempt something more original but I'm completely lost. </p>\n\n<p>Can anyone offer any advice/help? Is there anything I could read which might inspire another research question? Or any current debates surrounding this field that I could look into? </p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n", "Id":"4743", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Help with BA dissertation topic related to ergativity and/or valency", "CreationDate":"2013-10-17T14:43:51.910", "OwnerUserId":"2604", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><linguistic-typology><ergativity><valency>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-18T03:46:45.530", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"84", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-18T03:46:45.530", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a893d9ec839171a116aef80da741c16?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2604", "AccountId":"3451380", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-10-17T14:43:51.910", "DisplayName":"Charlotte", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-17T21:44:29.637"}}
