{"Body":"<p>I have always been interested in examining Tu/Mongour and Bonan language. Mongour is a Mongolic language which is spoken by Mongour people who may be the descendants of Xianbei people who moved from Eastern Mongolia to Gansu-Qinghai to establish Tanghut dynasty or they may be descendants of Mongolians left behind when Yuan dynasty collapsed. Bonan language is also Mongolic and spoken by Bonan people. Yet, interestingly, some of Mongour are Taoist and Bonan are Muslim as opposed by most of the Mongols being Tibetan Buddhist.</p>\n\n<p>What are the percentages of Mongolian, Tibetan, Turkic, Chinese or Qiangic words used in Mongour and Bonan languages? Do someone has the answer or what are reliable resources?</p>\n", "Id":"2573", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Are there any extensive study on the vocabulary used in the Mongour and Bonan languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-19T07:03:27.520", "OwnerUserId":"425", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><vocabulary><mongolic-languages>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-09T06:06:56.390", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"74", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-09T06:06:56.390", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dagvadorj.blogspot.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"425", "AccountId":"72399", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"128", "CreationDate":"2011-10-15T17:35:46.773", "DisplayName":"Dagvadorj", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-17T10:03:22.937"}}
