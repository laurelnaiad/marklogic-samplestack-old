{"Body":"<p>Many readability statistics ask that numbers in the text be pronounced to determine the number of syllables.  What I'm struggling with is if longer numbers are considered one or more than one word. As an example is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>23,578</strong></p>\n\n<p>treated as...</p>\n\n<p><strong>twenty three thousand five hundred seventy eight</strong></p>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<p><strong>twentythreethousandfivehundredseventyeight</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is particularly an issue with the SMOG formula that \nrequires hyphyenated words to be treated as a single word. </p>\n\n<p>I guess the question is how to convert numeric symbols into written words that is appropriate for readability statistics.  If you have a source (I have searched <a href=\"http://www.ebscohost.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EBSCOhost</a> for a while to no avail) that backs up what you say please share.</p>\n", "Id":"1220", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1221", "Title":"Numbers as words", "CreationDate":"2012-01-02T16:14:43.553", "OwnerUserId":"607", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<applied-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-03T10:12:01.900", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
