{"Body":"<p>Steven Pinker in \"The Language Instinct\" claims that there is strong psychological evidence for the existence of a sharp age cutoff for the ability to acquire a flawless foreign accent (I may dig up the exact reference, if needed). In other words, there is a fairly narrow age threshold (around 20-odd years) below which exposure to a foreign accent is more or less sufficient to acquire it and above which it's physiologically impossible. Has this phenomenon been confirmed or refuted by any systematic study?</p>\n", "Id":"1280", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Evidence for age cutoff in foreign accent acquistion", "CreationDate":"2012-01-14T18:04:29.473", "OwnerUserId":"673", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><psycholinguistics><critical-period>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-17T18:45:46.870", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1491", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-12T05:08:23.903", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "Location":"Warsaw, Poland", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"673", "AccountId":"180132", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"151", "CreationDate":"2012-01-14T17:54:05.430", "DisplayName":"Marcin Kotowski", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-10T14:12:46.150", "AboutMe":"<p>Graduate student in quantum information (IQC/University of Waterloo).</p>\n"}}
