{"Body":"<p>This thought occured to me after having a closed question read here. I drew five language trees for a same sentence rendered in five different languages, and the result was quite  interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Sentences were structured a little bit differently according to a type, and so were the language trees.</p>\n\n<p>I was taking English, Russian, FÃ­nnish, Estonian and Swedish as sample languages. Then I wrote and structured it in Dutch, Spanish, Polish, Bulgarian and French. </p>\n\n<p>The languages, however different in their typologies, have some similar features (e.g. English is more like Swedish, and Finnish is much like Estonian). There were also differences in language trees depending on language analytism, flections and possible word order. The differences may be, however, described by submodalities of personal ideolect as well. I have not compared yet the languages by the thorough atlas with wide parameter scope.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, my knowledge of other languages (e.g. that of Arabic, Yoruba or Chinese) was not sufficient to present more data on languages of other types, so I am presenting this question to the Community.</p>\n\n<p>If they are, then what is the main typological factor for the language tree discrepancy?</p>\n", "Id":"3404", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "Title":"Are languages of different types described by different structures in language trees?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-19T16:25:54.890", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><linguistic-typology><generative-grammar>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-19T19:20:00.637", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
