{"Body":"<p>Mereological theories of events usually assume that the domain of events forms a join semilattice with no bottom element.(Landman 2004's \"Indefinites and the Type of Sets\" is one of the few exceptions I've found.) There are probably good reasons that most researchers assume that there is no bottom element - i.e., I assume that there are negative consequences to assuming a bottom element, and that these have been discussed somewhere in the literature.</p>\n\n<p>What are some of these negative consequences?
