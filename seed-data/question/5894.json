{"Body":"<p>I just met the persian/hindi word \"jadoo\". Given its meaning and sound, I would guess that it is etymologically connected to \"voodoo\", possibly having a common ancestry. I would like to confirm/refute such theory. An initial quick research on it took me nowhere. I can see where each word came from to a certain extent, but I can't get any conclusive information. \"voodoo\" came from north africa, but I couldn't figure out for how long it has been used there. \"jadoo\" is a persian word, and I also can't figure out dates for usage. Since these peoples are geographically somewhat close and their cultures were in several points in history mixed/connected, the relation seem even more plausible. Does anyone know if they are connected? If nobody knows, what can I do to investigate this further, or to be certain of it?</p>\n", "Id":"5894", "AcceptedAnswerId":"5896", "Title":"etymology - voodoo/jadoo", "CreationDate":"2013-11-12T23:11:12.773", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<etymology>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2714", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"101", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-14T15:54:53.250", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c30e9927de2a623831360a8b6ea20811?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2714", "AccountId":"2376937", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"113", "CreationDate":"2013-11-12T22:58:13.830", "DisplayName":"msb", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-04T22:58:44.073", "AboutMe":"<p>twit me at @msbarrios</p>\n"}}
