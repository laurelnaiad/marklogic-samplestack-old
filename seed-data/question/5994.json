{"Body":"<p>My question is to try to find the origin of the word kokkova. I have an antique/primitive pin made of ivory which if  I had to guess would say that it is walrus but not 100% sure. It is scrimshawed with a basic line design and the word Kokkova. (it is possible that the \"v\" is an \"r\") I thought it could be an inuit piece but again unable to say definitively. Thanks, Devo</p>\n", "Id":"5994", "Title":"Kokkova or kokkora carved on ivory", "CreationDate":"2013-11-24T17:30:15.057", "OwnerUserId":"2775", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-24T17:30:15.057", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2775", "AccountId":"3631921", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-11-24T17:30:15.057", "DisplayName":"David", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-02T03:10:54.540"}}
