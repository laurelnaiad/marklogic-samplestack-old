{"Body":"<p>Most English words can be traced to their Latin, Greek, or other roots in any common dictionary. However, is there a Latin-to-English counterpart that would list current English words that are derived from a specific Latin word?</p>\n\n<p>The question stems from coming across the terms \"Servatis a periculo\" and \"Servatis a malefico\" from an Evanescence song. After discovering that the English word \"saviour\" is derived from \"servatis\" the meaning of the phrases becomes easier to grasp. I am not actively studying Latin so access to such a resource would help greatly in the few times that I need to understand a Latin word.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n", "Id":"1866", "ClosedDate":"2012-05-02T20:52:11.203", "Title":"List of English words that came from specific words in Latin", "CreationDate":"2012-05-02T16:24:58.827", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"536", "Tags":"<etymology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-02T17:57:34.510", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
