{"Body":"<p>I had an argument with someone recently and figured I should find out, so I went on a research spree and could not find any authoritative answers on the subject. </p>\n\n<p>I am sure there are many disputes about how one should write numbers, as digits (0-9) or as words (one, two, three....)</p>\n\n<p>I just want to know about one particular subset of this.</p>\n\n<p>If I want to write <code>'Three cookies'</code> is it <strong><em>incorrect</em></strong> to write <code>'3 cookies'</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Context:</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that when wanting to write <em>large</em> numbers, it is acceptable to write with digits, like in the case of <code>'4356 people showed up to the event'</code> since it would be sort of silly to write <code>'four thousand three hundred and fifty six people showed up to the event'</code> but in the case of <em>single</em> digits, I was always told I should write the number out fully, and not just use the digit.</p>\n\n<p>I hope my question is clear, I do not want to start a discussion or a debate about anything other than the particular case of writing a <em>single</em> digit versus writing out the word.
