{"Body":"<p>I frequently travel to Nicaragua and interact with a group of children who are learning ISN (Nicaraguan Sign Language) at their school. I have no experience with ASL (other than a friend teaching me a handful of signs), but it seems that ISN shares at least some things in common with ASL (primarily the alphabet, as well as some other signs). My understanding was that ISN developed fairly independently of outside influence.</p>\n\n<p>What elements are shared between the two languages (lexically, grammatically, etc.)? Was there early influence of ASL on ISN or are these recent borrowings?</p>\n", "Id":"2941", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"What similarities are there between Nicaraguan (ISN) and American (ASL) Sign Language?", "CreationDate":"2012-12-06T05:25:02.437", "OwnerUserId":"1502", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><sign-languages><asl>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-07T11:45:25.170", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"134", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-09T01:06:03.593", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"31", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1502", "AccountId":"123960", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"185", "CreationDate":"2012-11-16T04:52:30.657", "DisplayName":"jrdioko", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-10T04:35:54.873"}}
