{"Body":"<p>How do linguists define the idea of a grammatical subject?</p>\n\n<p>The only place I could find on the Internet about linguists' definition of a grammatical subject was at the SIL glossary, here.  (<a href=\"http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsASubject.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsASubject.htm</a>).   </p>\n\n<p>According to this definition, grammatical subjects often have...</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"The grammatical characteristics of the agent of typically transitive verbs\"\n\"The grammatical characteristics of the single argument of intransitive verbs\"\n\"A particular case marking or clause position\"\n\"The conditioning of an agreement affix on the verb\"\n\"The capability of being obligatorily or optionally deleted in certain grammatical constructions, such as the following clauses:   Adverbial, Complement, Coordinate\"\n\"The conditioning of same subject markers and different subject markers in switch-reference systems\"\n\"The capability of co-reference with reflexive pronouns\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The definition doesn't imply that all grammatical subjects in all languages have all of these characteristics.  </p>\n\n<p>But I was wondering whether this definition passes muster among the professional linguists on this list.   If not, is there are better source of information about what grammatical subjects are? </p>\n", "Id":"4079", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4083", "Title":"How do linguists define the idea of a grammatical subject?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-30T06:20:43.460", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><terminology><grammatical-subject>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-31T00:11:59.003", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"178", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-05T05:57:41.763", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
