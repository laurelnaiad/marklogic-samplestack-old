{"Body":"<p>This is just my observation, but it seems like Standard American English lacks any distinct accent when speaking. Listen to almost any person singing with an accent, and they sound like any American singing! I suppose this could be because America has had so many accents thrown on to it that it's averaged out, perhaps. Is there any explanation for this?</p>\n", "Id":"2405", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2407", "Title":"Why do people singing in English sound like Americans?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-10T01:11:06.793", "OwnerUserId":"958", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><dialects><american-english><accent>", "AnswerCount":"6", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-10T06:44:49.337", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1860", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-06T21:44:46.997", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"40", "WebsiteUrl":"http://labbook.net", "Id":"958", "AccountId":"266116", "CreationDate":"2012-04-26T04:27:19.147", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently a junior at Penn State pursuing a B.Phil. in Linguistics and a B.S. in Psychology with minors in Arabic and Statistics.
