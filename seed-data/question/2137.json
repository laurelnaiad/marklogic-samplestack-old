{"Body":"<p>I am confused about the meaning of markedness. From the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markedness\">Wikipedia</a> page I read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The dominant term is known as the 'unmarked' term and the other, secondary one is the 'marked' term. In other words, it is the characterization of a \"normal\" linguistic unit (i.e. the unmarked term) compared to the unit's possible \"irregular\" forms (i.e. the marked term).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe that \"dominant\" means more frequent, but is it dominant inside one language or considering all natural languages together?</p>\n", "Id":"2137", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"0", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2140", "Title":"What is markedness?", "CreationDate":"2012-06-19T09:55:17.393", "OwnerUserId":"1050", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><markedness>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-15T21:28:07.307", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"619", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-15T21:28:07.307", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "WebsiteUrl":"http://blog.thegrandlocus.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1050", "AccountId":"1298190", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"160", "CreationDate":"2012-05-26T16:50:12.063", "DisplayName":"gui11aume", "LastAccessDate":"2012-08-06T17:33:01.183", "AboutMe":"<p>I am the head of a research team in genomics.
