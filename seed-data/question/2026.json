{"Body":"<p>I would like to know whether nasally produced sounds like \"Mmmm\" or \"Hmmm\" constitute verbal or non-verbal language.  Essentially I am a language testing professional, operating within very narrowly defined boundaries of permissible interaction.  In this case verbal interaction is forbidden, but body language is encouraged.  </p>\n\n<p>I am attempting to resolve the issue of whether the words above are part of body language or not.  I would like to make it clear that these sounds are nasal in nature, produced with the lips sealed and can convey multiple meanings.  They are distinct from other sounds like \"uh\", \"ah-ha\" or \"eh\" that would be produced using the mouth.  In addition the nasal \"hmmm\" is different from the \"hmmm / h'm\" or \"hem\" which is produced as a slight cough.  I appreciate you taking the time to deal with this query.   </p>\n", "Id":"2026", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2030", "Title":"Status of \"Mmm\" or \"Hmm\"", "CreationDate":"2012-05-31T10:38:09.347", "OwnerUserId":"1063", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-01T15:09:44.360", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
