{"Body":"<p>I saw a post on ELU about a more general question, <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/50246/softened-pronunciation-of-consonants-such-as-t-or-s-followed-by-y\">Softened pronunciation of consonants, such as “t” or “s” followed by “y”</a>. The question was answered in regard to palatalization, especially for phrases like \"but you\", where /t/ is followed by a palatal glide, /j/.</p>\n\n<p>But does \"palatalization\" also explain the affrication of /t/ and /d/ when they're followed by /ɹ/, instead of by a front vowel or a palatal consonant? E.g. in 'tram' or 'address' (but not necessarily in 'string'?)</p>\n\n<p>I could see how the affricates are closer to the palatal position than the stops, but the trigger for the change doesn't seem to be a following palatal consonant. (Typical English \n/ɹ/'s place of articulation is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_approximant\">described as alveolar</a> rather than palatal.) </p>\n\n<p>Is this an example of a case where \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization#Mechanism\">tongue-raising typically affects apical and coronal consonants</a>\", i.e. palatalizes them?</p>\n\n<p>This question is explored some at <a href=\"http://literalminded.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/chricky-affrication/\">http://literalminded.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/chricky-affrication/</a> and its follow-up blog posts, but I didn't see a definitive answer for what causes the change, or what the process is called.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. See also John Well's post <a href=\"http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-do-we-pronounce-train.html\">how do we pronounce train ?</a>, which is interesting: the \"allophonic rule that retracts t and d when followed by r\" - what rule is that and what causes it?</p>\n\n<p>Strangely, when asked about \"the shift of any alveolar plosive preceding a rhotic consonant to a post alveolar affricate,\" Wells concludes \"I don’t believe there is any such phonological change in progress.\" I really don't understand how that conclusion is justified.</p>\n", "Id":"1104", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1106", "Title":"Why are /t/ and /d/ sometimes affricated before /ɹ/ in English?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-01T21:09:36.890", "OwnerUserId":"176", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><palatalization><affricates>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-02T12:44:48.430", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"527", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-03T02:17:23.400", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"176", "AccountId":"186022", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"155", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T14:38:41.147", "DisplayName":"LarsH", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-24T20:08:38.940"}}
