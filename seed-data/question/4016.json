{"Body":"<p>From what I've read (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_case</a>) applicative voice occurs when an oblique noun phrase becomes an argument of the verb when the verb takes some applicative morpheme.   As the article points out, <em>something</em> like this happens in English when a sentence like \"Jack ran faster than the giant\" becomes \"Jack outran the giant.\"  But in the many other languages that mark verbs with applicative morphemes, applicative voice is much more productive.   </p>\n\n<p>The article states that \"A language may have multiple applicatives, each corresponding to such different roles as comitative, locative, instrumental, and benefactive.\"    </p>\n\n<p>So my question is, do applicative verbs marked for such roles ever govern different cases?   For example, is there a language in which a verb marked with a benefactive applicative morpheme must have an argument or \"object\" in benefactive case?</p>\n", "Id":"4016", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4018", "Title":"Do applicative verbs ever govern the cases of their objects?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-16T04:57:12.940", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><morphology><verbs><cases>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-16T06:14:20.050", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"101", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-16T10:54:23.463", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
