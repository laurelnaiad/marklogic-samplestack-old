{"Body":"<p>I have an intuition, and Hypothesis, that the native language we speak is responsible for our cognition and thinking skills.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. Hebrew speaking people would have poor spatial ability compared to Sanskrit speakers because Hebrew has a simple morpho-spatial structure compared to Sanskrit. </p>\n\n<p>If we come to the mathematics language domain, then it's very clear that different representations are comprehended differently by the human mind, and that we are better able to think in, say, the \"geometrical domain\". Hence transforming a problem to different domain is a common practice in mathematics to ease understanding of the problem and solve it efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>e.g: It's easier to prove a certain theorem geometrically than algebraically</p>\n\n<p>Also, it could be the other way round: our cognitive abilities could determine the language that would fit our ability, making language dependent on the innate cognition of the human mind.</p>\n", "Id":"3274", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Does language influence thinking skills or cognition", "CreationDate":"2013-02-25T15:38:44.543", "OwnerUserId":"1758", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><cognitive-linguistics><sapir-whorf-hypothesis>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-29T02:25:14.153", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"191", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-29T02:25:14.153", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EVrHW.jpg", "Id":"1758", "AccountId":"904615", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"170", "CreationDate":"2013-02-13T05:16:10.560", "DisplayName":"Ali", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-15T10:46:17.913"}}
