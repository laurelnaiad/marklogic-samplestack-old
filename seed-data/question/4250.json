{"Body":"<p>In <em>The Discourse Basis of Ergativity</em> published in Language in 1987, John W. Du Bois proposed a theory which stated that (p. 850)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[universally] the distribution of new information vs. old information [as well as the distribution of lexical vs. non-lexical arguments] is correllated with the ergative/\n  absolutive structural opposition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to him, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>language-internal phenomena as basic as the system of grammatical relations can be structured by forces arising out of discourse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, the S=P alignment found in ergative languages is said to be a manifestation of the pattern in discourse, which also shows S=P alignment of new information (pragmatic dimension of the <em>Preferred Argument Structure</em>) and noun phrases (lexical dimension). Note that Du Bois gives several examples for languages (next to the one he observed) that also seem to show that alignment, among others German, Quechua and English (p. 839).</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is where I come in:</strong> In a recent homework, I tried to find supporting/contradictory evidence in another corpus. My own data did in the end confirm Du Bois' theory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong>, a former professor now \"published\" a manuscript, in which he argues that (Haig/Schnell p. 40) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>outside Du Bois' original data, evidence in support of an S=P unity in discourse are strikingly absent</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the claim that cross-linguistically, connected discourse exhibits a characteristically ergative profile, such that intransitive subjects and objects pattern alike, is in fact an artifact of a highly marked corpus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For this reason, I would like to ask you if you yourself have reason to believe that either of the two positions is correct. Ideally, <strong>try to confirm/refute Du Bois' theory on a <em>Preferred Argument Structure</em> based on findings of your own.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can see how this question might provoke a discussion rather than definite answers. But as a clear, scholarly response is what I am aiming at here, feel free to give advice on how I could improve this question!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Both articles are available online.</p>\n\n<p>Du Bois (1987): <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/415719\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jstor.org/stable/415719</a></p>\n\n<p>Haig/Schnell (2013): <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/3403768/The_discourse_basis_of_ergativity_revisited\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.academia.edu/3403768/The_discourse_basis_of_ergativity_revisited</a> (Note that this paper is still marked  \"unpublished manuscript\"!)</p>\n\n<p>The sample data I worked with was taken from the corpus developped in the project described here:\n<a href=\"http://www.hrelp.org/grants/projects/index.php?projid=131\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hrelp.org/grants/projects/index.php?projid=131</a></p>\n", "Id":"4250", "LastEditorUserId":"2317", "Title":"Is there any evidence pro/contra Du Bois' Preferred Argument Structure (ergative patterning in discourse)?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-25T11:05:30.480", "OwnerUserId":"2317", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<linguistic-universals><pragmatics><universal-grammar><ergativity><discourse>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-29T19:51:26.320", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://rpubs.com/mj_at_rpubs/", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2317", "AccountId":"2905517", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"36", "CreationDate":"2013-08-04T21:38:50.170", "DisplayName":"maj", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:25:47.270", "AboutMe":"<p>Undergraduate Student of Computer Engineering and Linguistics at Christian-Albrechts-Universität Kiel.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"83", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-29T19:51:26.320", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://rpubs.com/mj_at_rpubs/", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2317", "AccountId":"2905517", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"36", "CreationDate":"2013-08-04T21:38:50.170", "DisplayName":"maj", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:25:47.270", "AboutMe":"<p>Undergraduate Student of Computer Engineering and Linguistics at Christian-Albrechts-Universität Kiel.</p>\n"}}
