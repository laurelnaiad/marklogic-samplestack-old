{"Body":"<p>Allophones are defined by means of complementary distribution. As I understand it, a complementary distribution is a \"mutually exclusive\" relationship between two phones, with regard to a certain phonetic environment. That is, one of the phones will <em>only</em> be found in that environment (and nowhere else) while the other phone will <em>never</em> be found in that environment (but will be found somewhere else).</p>\n\n<p>For example, In English, [pʰ] and [p] are allophones of the phoneme /p/, since [pʰ] can be found at the beginning of syllables ([pʰɪn]) and nowhere else. Likewise, [p] is never found at the beginning of syllables, but can be found in other positions ([spɪn]). Summarizing in a table:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jqKkf.png\" alt=\"Phoneme /p/ in English\"></p>\n\n<p>Now, in Brazilian Portuguese, [w] and [l] are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_phonology#Oral_diphthongs\" rel=\"nofollow\">considered allophones of /l/</a>. The reasoning is similar: [l] is never found at the end of syllables, but can be found in other places ([a.'kli.vi], \"slope\"). [w], on the other hand, is found at the end of syllables ([saw], \"salt\"). The problem is: [w] <em>can also be found</em> elsewhere ([a.'kwi;.fe.ru], \"aquifer\"). The table for this distribution, therefore, would be like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nquJd.png\" alt=\"Phoneme /l/ in Brazilian Portuguese\"></p>\n\n<p>This means that, in some environments both [w] and [l] can be found, as in the [a.'kli.vi] versus [a'.kwi.fe.ru] example. So, evidently, I'm failing to understand what \"complementary distribution\" really is. Any help to clarify the concept would be much appreciated!</p>\n", "Id":"2192", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2194", "Title":"What is the definition of \"complementary distribution\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-01T01:13:57.933", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><terminology>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-01T16:42:32.073", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
