{"Body":"<p>I am a math and statistics student/enthusiast as well as a fiction writer with cultivated interest in a few foreign languages. Linguistics has held appeal to me for many years, but I admit to having only had a cursory introduction to the field. </p>\n\n<p>Lately I have been searching for an access point and quite naturally turned to <a href=\"http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1963-7ChomskyAlgebraic.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Algebraic Theory of Context-Free Languages</em></a> by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger. I assume that reading this text is, at this point in time, as much like reading history as it is like reading linguistics, but I have been stimulated nonetheless, especially by all the possibilities of connecting algebra and linguistics. </p>\n\n<p>My questions are the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> What other (past or current) papers are worth reading <em>for a non-linguist</em> to develop an adequate view of the linguistic landscape? </li>\n<li> In your opinion, what are some linguistic papers/ideas/schools of thought that might interest someone who is part-mathematician, part-humanist?</li>\n<li> For the linguists out there: is there a book or paper about linguistics that you wish everyone in society would read?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, one more (possibly too esoteric) question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> Does anyone know of applications of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Gröbner bases</em></a> in (computational) linguistics? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks so much for humoring the questions of an outsider. I look forward to your responses!</p>\n\n<p>Nathan</p>\n", "Id":"5978", "Title":"Writer/math student seeking an overview of linguistics.
