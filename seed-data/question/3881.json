{"Body":"<p>I'm rephrasing my question after (very helpful) comments to my initial version:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What are the differences between the [i] produced by French speakers (in French) and English speakers (in English)?</li>\n<li>Does the English [i] ever occur in a context such as C_C i.e: [ʃi:p] where minimal pairs are possible without the lengthening? Is this a redundancy built into the language so [i]~[ɪ] can be discriminated?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Previous title</strong>: [ɪ]~[i] production by native French speakers of English - why is [ɪ] the 'default'?</p>\n\n<p>My assumption is that the vowel [ɪ] does not exist in (standard) French even as an allophone. When (mis)pronouncing sheet/shit, beach/bitch, etc, anecdotal tellings of this particular error seems to favour the [ɪ] in terms of occurrence (if someone can point to an actual study that would be appreciated).</p>\n\n<p>Is the French [i] of 'livre' /livʁ/ known to be far shorter in duration than the English [i] in 'leave' /li:v/? When 'leave' is pronounced by a French speaker as /liv/ (note: correct vowel, but not lengthened) is this being perceived by native English speakers as an occurrence of 'live' /lɪv/?</p>\n", "Id":"3881", "LastEditorUserId":"1486", "Title":"What are the differences between the French and English [i] and how does it affect the perception?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-20T10:02:14.303", "OwnerUserId":"1486", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><english><vowels><second-lang-acquisition><french>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-21T07:22:03.533", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1486", "AccountId":"1743332", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"46", "CreationDate":"2012-11-11T11:59:17.790", "DisplayName":"sanlikestabbies", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-22T01:36:44.220", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"317", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-24T17:31:43.923", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"13", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1486", "AccountId":"1743332", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"46", "CreationDate":"2012-11-11T11:59:17.790", "DisplayName":"sanlikestabbies", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-22T01:36:44.220", "AboutMe":""}}
