{"Body":"<p>Dictionaries contain near 80,000 entries (less or more than that) and most of those entries have phonetic pronunciations written beside them.</p>\n\n<p>However, English might have more than a million words, if we count <em>every</em> word which can be distinguished from others by looking at its characters.</p>\n\n<p>For example, while teach, teacher, and teaching are words with the same root, they actually have different characters which usually result in having different pronunciations.</p>\n\n<p>This way we might say that more than 400,000 English words don't have a formal phonetics representation written down in any dictionary for them. However, some words do need to have phonetics. Names are good examples. How should one pronounce Archimedes for example?</p>\n\n<p>I just wonder if it's possible to create phonetics based on morphological analysis of a given word or not? Does such a tool exist online? Does it mean that dictionaries can create phonetics for almost any given word?</p>\n", "Id":"2453", "LastEditorUserId":"1276", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Is it possible to create English phonetics of a given word with correct morphology, and phonology?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-22T17:03:08.997", "OwnerUserId":"141", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><phonetics><english>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-23T12:08:27.193", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8YRq.jpg", "Id":"1276", "AccountId":"1234954", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"103", "CreationDate":"2012-08-23T10:26:17.950", "DisplayName":"Noah", "LastAccessDate":"2012-09-15T07:56:43.853", "Age":"18"}, "ViewCount":"170", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-01T04:47:15.300", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"28", "WebsiteUrl":"http://nefcanto.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0DNFU.jpg", "Id":"141", "AccountId":"429080", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T10:02:38.127", "AboutMe":"<p>Enthusiast in computer, music, language, philosophy, mathematics, and physics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/89cbd3c64c8e454496e77db95e6d5c03\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/89cbd3c64c8e454496e77db95e6d5c03.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Saeed on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Saeed on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n", "Age":"32", "Location":"Tehran, Iran", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"283", "DisplayName":"Saeed Neamati", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T13:29:16.983"}}
