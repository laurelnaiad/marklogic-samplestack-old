{"Body":"<p>The 22 categories of words used in Carl Darling Buck's \"A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages\" (1949) are quite different from for instance the categories in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aOutline_of_Roget%27s_Thesaurus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roget's thesaurus as of 1911</a>. There is no background in the book itself on how the 22 categories where chosen. Did Buck make the list himself or was he following some (undocumented?) tradition?</p>\n\n<p>Buck's categories are used in at least two other projects, <a href=\"http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/ids/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IDS</a> and <a href=\"http://wold.livingsources.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WOLD</a>, which attribute the categories to Buck. It is a little odd that the history of this categorization-scheme seems to be missing.</p>\n", "Id":"633", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1013", "Title":"Where did the semantic categories of C.
