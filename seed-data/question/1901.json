{"Body":"<p>From my own experience, drinking alcohol has both positive and negative effects to the ability of speaking a second language. On the one hand, it facilitates the process, mainly because one gets more relaxed and less inhibited (thus caring less about making mistakes, as long as one gets the message across). On the other hand, alcohol affects muscle control, makes reasoning slower, impacts memory and so on. These are all extremely important abilities when speaking a second language, so the intoxication makes it harder.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: have the effects of alcohol on second language speaking been studied scientifically? What are the main results?</p>\n", "Id":"1901", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"5", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1902", "Title":"How does alcohol affect the ability to speak a second language?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-08T22:02:43.457", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><neurolinguistics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-08T22:34:01.673", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
