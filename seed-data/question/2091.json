{"Body":"<p>This is kind of a specific question, though it appears there is no StackExchange forum for the Korean language...</p>\n\n<p>What are the specific rules in Yale Romanization of Korean with regard to where to put explicit syllable breaks? Wikipedia describes it as \"in cases of letter combinations that would otherwise be ambiguous\". But wouldn't a majority of syllable boundaries in romanized Korean be potentially ambiguous? E.g. nearly any consonant or pair of consonants between vowel clusters, between plausible digraphs, etc.? </p>\n\n<p>Looking at the output from <a href=\"http://ling.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~asaokitan/tools/hangul_yale_converter.cgi.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ling.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~asaokitan/tools/hangul_yale_converter.cgi.en</a>, it appears to only mark a subset of these cases. It appears to assume that a single intervocalic consonant is the initial consonant of the latter syllable (e.g. solika), and only marks the syllable boundary if that is not the case (e.g. salamtul.i). It also appears to assume that a plausible digraph is indeed a diagraph, and only marks when a syllable boundary splits a plausible digraph (e.g. thaykuk.ki but not nyangi). But it feels like most of those \"rules\" have exceptions, and I don't understand them.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly are the complete set of rules at work here?</p>\n", "Id":"2091", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2094", "Title":"Rules of Yale Romanization of Korean", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.620", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<orthography><transcription><korean><transliteration>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-12T18:14:36.417", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"188", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-14T06:00:01.440", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/JustinOlbrantz", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1097", "AccountId":"1561933", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"470", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.637", "DisplayName":"Justin Olbrantz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:48:30.797"}}
