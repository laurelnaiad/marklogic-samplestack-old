{"Body":"<p>In Indo-European languages, the neuter is often characterized by syncretism between nominative and accusative.</p>\n\n<p>There are other examples of syncretism and also historical change where the nominative pairs with accusative and genitive pairs with dative.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a single name referring to something being nominative OR accusative without a further distinction being made? (Or put another way, <em>not</em> genitive/dative?)</p>\n\n<p>Or put yet another way, if I were tagging a neuter word and wanted to indicate that the case is either nominative or accusative, is there a term for that (other than just saying nom/acc or something)?</p>\n\n<p>If the four cases nominative, accusative, genitive, dative were to be treated as having a relationship:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X\n+---+--- Y\n    |    +--- nominative\n    |    |\n    |    +--- accusative\n    |\n    +--- Z\n         +--- genitive\n         |\n         +--- dative\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is there a name for <code>Y</code> (or <code>Z</code> for that matter)?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: note that I'm particularly interested in labeling the morphological reflex, not the grammatical relation. In other words, I'm not attempting to make any claims about case semantics by this analysis.</p>\n", "Id":"2919", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2923", "Title":"Is there a name for the \"case\" that is a conflation of nominative and accusative?", "CreationDate":"2012-12-01T22:29:03.767", "OwnerUserId":"165", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><cases>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-07T11:44:48.943", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"143", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-07T11:44:48.943", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"45", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jtauber.com", "Id":"165", "AccountId":"39169", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T15:33:39.137", "AboutMe":"Entrepreneur and Pinax Lead Developer; Web Standards and Open Source Guy; Movie Producer and Digital Cinematographer; Composer and Music Theorist; Greek Scholar and Doctoral Student in Linguistics\r\n\r\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"Boston, MA", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"703", "DisplayName":"James Tauber", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-10T14:24:17.283"}}
