{"Body":"<p>I've recently noticed something that I can't explain, a link between German and Sardinian. Two languages that, at least apparently for me, are not supposed to be <em>that</em> linked. Also English is included in this, which is more related to German than it is to Sardinian. Yet there's something I cannot understand. </p>\n\n<p>Let's take the word \"short\". In German it's <em>kurz</em>. I might be way off, but it seems that they do have some connection, <strong><em>k-</em></strong> with <strong><em>sh-</em></strong>, <strong><em>-o-</em></strong> with <strong><em>-u-</em></strong> and <strong><em>-rt</em></strong> with <strong><em>-rz</em></strong>, although my knowledge is not that deep so, like I said, I might be wrong on it.</p>\n\n<p>But the relation seems much closer between German-Sardinian than German-English. In Sardinian, note that I'm speaking about the variant present in the middle of the island which is included in the macro-variant <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logudorese_dialect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Logudorese</a></em><sup>1</sup>, the word for \"short\" is \"curzu\" or \"curza\" according to the genre of the noun it refers to (e.g. <em>un'istrada curza</em> = a short street).</p>\n\n<p>So, how could it be explained that we have \"short/kurz\" and \"kurz/curzu\"? Is there something I'm missing?</p>\n\n<p>For what it's worth, in Italian we do have \"corto\", but I'm not sure what role it might have in this.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1: Although my dialect is included in it, they are slightly different. For the purpose of the question I think we can ignore this difference, unless the answerers have reasons to think differently in order to answer the question.</sup></p>\n", "Id":"2850", "Title":"Explaining the relationship between \"short\", \"kurz\" and \"curzu\"", "CreationDate":"2012-11-15T11:07:59.977", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"111", "Tags":"<romance-languages><germanic-languages>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"184", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-12T18:11:22.317", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"13", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
