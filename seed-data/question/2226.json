{"Body":"<p>What ways do we have of measure the mutual intelligibility of two given languages?\nIt's easy enough to realise if there is a degree of mutual intelligibility between your own language variety and another, but what methods do we have to measure it between two specific languages that we don't necessarily speak ourselves?</p>\n\n<p>For example, Standard Ukrainian and Standard Belarusian are said to have a degree of mutual intelligibility and Standard Ukrainian and Standard Russian are also partially mutually intelligibility (but not as much as Ukrainian - Belarusian). So how can we measure the differentness between Ukrainian and Belarusian, and the differentness between Ukrainian and Russian - thus showing which of the two, Belarusian or Russian, is most similar to Ukrainian?</p>\n", "Id":"2226", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2691", "Title":"How can mutual intelligibility be measured?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-09T12:00:39.810", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<language-families><mutual-intelligibility>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"783", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"400", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-13T01:59:24.157", "Score":"11", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://None", "Id":"783", "AccountId":"1263184", "CreationDate":"2012-02-20T12:40:45.587", "AboutMe":"<p>English Language graduate.</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"Wales", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"1036", "DisplayName":"Danger Fourpence", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T19:41:06.517"}}
