{"Body":"<p>I'm aware that a number of classifer languages have what might be called \"plural classifiers\" which -- unlike \"normal\" classifier -- force a plural, count interpretation, instead of being ambiguous between a single interpretation with a mass-y quantification. That is, in the general case, we see things like:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bengali</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Onek-Ta rasta  \nmany-Cl road   \n\"a lot of road\" or \"many roads\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Mandarin</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>nei-ge  ren  \nthat-Cl person  \n\"that person\" or \"those people\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, there are also \"plural\" classifiers for these languages that disambiguate, such as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bengali</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Onek-gulo rasta  \nmany-Cl.PL road  \n\"many roads\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Mandarin</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>nei -xie   ren  \nthat-Cl.PL person  \n\"those people\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Cool. But, I also know that Bengali and Mandarin both disallow the \"plural\" classifier with numerals (and I think other weak quantifiers), so</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bengali</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*tin-gulo rasta\ntin  -Ta rasta\nthree-Cl road\n\"three roads\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Mandarin</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*san-xie ren\nsan  -ge ren\nthree-Cl person  \n\"three people\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Are you familiar with a classifier language that has a \"plural\" classifier? If so, does it only occur on things that aren't numerals?</p>\n\n<p>I'm aware of languages in which numerals co-occur with the stem of the noun and not the plural form (<strong>cf.</strong> Finnish <em>kissat</em> \"cats\" vs. <em>kolme kissaa</em> \"three cats\"), but this is obviously parameterized since in English we say \"three cats\", not \"*three cat\".</p>\n\n<p>The reason why I ask this is I've been concerned about the fact that all(?) classifier languages seem to place a classifier with the word \"one\", so you get Mandarin Chinese:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*yi ren\nyi-ge ren\none-Cl person\n\"a/one person\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Yet, there's no \"plural\" marker that occurs with the numeral \"one\" in languages that have a morphological singular/plural distinction. This should be surprising on the Doetjes/Borer-type story in which classifiers and number markers are all but the same thing, just morphophonemicized differently. Hence, I'm curious if the lack of co-occurrence with plural classifiers with numerals is a universal, or if that is parameterized in the same way as the Finnish/English distinction.</p>\n", "Id":"859", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Are there languages in which plural classifiers co-occur with numerals?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-20T14:31:14.203", "OwnerUserId":"438", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><grammatical-number><countability><classifiers><plurality>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-11T14:37:08.523", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"265", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-12T18:40:44.037", "Score":"13", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ohhai.mn", "Id":"438", "AccountId":"985599", "CreationDate":"2011-10-19T23:00:39.300", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Maryland, studying Linguistics.
