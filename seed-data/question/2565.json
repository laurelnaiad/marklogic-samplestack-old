{"Body":"<p>In his excellent work, <a href=\"http://archive.org/stream/cu31924026632947#page/n5/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">Negation in English and Other Languages</a> (1917), Otto Jespersen has discovered a pattern that describes how linguistic <strong>negation</strong> shifts between several stages:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Negation is expressed by a single negative marker (<strong>NEG1</strong>);</li>\n<li>Negation is expressed by <strong>NEG1</strong> in a combination with a negative adverb or noun phrase (<strong>NEG2</strong>);</li>\n<li><strong>NEG2</strong> takes on the function of expressing negation by itself; <strong>NEG1</strong> becomes optional;</li>\n<li><strong>NEG1</strong> becomes extinct and <strong>NEG2</strong> expresses negation on its own.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, I'm confused with its name. To me, <em>a cycle</em> is something that repeats over and over. As far as I understood, there's <strong>no evidence of more than a single iteration</strong> here. It seems that only certain languages (including English) have completed their first iteration, and the others (a majority) have not yet even completed their first iteration.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, the question: <strong>why they called it a cycle</strong>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPD</strong>, thanks to Gaston Ümlaut: The term itself has been suggested by Östen Dahl in his work \"<em>Typology of Sentence Negation</em>\" (1979).</p>\n", "Id":"2565", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2567", "Title":"Jespersen's Cycle - why is it defined cycle?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-16T20:29:10.160", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<negation>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-17T13:22:08.857", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "ViewCount":"298", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-17T13:22:08.857", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
