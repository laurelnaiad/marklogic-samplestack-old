{"Body":"<p>I am currently analysing a poem, and I have come across two sentences that are obviously grammatically incorrect, but I can't figure out how to describe what is wrong with them. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>\"Beside him, the greyheaded man has let one arm slide awkwardly over his shoulder, is talking and pointing at whatever it is.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Where mountains are clouds, lightning, but no rain.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>They're from the poem \"Utah\" by Anne Stevenson. </p>\n\n<p>Like I said, they're obviously syntactically incorrect, but I'm rubbish at describing grammar! If anyone could point me in the right direction I would be very grateful! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is for an assignment, yes, but by no means mandatory. Also, I'm not expecting a straight out \"sentence a is wrong because there is no x\", but I have never been taught to describe grammar, so I find myself floundering a bit.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to intuitions, yes, I do have some, but my failures lie in how to describe them! I would say that both sentences are questions of ellipsis, but that is not really syntactical but rather cohesion.</p>\n\n<p>For sentence 1 the problem clearly lies with the add-on clause \"[...]is talking and pointing [...]\". I would say that perhaps there are two verb phrases attached to a single noun phrase without the proper conjunction?</p>\n\n<p>For sentence 2, I would say much the same. A missing conjunction, or verb phrase (?), but again, that depends on how you read the sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Also, thank you for the welcome! I'm not quite sure how I should explain the context? I am personally looking at the ambiguity in the poem, and in relation to that I am discussing the ambiguity that the syntax produces. I also just realised that perhaps this is too \"grammar-oriented\" to fit onto this forum, so my apologies if so!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> In response to StoneyB - thank you for your input, it was enlightening! I was just wondering what your take on alternative 'corrections' were, so e.g. \"the greyheaded man [who] has let one arm slide awkwardly over his shoulder, is talking and pointing at whatever it is\" or \"In the distance, where mountains are [are] clouds, lightning, but no rain\". </p>\n", "Id":"3334", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3337", "Title":"What is syntactically wrong with these sentences?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:33:24.770", "OwnerUserId":"1837", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><grammar><analysis>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-08T21:15:04.483", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
