{"Body":"<p>I know that an intransitive verb accepts only one argument, i.e., the subject. So, such verbs do not need a complement. But how could one understand the concept of an intransitive complementizer, in Chomskyan syntax? After all, isn’t the very nature of complementizers to accept a complement?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: According to <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/052154274X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrew Radford</a>, \"none of the English finite complementisers (e.g. <em>if</em>, <em>that</em>, <s><em>that</em></s> and the null finite complementiser &#8709; found in main clauses) are transitive\".  So, in what sense is the complementizer <em>that</em>, for example, intransitive? How does it differ from other complementizers that could be classified as transitive in other languages?</p>\n", "Id":"14", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"689", "Title":"What is the difference between transitive and intransitive finite complementizers?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:41:47.493", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-14T10:25:01.317", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"506", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-04T13:43:06.950", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"11", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
