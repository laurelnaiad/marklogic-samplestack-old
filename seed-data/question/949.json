{"Body":"<p>Once I heard from someone that your mother tongue is the language you talk in your thoughts. I've asked many people to verify the correctness of this proposition and to me, inductively this seems to be true. However, I can't deductively claim it, since I have no reference to be made.</p>\n\n<p>I personally know 4 languages (Persian, Kurdish, English, and reading and listening of French). However, I think in Persian.</p>\n\n<p>I just wonder, can we change our mother tongue? In other words, if we accept the above-mentioned theory for specifying mother-tongue, can we change the language in which we think? I know that I can do it deliberately, and many times I do think in English, but only when I'm conscious, and this tires me out.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'd like to arrive to the point where I can think in English spontaneously. Is it possible? How? What are the techniques?</p>\n", "Id":"949", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Is it possible to change your mother-tongue by thinking in another language?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T07:42:09.207", "OwnerUserId":"141", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><psycholinguistics><native-language>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-08T14:45:34.250", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1874", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-08T14:45:34.250", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"28", "WebsiteUrl":"http://nefcanto.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0DNFU.jpg", "Id":"141", "AccountId":"429080", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T10:02:38.127", "AboutMe":"<p>Enthusiast in computer, music, language, philosophy, mathematics, and physics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/89cbd3c64c8e454496e77db95e6d5c03\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/89cbd3c64c8e454496e77db95e6d5c03.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Saeed on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Saeed on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n", "Age":"32", "Location":"Tehran, Iran", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"283", "DisplayName":"Saeed Neamati", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T13:29:16.983"}}
