{"Body":"<p>As is the case in many households, my wife and I are both fluent in two languages  to the degree that we speak to each other without a conscious thought as to which language we are using.  We often alternate multiple times between languages in a single sentence. </p>\n\n<p>I had never paid much attention to it before, but I began to wonder how we choose the language to express a given word, phrase or sentence.  My first hypothesis was that we might be subconsciously choosing the language with the least syllables in order to economize speech, but my observations did not bear this out.  Does anyone have other ideas or an answer based on research?</p>\n", "Id":"3141", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3143", "Title":"In multilingual dialogues, which factors determine the language the speaker chooses for a given word or phrase?", "CreationDate":"2013-01-29T06:17:27.953", "OwnerUserId":"1712", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><code-switching>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-29T14:23:57.320", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
