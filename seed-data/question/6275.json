{"Body":"<p>I'm not a linguist so forgive my misuse of terminology... I'm looking for a data structure to represent dictionary entries. A dictionary would have words translated to other languages along with links to other words (synonyms and such), definitions, examples, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Wordnet structure looks pretty good, but I'm trying to compare it to alternatives. How would one combine multiple wordnets in a single dictionary? Perhaps each word within synset must me linked to its translation in another synset rather than linking synsets together.</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any suggestions. Are there any real life examples on how other dictionaries do it?</p>\n\n<p>Here is for example how Wordnet looks like in xml (nouns file):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;synset id=\"n04779053\" type=\"n\"&gt;\n&lt;lex_filenum&gt;07&lt;/lex_filenum&gt;\n&lt;word lex_id=\"1\"&gt;agreeableness&lt;/word&gt;\n&lt;word lex_id=\"0\"&gt;amenity&lt;/word&gt;\n&lt;pointer refs=\"n04778630\"&gt;Hypernym&lt;/pointer&gt;\n&lt;pointer refs=\"a00089051\" source=\"1\" target=\"1\"&gt;Derivationally related form&lt;/pointer&gt;\n&lt;pointer refs=\"n04779895\" source=\"1\" target=\"1\"&gt;Antonym&lt;/pointer&gt;\n&lt;def&gt;pleasantness resulting from agreeable conditions&lt;/def&gt;\n&lt;example&gt;a well trained staff saw to the agreeableness of our accommodations&lt;/example&gt;\n&lt;example&gt;he discovered the amenities of reading at an early age&lt;/example&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>source: <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/WordNet-XML/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/WordNet-XML/</a></p>\n", "Id":"6275", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6277", "Title":"What is a good way to represent data in a multilingual dictionary?
