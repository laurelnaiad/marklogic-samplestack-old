{"Body":"<p>The rules for when whitespace is required/permitted in Korean are not obvious, but are not explicitly discussed in any grammars or textbooks I have access to.</p>\n\n<p>I can infer this much:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Between classifier words and their complements (e.g. 한 달)</li>\n<li>After pre-verbal adverbs, sentential adverbs and conjunctions (e.g. 잘 지내세요)</li>\n<li>To separate complete phrases (e.g. 도서관에서 책을 읽어)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>while whitespace is not allowed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>before phrase-final particles (e.g. 저도; 민식만; 시드니까지)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are clearly some additional rules, as it seems that whitespace after the classifier word and before 만 is optional as well: 한 달 만 or 한 달만, but I doubt particles 은/을 can ever be preceded by whitespace.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, 뭐 is always followed by whitespace in my textbook, but just Googling I see matches for both 뭐 했어 as well as 뭐했어.</p>\n\n<p><em>Question 1</em></p>\n\n<p>Are there any other environments in which whitespace is required or optional?
