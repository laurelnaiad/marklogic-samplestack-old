{"Body":"<p>I rebound off a question asked on <a href=\"http://french.stackexchange.com/questions/1211/pourquoi-les-animaux-ont-ils-des-noms-differents-dans-lassiette\">French Language &amp; Usage</a>: in many languages, some designations for animal meats (in its raw, uncooked and uncured form) differ from the live animal's name itself. Examples in various languages include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in English: <em>pig</em> / <em>pork</em></li>\n<li>in French: <em>cabillaud</em> / <em>morue</em></li>\n<li>in Russian: свинья / свинина (a cognate of свинья)</li>\n<li>in Czech: prase / vepřové (a cognate of vepř, meaning barrow)</li>\n<li>in Japanese: 豚 / 豚肉 (lit. pig meat, the interesting part here is that 豚 already includes radicals for both meat and pig which makes the addition of 肉 somewhat redundant)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How universal is this feature? What could have given rise to it, apart from the understandable need to differentiate between the live animal and the meat, which could be achieve by saying, e.g., <em>pig meat</em> instead of <em>pork</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"553", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"571", "Title":"Animals’ names change when we eat them: is that universal?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T07:33:33.693", "OwnerUserId":"37", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-27T16:21:51.760", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
