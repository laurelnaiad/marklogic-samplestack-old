{"Body":"<p>Thank you so much for all the replies. I'm new to this site and trying to find my way around here. I apologize if my question hadn't come across as properly phrased in accordance to policy this of site.</p>\n\n<p>Coming back to my question, the original discussion in class had raised following points</p>\n\n<p>Devanagari and other Indian scripts are losing relevance because - \n1. English is widely used a professional and higher-education language in India \n2. Availability of Devanagari keyboards is dwarfed by English keyboards. Similarly, software and user interfaces released and promoted in India are in English, as is much of the computer education available here. \n3. Low awareness of Devanagari keyboard layouts. \n4. Regional literary scene in almost all Indian language has stagnated while at the same time works written by Indian authors in English are thriving. One of the reason is newer generations find Indian vernaculars irrelevant to there lifestyles, aspiration and experiences. Romanization can be a tool for making vernaculars relevant once again.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to acattle for suggesting more appropriate framing of question, so here you go-</p>\n\n<p>Which languages have adopted or considered adopting the Roman alphabet in place of an existing script? What factors led to their adoption/rejection? What were socio-cultural consequence if Roman alphabets were adopted?</p>\n", "Id":"4799", "ClosedDate":"2013-10-28T11:02:49.790", "LastEditorUserId":"2638", "Title":"Romanization - good or bad?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-27T16:21:07.020", "OwnerUserId":"2638", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<writing-systems>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-29T09:40:33.070", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2638", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8663f7bd8c4f1f736defbe7bb3f9fcd7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3497852", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-10-27T16:21:07.020", "DisplayName":"Vilasita", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-29T10:36:23.627", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"94", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-29T09:40:33.070", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2638", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8663f7bd8c4f1f736defbe7bb3f9fcd7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3497852", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-10-27T16:21:07.020", "DisplayName":"Vilasita", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-29T10:36:23.627", "AboutMe":""}}
