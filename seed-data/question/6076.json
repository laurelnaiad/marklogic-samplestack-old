{"Body":"<p>I'm finding it difficult to figure this out in sentences like the following:</p>\n\n<p>a) I have a job to do.</p>\n\n<p>b) I need you to go.</p>\n\n<p>Surely, \"have\" and \"need\" assign theta-roles to \"a job\" and \"you\" respectively, but since an NP cannot receive multiple theta-roles, how do you explain the fact that both NP's are respectively interpreted as the object and subject of the infinival verbs in these sentences? The theoretical framework is minimalism. Let me know if this question is not clear enough.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n", "Id":"6076", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Theta-role Assignment in Infinitival Clauses", "CreationDate":"2013-12-05T21:42:38.910", "OwnerUserId":"2827", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<relative-clauses><minimalism><theta-role>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-06T02:45:41.340", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"35", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-06T02:45:41.340", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2827", "AccountId":"3689126", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"11", "CreationDate":"2013-12-05T21:42:38.910", "DisplayName":"John", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-06T04:06:05.953"}}
