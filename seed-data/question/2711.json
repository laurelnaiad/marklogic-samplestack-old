{"Body":"<p>I was wondering why Thai word for \"snow\" was sounding similar to Slavic word for \"winter\":</p>\n\n<p>Thai: หิมะ <code>[hì-má]</code> \"snow\"<br>\nUkrainian: зима <code>[ˈzɪ-mə]</code> \"winter\"<br>\nPolish: zima <code>[ˈʑi-ma]</code> \"winter\"</p>\n\n<p>Also, \"Himalaya\" हिमालय <code>[himā-laya]</code> is commonly referred as \"abode of the snow\": हिम <code>[himā]</code> + आलय <code>[ā-laya]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking in M.Vasmer's \"Etymological dictionary of Russian language\", I found that Proto-Slavic <code>*zīmā</code> has derived from A.Greek <code>χεῖμών</code>. Also, Latin word for \"winter\" is <code>hiems</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite it seems evident that Slavic word is originated from PIE, I found no sources to cite. So my question is: is it true that Slavic \"zima\" derived from PIE words for \"snow\"?</p>\n", "Id":"2711", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2716", "Title":"Is Slavic [zima] (\"winter\") derived from \"snow\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-10-19T11:45:13.640", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-06T15:57:55.800", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "ViewCount":"388", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-03T08:31:47.573", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
