Are there extremes, such as languages with almost no compound words?    (The article above describes Chinese as lying near the opposite extreme.) </p>\n", "Id":"3475", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"How much do languages vary when it comes to the prevalence of compound words in their lexicons?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-31T18:48:34.037", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<lexicon><compounds>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-31T19:51:04.227", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
