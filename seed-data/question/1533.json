{"Body":"<p><a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1515/does-piraha-syntax-contradict-the-principles-of-universal-grammar\">A recent question</a> on this site led to some discussion which provoked the following comment by one of our community members:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>UG is \"controversial in the latter interpretation\" only insofar as\n  there are linguists who are sure there must be domain-independent\n  explanations for all the phenomena of language. I've actually never\n  seen an actual domain-independent explanation for any problem explored\n  by generative grammarians. Usually these non-generative linguists\n  either discuss different phenomena entirely or else deal with relevant\n  issues so superficially (e.g. word order) that they don't even engage\n  the key data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the current question I'd like to solicit examples of problems explored by generative grammarians which are considered to rely most heavily on an assumption of FLN (<em>faculté de langage</em>, narrowly defined, i.e. a domain-specific human endowment which permits the learning and computation of natural languages), and for which the correctness of the analysis is generally accepted within the tradition.</p>\n\n<p>If community members can provide good examples, then a worthwhile follow-up question (that I or anyone else could ask) might explore whether there are good candidates for <em>actual, relevant, non-superficial</em>, alternative analyses which do not rely on FLN.</p>\n", "Id":"1533", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Language phenomena suggestive of Universal Grammar", "CreationDate":"2012-03-02T03:21:21.440", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<universal-grammar>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-02T10:40:06.397", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
