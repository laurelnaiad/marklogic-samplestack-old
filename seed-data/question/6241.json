{"Body":"<p>According to what I have studied before, when a person speaks a dialect just \"in the street\" and uses one dialect else \"in the school\", he is a bi-dialectal person. Now, I have been faced with \"diglossia\". I searched and found that in some Arabic countries, for example, high variety of the language is used for important matters such as political events and religious discussions, and a low variety of the language is used for everyday affairs. How I can distinguish bi-dialect and diglossia? </p>\n", "Id":"6241", "ClosedDate":"2013-12-24T11:17:58.443", "Title":"What's the difference between bidialect and diglossia?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-24T04:27:06.333", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2771", "Tags":"<dialects><variation>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"33", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-24T05:10:39.173", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/218fb281c40c6c812de1e012e411feed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2771", "AccountId":"3630628", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2013-11-24T09:02:41.173", "DisplayName":"zahra", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-30T16:13:24.650"}}
