{"Body":"<p>I am currently working on an M.Phil thesis which is focusing on topic modelling 19th century journals.  The journals in question are science, literature and antiquities based.  I have extracted the text using OCR.  I need to build a dictionary of terms with which I can spell check my corpus.  To do this, I need to find a clean scientific corpus or word list that I can build the dictionary from. <em>edit - English language corpus required (sorry for any ambiguity)</em> </p>\n\n<p>I have looked at Archer but it's got a lot of OCR errors / non-textual content in the word list.  I have also looked at The Art Corpus, but it is too modern.  </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas welcome.</p>\n", "Id":"4177", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4183", "Title":"Word list sought based on corpus of 19th century scientific English", "CreationDate":"2013-08-12T21:53:59.303", "OwnerUserId":"2359", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><historical-linguistics><corpora>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-13T10:27:09.663", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"110", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-13T10:27:09.663", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dh-sandbox.tchpc.tcd.ie/2012/clarkee8/blog/", "Id":"2359", "AccountId":"3166725", "CreationDate":"2013-08-12T21:53:59.303", "AboutMe":"<p>Languages &amp; Applied Linguistics, currently studying M.Phil in Digital Humanities in TCD, Thesis: Topic Modelling 19th century Irish journals.</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Dublin, Ireland", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"13", "DisplayName":"Emma C", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-15T07:38:34.093"}}
