{"Body":"<p><strong>Tone languages</strong> use intonation to distinguish words. For example, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonal_language#Mechanics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mandarin Chinese</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>mā</em> with a mid tone means <em>mom</em></p>\n  \n  <p><em>mǎ</em> with a rising tone means <em>horse</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Intonation languages</strong> do not make such distinctions. Intonation is only used to distinguish the meaning of sentences. English</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Berry is coming home tonight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is a statement with falling intonation, but a question with rising intonation.</p>\n\n<p>However, tone languages also use intonation in this way, in addition to its phonemic function of distinguishing words. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_%28linguistics%29#Intonation_in_Mandarin_Chinese\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> says that in Mandarin Chinese</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>tones create fluctuations of pitch around the sentence patterns [...]. Thus the sentence patterns can be thought of as bands whose pitch varies over the course of the sentence, while changes of syllable pitch cause fluctuations within the band.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So tones consist of smaller variations and sentence intonation causes greater variations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Is this a common or universal pattern in tone languages? Are there other ways in which syllable-level tone and sentence-level intonation interact in tone languages?</strong></p>\n", "Id":"4242", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4246", "Title":"How do sentence intonation and (syllable-based) tone interact in tone languages?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-24T10:51:52.023", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><phonetics><tone><intonation>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"210", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-25T14:32:09.910", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
