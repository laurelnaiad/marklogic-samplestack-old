{"Body":"<p>In Greek, the PIE verbal roots *<em>dheh1</em> 'put' or 'do', *<em>Hieh1</em> 'throw', and *<em>deh3</em> 'give' show up with an unexpected -k- in some aorist forms: ἔθηκα, ἧκα, ἔδωκα. In Latin, the reflexes of the first two roots have -k- throughout: <em>facio, iacio</em> (although the present forms are new analogical formations, so it's plausible that this -k- too was once confined to the perfect/aorist). LIV adds some data from other Italic languages (and tentatively from Phrygian) but says the Greek and Italic <em>-k-</em>'s are unrelated (citing two references which I can't access at the moment), which seems odd. What are the theories as to the origin of this <em>-k-</em> or these <em>-k-</em>'s? </p>\n\n<p>Also, are there other IE languages in which these verbs may have once had <em>-k-</em> in the aorist but we can't tell because the resulting forms would be the same with or without it? (For example, if Sanskrit once had an aorist *<em>adhākt</em> it seems plausible that the regular reflex of this, **<em>adhāk</em>, would be analogically reformed as the attested <em>adhāt</em>.)</p>\n", "Id":"4496", "LastEditorUserId":"2411", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4528", "Title":"Origin of *-k- \"extension\" in (aorist of) some IE verbs?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-16T16:36:51.573", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><proto-indo-european><indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-16T19:13:58.667", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"84", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-23T09:04:36.690", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
