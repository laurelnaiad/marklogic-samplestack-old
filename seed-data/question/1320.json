{"Body":"<p>Recently in my work I came across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form\">Backusâ€“Naur Form (BNF)</a>, one way of describing a context-free grammar. Since then, I've been interested in learning how to deconstruct and parse not only computing lanuages but human ones as well. I realize there is a vast body of knowledge out there, but therein lies the problem. I don't know where to begin. To be clear, I'd like to understand the <em>methodology</em> involved in taking an English sentence and determining the subjects, actions, modifiers, etc, but I have no prior experience in this field. Where is a good place to start learning? To keep the question non-subjective, canonical textbooks or pointers to introductory wiki's are encouraged.</p>\n", "Id":"1320", "FavoriteCount":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1327", "Title":"Looking for a good beginners reference to learn computational linguistics", "CreationDate":"2012-01-23T15:15:36.377", "AnswerCount":"4", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><grammar>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"699", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"1015", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-17T15:05:29.830", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"11", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"699", "AccountId":"90604", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"148", "CreationDate":"2012-01-23T15:11:16.483", "DisplayName":"Hooked", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-10T14:37:50.123"}}
