{"Body":"<p>I believe that the meaning of <strong>morpha</strong> is \"form, like, kind\". But where does the <strong>nepo</strong> prefix originate from? I seem to get a lot of terms like 'nepotism' in my searches, but I wonder how purely aquatic hemipterans ('sucking' aquatic 'bugs') derive their name from such a prefix.</p>\n\n<p>I felt it must have something more to do with aquatic/water born habitats than a simply relational 'nepotism' like device. Yet I cannot seem to find a Latin or Greek/other classical term that is similar apart from that in nepotism. And if it does simply define itself as some kind of 'relational' form, then why is it juxtaposed so clearly against gerromorpha? </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the surface dwelling bugs-which appears to connote a geo — or at least semi-earth type sense — this leads me to believe I am searching for a water related latin/greek term — or other origin for this nepo-morpha prefix — can you help? Is there some kind of aquatic classical reference within 'nepo'? </p>\n", "Id":"2984", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "Title":"Specifically in terms of nepomorpha, nepidae and further taxonomic classifications", "CreationDate":"2012-12-18T18:56:47.997", "OwnerUserId":"1595", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><etymology><affixes>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-18T21:11:05.313", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
