{"Body":"<p>I am writing a program that will take input from users in non-English languages (German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese) and will need to determine whether the input is grammatically correct. The majority of the coding will be done in Python, so I would like suggested tools to have a Python interface if possible.</p>\n\n<p>I've found the Python NLTK which contains a grammar module. Their data includes English and Spanish grammars, but I am still in need of the other languages. Any help is greatly appreciated. Also, grammars for other languages are welcome, but the listed ones are the ones I will definitely need.</p>\n", "Id":"3784", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3788", "Title":"Checking grammar of non-English text (NLP)", "CreationDate":"2013-05-30T21:02:36.420", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><nlp><grammar><computer-science>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2118", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"144", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-03T09:07:34.873", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2118", "AccountId":"2838004", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"13", "CreationDate":"2013-05-30T20:59:35.640", "DisplayName":"Alison Kao", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-28T20:22:15.983"}}
