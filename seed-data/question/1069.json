{"Body":"<p>What's the difference between agglutinative and non-agglutinative languages when <em>spoken</em>? According to my understanding, agglutinative languages typically join prefixes and suffixes extensively.</p>\n\n<p>For instance (although I'm probably a bit off here), the word <strong>gizon</strong> in Basque means <em>man</em>, <strong>gizona</strong> means <em>a man</em>; <strong>gizonarekin</strong> means <em>with the man</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the written convention could easily have been perhaps <strong>gizon a</strong> for <em>a man</em> and <strong>gizon arekin</strong> for <em>with the man</em>. It would seem that Basque would no longer be an agglutinative language.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, one could write english (without speaking any differently) with long compound words like <strong>forthecats</strong> or <strong>howmanymen</strong>. Is the difference merely orthographical?</p>\n", "Id":"1069", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1075", "Title":"Is there really a difference between agglutinative and non-agglutinative languages when spoken?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-25T05:51:31.247", "OwnerUserId":"534", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><linguistic-typology><orthography><agglutination>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-27T13:24:01.360", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"553", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-07T19:07:55.410", "Score":"25", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"534", "AccountId":"33415", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"257", "CreationDate":"2011-11-25T05:35:51.900", "DisplayName":"Lucky", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-22T21:23:41.730"}}
