{"Body":"<p>It seems to me (but I may be wrong), that languages tend to evolve towards simplification. Some examples I can think of: loss of declinations in Romance languages or in English, loss of 2nd person specific conjugation in Portuguese (plural in Portugal, singular and plural in Brasil).</p>\n\n<p>One could imagine that such processes continue until a language starts loosing its expressive power.\nBut it seems that languages are not yet all super-simplified. Some complexity is retained to some extent, depending on the language, and even created (for instance, the double negation in French: \"Je ne sais\" -> \"Je ne sais pas\" (which may actually be undergoing a simplification: -> \"Je sais pas\")).\nWhat causes languages to sometimes accept new complex features? Aren't the speakers prone to a natural laziness that should oppose to this?</p>\n\n<p>I suppose my question is highly dependent on what \"complexity\" means.</p>\n", "Id":"2645", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2646", "Title":"Why do languages retain or re-create complexity?", "CreationDate":"2012-10-04T23:31:17.383", "OwnerUserId":"1379", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<evolution>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-04T23:47:43.400", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
