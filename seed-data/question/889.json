{"Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusitanian_language\">Lusitanian language</a> was almost certainly an Indo-European language, but whether or not it was a Celtic language is still uncertain. Some features, as the presence of the initial <em>p-</em> (as in <em>porcom</em> 'pig'), indicate that Lusitanian is more ancient than Proto-Celtic, which had already lost that initial <em>p-</em> by the time of the attested Lusitanian inscriptions. Other features suggest a strong parallel with the Celtic languages, such as the loss of the semivowel [w] > Ø before vowels (<em>*owila > *ovila > *ofila > *ohila > oila</em> 'sheep'), which can also be found in Old Irish (<em>*wir- > *vir- > fir- > ind (f)ir</em> '(the) man').</p>\n\n<p>This uncertainty is of course due to the scarcity of data (just a few inscriptions, toponyms and deity names). What kind of evidence would be necessary to decide what is the exact place of Lusitanian in the Indo-European tree?</p>\n", "Id":"889", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"890", "Title":"What is necessary to decide if Lusitanian is a Celtic language?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-26T00:21:12.273", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><indo-european><celtic>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-29T21:36:36.607", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"672", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-21T06:31:05.983", "Score":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
