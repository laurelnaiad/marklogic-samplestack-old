{"Body":"<p>In some dialects of English (for example: General American), “writer” is said to be pronounced differently from “rider” due to the following two phonological rules (done in this order):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vowels are longer before voiced consonants (than before voiceless consonants)</li>\n<li>Alveolar Tapping: [+alveolar, +plosive] -> [ɾ] / (in certain intervocalic environments)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<pre><code>“writer”: /ɹaɪtɚ/ → /ɹaɪtɚ/ → [ɹaɪɾɚ]\n“rider” : /ɹaɪdɚ/ → /ɹaɪːdɚ/ → [ɹaɪːɾɚ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>For some people, the difference between “writer” and “rider” is not a distinction of vowel length, but of vowel quality.  Either way, my question is more about the presence/absence of a distinction, rather than its specific nature.</em></p>\n\n<p>I agree with this distinction in “writer / rider”, as well as in derived examples such as “writing / riding”, “write on / ride on”, etc.  However, I do not observe any difference in other pairs such as “matter / madder” or “litre / leader”; this even includes other examples with /aɪ/ as the vowel, such as “sighter” and “cider”.  However, I do observe the distinction in “slighter / slider” (which differs from the previous pair only by the presence of /l/ before the vowel).</p>\n\n<p>What’s going on here?  Even if we restrict the question to /aɪt/ vs. /aɪd/, which environments preserve the distinction?</p>\n", "Id":"4103", "Title":"The \"writer / rider\" distinction", "CreationDate":"2013-08-02T13:15:19.647", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2272", "Tags":"<phonology><phonetics><english>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"217", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-05T20:04:13.853", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2272", "AccountId":"3075651", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2013-07-21T22:32:42.640", "DisplayName":"Adil Khan", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-13T21:53:56.323", "AboutMe":""}}
