{"Body":"<p>It is generally accepted that the nominal forms in the Romance languages represent reflexes of the Latin <em>accusative</em> rather than the <em>nominative</em>. (This is even true for those languages that have masculine plurals in <em>-i</em>, which is actually a regular reflex of <em>-os</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm aware of exactly one word in Romanian which is only explicable as a survival of the Latin nominative:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>om</em>: \"man (sg)\" &lt; Latin <em>homo</em></p>\n  \n  <p><em>oameni</em>: \"men (pl)\" &lt; Latin <em>homines</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The hypothetical, unattested Romanian reflex of Latin acc. <em>hominem</em> would be *<em>oamene</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Is there any other similar reflex in other Romance languages that reflects the Latin nominative? Is there evidence for the survival of the Latin nominative into Proto-Romance in any systematic way (outside of the pronouns)?</p>\n", "Id":"167", "LastEditorUserId":"76", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"207", "Title":"Which Romance languages have reflexes of nouns in the Latin nominative?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T12:00:13.240", "OwnerUserId":"91", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><indo-european><latin><romance-languages><romanian>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-05T09:11:24.810", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"35", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/alekstorm", "Id":"76", "AccountId":"411223", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:34:32.303", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Urbana, IL", "DownVotes":"17", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1043", "DisplayName":"Alek Storm", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T07:20:27.393"}, "ViewCount":"474", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-17T11:34:47.900", "Score":"20", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"132", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jsbangs.com", "Id":"91", "AccountId":"5121", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T01:49:40.413", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a degree in Linguistics, but I work as a programmer.
