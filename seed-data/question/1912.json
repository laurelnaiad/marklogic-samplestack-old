{"Body":"<p>Even with the volume of constructed languages that exist, I've never seen formal analysis documenting the successive approaches Esperanto took in an effort to really engage and convert \"early adopters\" to the language.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>By engage, I mean finding users of the language to whom its use would provide value for whatever the reason. </p></li>\n<li><p>By convert, I mean that the potential users of the language after hearing in their native language the value that would apply to them, decide to attempt to learn more about Esperanto.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Guess I ask in part because I assume that the creators of most constructed language focus on the constructed language, not the marketing and development of a community around it. Clearly, there are steps beyond finding \"early adopters\", but without addressing the approaches required to engage/convert \"early adopters\", such steps are meaningless in my opinion; this based on my knowledge of how technology adoption life-cycles work, and more importantly in my opinion, how they are comparable to the adoption life-cycles of constructed languages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did Esperanto find \"early adopters\" for the language?</strong> To be clear, I'm not looking for opinion, but research documenting the successive approaches Esperanto took in an effort to really engage and convert \"early adopters\" to the language, and the effectiveness of those approaches quantitatively. </p>\n", "Id":"1912", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1945", "Title":"How did Esperanto find \"early adopters\" for the language?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-12T03:30:27.810", "OwnerUserId":"256", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><constructed-language><field-linguistics><esperanto>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-15T16:35:54.833", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
