{"Body":"<p>In the course of researching the etymology of the word \"<strong>Australia</strong>\", I was trying to find the Latin words for <strong>north</strong> and <strong>south</strong> (the cardinal directions). I found some websites that translate north as \"<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/septentrionalis\"><strong>Septentrionalis</strong></a>\", but I understand this to refer to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper#Europe\">seven oxen, or what we today call the Big Dipper</a>, as it is in the northern sky. Other websites translate north as \"<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Boreas\"><strong>boreas</strong></a>\" or \"<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aquilo#Latin\"><strong>aquilon</strong></a>\" though I think that the former is actually a Greek wind god and the later is his Roman name.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course in English the words <strong>north</strong>, <strong>south</strong>, <strong>east</strong>, and <strong>west</strong> have no transparent etymologies; they are just words for the directions. But it seems that Latin and Greek had direction words that were derived from other things (gods, stars, oxen, winds). </p>\n\n<p>This line of thought leads to a question: <strong>historically and cross-linguistically, how did terms for the cardinal directions arise?</strong> Or differently stated, <strong>is it the case that the cardinal direction terms are derived from similar processes across different language families</strong>?</p>\n", "Id":"1077", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "FavoriteCount":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1855", "Title":"What are the historical origin of terms for north, south, east and west?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:41:49.043", "OwnerUserId":"536", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><cross-linguistic><etymology><latin><greek>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-25T01:30:54.990", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "ViewCount":"2986", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-30T03:46:34.897", "Score":"14", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
