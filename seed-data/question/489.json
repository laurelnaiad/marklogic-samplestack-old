{"OwnerDisplayName":"Vitaly", "Body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language</a> states that the first three of the following four excerpts are semantically or pragmatically anomalous (to give that term some context, it cites <em>We frightened the cheese</em> as an example of an anomaly):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>President Clinton appeared at the podium accompanied by three senators and Margaret Thatcher. Behind him there stood the senators.<br></li>\n  <li>President Clinton appeared at the podium accompanied by three senators and Margaret Thatcher. Behind him there were the senators.<br></li>\n  <li>President Clinton appeared at the podium accompanied by three senators and Margaret Thatcher. Behind him there was the Vice President.<br></li>\n  <li>President Clinton appeared at the podium accompanied by three senators and Margaret Thatcher. Behind him there stood the Vice President.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It goes to explain that the existential (<em>be</em>) characteristically requires that a definite displaced subject (<em>the senators, the Vice President</em>) be addressee-new and the presentational (<em>stand</em>) occurs more readily with a discourse-new displaced subject.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><s>Are the authors of CGEL correct that the first three examples are pragmatically anomalous in major English dialects?</s> </li>\n<li>Why are the existential and presentational constructions in <em>there</em>-sentences sensitive to addressee-status and discourse-status of the postverbal noun phrase, respectively?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT: Apparently, the sensitivity to definiteness of NP is called <em>definiteness effect</em>, and Google Scholar kindly <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=definiteness+effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">provides tons of papers about it</a>. However, all that linguistick-y stuff is sending my brain into meltdown mode, so it would be great if someone summarised it as an answer, if those papers happen to answer the question.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: As per a request by @Cerberus and two other people who have upvoted his comment, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_clause\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>existential</em></a> here refers to the <em>there be</em> construction, the <em>presentational</em> has some other verb than <em>be</em> (e.g. <em>There remain many problems</em>), the <em>addressee</em> is the one to whom something is addressed, <em>addressee-new</em> stands for something new to the addressee, <em>discourse-new</em> stands for something new to the discourse, <em>addressee-status</em> may be either addressee-old or addressee-new, <em>discourse-status</em> may be either discourse-old or discourse-new, and a <em>displaced subject</em> is “the phrase that corresponds to the subject of the syntactically more basic construction” (<em>A Student's Introduction to English Grammar</em> by Huddleston, Pullum).</p>\n", "Id":"489", "LastEditorUserId":"263", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"609", "Title":"Why are certain there-sentences infelicitous in English?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T13:18:10.810", "OwnerUserId":"263", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><english><pragmatics>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-24T14:51:49.607", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "WebsiteUrl":"http://english.stackexchange.com/users/3286/", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"263", "AccountId":"337279", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"243", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T05:27:42.467", "DisplayName":"Vitaly", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-31T15:20:00.057", "AboutMe":"<p>I declare myself to be operating by <a href=\"http://www.sl4.org/crocker.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crocker's rules</a>.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"870", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-29T12:37:01.440", "Score":"28", "CommentCount":"20", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "WebsiteUrl":"http://english.stackexchange.com/users/3286/", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"263", "AccountId":"337279", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"243", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T05:27:42.467", "DisplayName":"Vitaly", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-31T15:20:00.057", "AboutMe":"<p>I declare myself to be operating by <a href=\"http://www.sl4.org/crocker.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crocker's rules</a>.</p>\n"}}
