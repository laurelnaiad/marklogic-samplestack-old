{"Body":"<p>What word is valid across the largest number of different languages, and as different part-of-speech?\n(The precise term is <strong>interlingual homographs/heteronyms/polysemes</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>Examples: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>'rate'</em> is both verb, noun and adjective in English, so count that as 3. <em>'rate'</em> is a <a href=\"http://de.thefreedictionary.com/rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">loanword but also a (distinct) noun in German ('instalment')</a>, in French: <a href=\"http://fr.thefreedictionary.com/rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">(noun) 'spleen'</a> and also as verb (present tense of <em>'rater'</em>), and again a loanword in <a href=\"http://no.thefreedictionary.com/rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Norwegian</a>.

I don't care about straight homonyms, for these purposes that all only boils down to 3 distinct meanings (noun, verb, adjective) for <em>set</em>. </li>\n<li><strong>Ignore capitalization</strong> (e.g. for German nouns)</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude universal loanwords</strong> like <em>pizza</em> (because it's the same word across languages, not a homograph.)</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude proper nouns</strong> (unless they also have a separate meaning, e.g. 'scotch', 'go dutch'..).</li>\n<li><strong>Include noun-, adjective- and verb-stemming</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Include accents as being significant</strong>, hence <em>plies</em>, <em>pli√©s</em> are both valid in English and French.</li>\n<li><strong>Include colloquial usage, as long as it's common usage.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Words must be 2+ letters</strong> (arbitrarily, to avoid the 'letter 'A' is the name for the letter A, in languages X,Y and Z' definition that Muke quoted. But allowing unusual definitions like <em>wye</em> or <em>cym</em>, as he cited.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A good multi-lingual dictionary for verifying how many languages a word-spelling is legal in is <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">thefreedictionary.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dmoz.org/Reference/Dictionaries/World_Languages/Multilingual/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(<strong>Motivation:</strong> this question arose (legitimately) from a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7062698/data-structure-for-multi-language-dictionary\">SO question \"Data structure for multi-language dictionary?\"</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>On-topicness:</strong> If anyone quibbles whether this is a <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask\">practical, answerable question based on actual problems that you face</a>, see preceding Motivation remark; also I wanted to ask this on <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/2761/natural-language-processing-and-computational-linguistics-nlp-cl\">NLP/CL, but that's sadly closed</a>, and non-English questions are offtopic for <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com\">EL&amp;U</a>, and this is probably neither on-topic nor well-suited to the general StackOverflow audience.
