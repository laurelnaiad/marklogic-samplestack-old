To a layperson, this name bears an interesting resemblance to <em>Angles</em>, the name of another (Germanic) tribe that lived in the continent. Coincidentally, the Angles later invaded Britain along with the Saxons, and the name <em>Anglaland</em> (England) was coined.</p>\n\n<p>Is it just a pure coincidence of names or do they both derive from a more ancient, Indo-European source?</p>\n", "Id":"1531", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1541", "Title":"Deceangli and Angles: are these two tribe names etymologically related?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-01T20:16:42.890", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><indo-european>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"22", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"207", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-01T09:52:28.870", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
