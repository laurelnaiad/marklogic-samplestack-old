{"Body":"<p>I've always had trouble with the distinction between the \"e\"-like vowels in European languages: <code>/e/</code> vs <code>/ɛ/</code>. But pronouncing them the same has never caused me any problems.</p>\n\n<p>In fact I don't even know whether my English \"short e\" is <code>/e/</code> vs <code>/ɛ/</code>. I seem to recall it varies by English variety, even for IPA use (I always use <code>/e/</code> for English IPA). In my idiolect there may even be some kind of merger. \"Head\" is <code>/hEd/</code> and \"haired\" is <code>/hEːd/</code> where <code>E</code> could be either <code>e</code> or <code>ɛ</code> - I'm not sure.</p>\n\n<p>So now I'm in Korea trying to improve my Korean. Up until now I had always pronounced \"ㅐ\" as <code>/æ/</code> and \"ㅔ\" as whatever my English \"short e\" is.</p>\n\n<p>But lately people have been correcting me and telling me \"ㅐ\" should be what to me sounds like \"short e\".</p>\n\n<p>Having done some reading I find Korean doesn't have <code>/æ/</code> as I'd thought, but has two contrasting vowels that would both fall into the \"short e\" category for my idiolect:</p>\n\n<p>\"ㅐ\" is <code>/ɛ/</code> and \"ㅔ\" is <code>/e/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>How can I learn to distinguish these sounds correctly, both for listening and speaking?</p>\n\n<p>If I learn it for Korean it will also help for my linguistics generally.</p>\n\n<p>Are there some minimal pairs in Korean I can practice with with my native Korean speaking friends here? (It's not easy trying to explain to non-linguists with imperfect English what minimal pairs are.)</p>\n", "Id":"2619", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"How to distinguish Korean \"ㅔ\" /e/ and \"ㅐ\" /ɛ/?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-25T04:49:02.337", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<pronunciation><vowels><korean><minimal-pairs>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-25T05:03:31.730", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1527", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-29T10:46:08.380", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
