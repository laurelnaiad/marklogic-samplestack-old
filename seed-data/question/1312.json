{"Body":"<p>Formerly as I remember I saw somewhere *dhvor- (door, gate, yard, court) connected with the root *vert- (turn) in PIE. This is quite realistic and can be supported with similar Russian words <em>створка</em> (<em>stvorka</em>) meaning leaf of a door or a gate or a small door, and <em>затвор</em> (<em>zatvor</em>) (gate, lock), both originating from PIE *vert-.</p>\n\n<p>But Starostin links *dhvor- to Eurasiatic *durV (Kartvelian: *dur-, Dravidian: *tūr-) meaning \"hole\". This is quite strange given the difference in meaning and also that *durV strikingly resembles Russian <em>дыра</em> (<em>dyra</em>) also meaning \"hole\". Vasmer links Russian <em>дыра</em> with Lithuanian duríù, dùriau, dùrti (stab, make hole) but further etymology is uncertain. It is quite natural to suggest that this word is connected to Eurasiatic *durV instead of idea that *durV is connected to *dhvor-.</p>\n", "Id":"1312", "Title":"Origin of *dhvor-", "CreationDate":"2012-01-22T06:19:31.783", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"624", "Tags":"<etymology><comparative-linguistics><proto-indo-european>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"171", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-01T08:26:37.627", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
