{"Body":"<p>I am wondering if there are any verbs/phrases that qualify <em>both</em> as ditransitive, <em>and</em> as atelic. The following shows the relevant tests. The satisfying verb/phrase should have the same * patterns as <em>give</em> w.r.t. ditransitivity, but * patterns with <em>sleep</em> and <em>watch</em> in the telicity tests. A complete answer will provide the evidence that the proposed word passes the test in these ways.</p>\n\n<p>(*'s in the below indicate low acceptability. Note that the absence of a phrase must be interpreted as the absence of <em>any</em> inferrable phrase--adding a phrase silently will increase acceptability, but this should be avoided in order to understand the judgments. It is also intended that a difference in transitivity not change the meaning of the verb, so sometimes a * might indicate that example is not interpretable in the same way as the corresponding non-*ed examples.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intransitive</strong>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Al slept. </p>\n  \n  <p>*Al watched.</p>\n  \n  <p>*Al gave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Transitive</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>*Al slept a man.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al watched TV.</p>\n  \n  <p>*Al gave a ring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ditransitive</strong>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>*Al watched Mary TV.</p>\n  \n  <p>*Al watched TV to Mary.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al gave Mary a ring.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al gave a ring to Mary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Single-event compatibility with \"in\"-phrases</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>*Al slept in an hour.</p>\n  \n  <p>*Al watched TV in an hour.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al gave Mary a ring in a year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Single event compatibility with \"for\"-adverbials</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Al slept for an hour.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al watched TV for an hour.</p>\n  \n  <p>*Al gave Mary a ring for a year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Entailment from the progressive to the perfect</strong>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Al is sleeping. => Al has slept.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al is watching TV. => Al has watched TV. </p>\n  \n  <p>Al is giving Mary a ring. !=> Al has given Mary a ring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Single-event compatibility with \"a lot\"</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Al slept a lot last night.</p>\n  \n  <p>Al watched TV a lot last night.</p>\n  \n  <p>*Al gave Mary a ring a lot last night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"3825", "LastEditorUserId":"178", "Title":"Are there any atelic ditransitive verbs (or verb phrases)?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-07T22:15:30.533", "OwnerUserId":"178", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><semantics><verbs><aspect><aktionsart>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-08T16:18:07.210", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"138", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-08T16:18:07.210", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}}
