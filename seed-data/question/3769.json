{"Body":"<p>I've read in a number of places (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_pronouns\">Wikipedia</a>) that Proto-Indo-European had first and second-person personal pronouns, but no third-person pronouns. Instead, a system of anaphoric demonstrative pronouns, ancestors of English third-person he/she/it, were used instead.</p>\n\n<p>My question, then, is what methodology can be used to determine whether a set of pronouns are third-person personal pronouns or anaphoric demonstratives?</p>\n", "Id":"3769", "Title":"Personal vs. Demonstrative Pronouns", "CreationDate":"2013-05-25T18:31:14.503", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><pronoun><methodology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"142", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-25T18:31:14.503", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/JustinOlbrantz", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1097", "AccountId":"1561933", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"470", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.637", "DisplayName":"Justin Olbrantz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:48:30.797"}}
