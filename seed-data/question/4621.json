{"Body":"<p>It is known that distances (intervals) between (I could be wrong in the choice of words) \"very bad\", \"bad\", \"not bad\", \"good\", \"very good\" are approximately equal. Such equality of intervals was used to create 5-points scale for Semantic Differential technique (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_differential\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_differential</a>). How to find out such distances between other comparative adjective? For example, between \"very small\", \"small\", \"not large\", \"large\", \"extra large\"?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPD</strong> The citation: \"It was shown by Norman Cliff (1959), that next particular quantifiers to yield approximately equal degrees of intensity: +3 <em>extremely good</em>; +2 <em>quite good</em>; +1 <em>slightly good</em>, 0 <em>equally good and bad or neither</em>; - 1 <em>slightly bad</em>; - 2 <em>quite bad</em>; -3 <em>extremely bad</em>\".</p>\n", "Id":"4621", "LastEditorUserId":"2518", "Title":"How to check the distance beween comparative adjectives?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-05T19:59:55.900", "OwnerUserId":"2518", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<lexical-semantics><adjectives>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-25T01:04:59.733", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2518", "AccountId":"2750121", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"19", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T23:57:28.040", "DisplayName":"drobnbobn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-26T16:02:26.763"}, "ViewCount":"66", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-25T01:04:59.733", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2518", "AccountId":"2750121", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"19", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T23:57:28.040", "DisplayName":"drobnbobn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-26T16:02:26.763"}}
