{"Body":"<p>Although it seems that most languages are used to facilitate communication, some languages seem to have secondary purposes as well. For instance, expatriates of a nation may continue to speak the language of their homeland to preserve a tie to that land (example: Chinese in the United States). Likewise, a language may be used by a group to isolate itself from mainstream society (example: Yiddish in Israel). What other purposes might languages serve?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I am specifically referring to daily-use languages that do facilitate communication, but being used for a secondary purpose as well (as per the examples in the above paragraph). I am not referring to XML!</p>\n", "Id":"2144", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2592", "Title":"Which languages are used for purposes other than facilitating communication?", "CreationDate":"2012-06-19T15:21:53.487", "OwnerUserId":"536", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sociolinguistics><philosophy-of-language>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-19T16:14:29.147", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
