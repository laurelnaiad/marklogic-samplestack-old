{"Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://wals.info/chapter/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">WALS chapter on consonant inventories</a> shows that the distribution of inventory sizes across languages follows a normal curve, with average size inventories (22 ± 3 consonants) being the most frequent. This is approximately the number of consonants that Proto-Indo-European had. Not surprisingly, this is also the category in which most Indo-European languages (at least the ones charted) are classified.</p>\n\n<p>But there are some exceptions. Lithuanian and Irish (Donegal), for example, were put into the \"large\" class (34 or more consonants). What happened to these languages that made them deviate from the most common size and from the size of their ancestor, PIE?</p>\n", "Id":"1377", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1396", "Title":"What caused some IE languages to have consonant inventory sizes different from PIE?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-06T20:35:36.843", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><historical-linguistics><indo-european><consonants>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-10T01:02:20.410", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
