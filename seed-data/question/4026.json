{"Body":"<p>As far as I can tell, the only difference between these two ways of describing classes of words is that 'syntactic categories' actually relies on evidence of use for determining categories, while 'parts of speech' labels can just be applied without any appeal to evidence. There is also the term 'word classes' which appears to be similar, but also used without specification. \nAre they simply used by different sub-disciplines of linguistics? Or are there more specific differences?</p>\n", "Id":"4026", "LastEditorUserId":"64", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4031", "Title":"What's the difference between 'parts of speech' and 'syntactic categories'?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-18T22:57:58.023", "OwnerUserId":"64", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><terminology><word-classes>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-19T04:42:47.067", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"126", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.superlinguo.com", "Id":"64", "AccountId":"900445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:45:12.903", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a PhD in linguistics.
