{"Body":"<p>I posted this question in <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/\">http://math.stackexchange.com/</a> and it was suggested to me that it would be a good idea to submit the question here, too, as there might be more specialists on the matter.</p>\n\n<p>I am an undergraduate student in Mathematics and I would like to continue my postgraduate studies in the harder, more mathematical aspects of Linguistics. Possible areas of interest would include the mathematical aspects of syntax and semantics, as well as computational linguistics, natural language processing, artificial intelligence or machine learning.</p>\n\n<p>As of now, the courses that I have taken have been purely mathematical: real, complex and functional analysis, measure theory, point-set topology, differential equations, group and ring theory, linear algebra. I understand that the analytic courses are not very pertinent in linguistics where data is rarely \"continuous\" or as nicely behaving as the functions studied in analysis. I would like to hear the community's suggestions about courses that should constitute good preparation for postgraduate studies in the aforementioned areas. The courses need not be mathematical. They can be linguistics, statistics, computer science courses or courses from any other discipline that would best prepare me for the task.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: For those that might be interested, I received some answers for this question <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/306874/mathematical-preparation-for-postgraduate-studies-in-linguistics\">here</a>, too.</p>\n", "Id":"3226", "LastEditorUserId":"1777", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3227", "Title":"Mathematical preparation for postgraduate studies in Linguistics", "CreationDate":"2013-02-19T05:13:48.123", "OwnerUserId":"1777", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><nlp><semantics><theoretical-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-21T09:38:01.537", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "WebsiteUrl":"https://chicago.academia.edu/orestxherija", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3KlUG.jpg", "Id":"1777", "AccountId":"2231453", "CreationDate":"2013-02-18T15:37:55.967", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently a 4th (final) year  undergraduate student in the <a href=\"http://www.math.uchicago.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Department of Mathematics</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.uchicago.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Chicago</a>.
