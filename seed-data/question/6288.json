{"Body":"<p>I was teaching a linguistics class and I came across this topic \"secondary articulation\". It was the first time for me to hear the term. I had always known that the effect of a preceding or following sound is called \"assimilation\". But in the book I have , both terms seem to be different. I did some research on both terms, but I can't seem to reach a satisfying conclusion. </p>\n\n<p>They say that assimilation involves quality and SA involves just place of articulation. I find that so vague. so, is assimilation the broader term? In other words, is secondary articulation a type of assimilation?</p>\n\n<p>And I also came across the term \"co-articulation\". How is it different?</p>\n", "Id":"6288", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Secondary articulation vs assimilation", "CreationDate":"2014-01-01T04:30:27.370", "OwnerUserId":"2954", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><phonetics><articulation><assimilation>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-01T10:57:03.520", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"34", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-01T10:57:03.520", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2954", "AccountId":"3795363", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"6", "CreationDate":"2014-01-01T04:30:27.370", "DisplayName":"Eman Linguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T04:30:27.370"}}
