As a result, he agreed with the consensus\n  belief that lexical evidence of a genetic relationship becomes\n  virtually undetectable after about 8,000 to 10,000 years of linguistic\n  separation, but suggested that certain sorts of complex morphology may\n  remain stable beyond this time period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've been noticing some similarities between Austronesian and Salishan language families, like:\n1) Pervasive Reduplication,\n2) Weak noun/verb distinction,\n3) Alienable/Inalienable Possession,\n4) Numeral Classifiers,\n5) VSO word order,\n6) Attributive markers, \netc.</p>\n\n<p>Could such theory that complex morphology and syntax, to a limited degree, are preserved intact be used to link these two families? </p>\n", "Id":"2991", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2996", "Title":"Link betwen Austronesian and Salishan families", "CreationDate":"2012-12-20T10:44:43.193", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<theoretical-linguistics>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1601", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"67", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-20T23:46:13.193", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1601", "AccountId":"262132", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"106", "CreationDate":"2012-12-20T03:21:37.733", "DisplayName":"Axen Zhyrkhinsky", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T12:38:01.483"}}
