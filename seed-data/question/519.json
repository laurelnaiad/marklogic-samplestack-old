{"Body":"<p>Nouns like <em>water</em>, <em>mud</em>, <em>furniture</em> in English are odd with plural morphology (adding <em>-s</em>, as in <em>furnitures</em>), with numerals (<em>three furniture(s)</em>), and seem to have their own quantifier (<em>much water</em> but not <em>much boys</em>), and are typically referred to as <strong>mass nouns</strong>. In contrast stand so-called <strong>count nouns</strong> like <em>chair</em>, <em>table</em>, and <em>book</em> (e.g. <em>chairs</em>, <em>three chairs</em>, <em>many chairs</em>). </p>\n\n<p>\"Count nouns\" are easily singular, <em>a chair</em>, or plural, <em>chairs</em>. When a count noun appears without the indefinite article or plural marking in English, the default assumption is that it should be interpreted \"as mass\": <em>There was chair all over the highway</em>. Interestingly, there is no equivalent to <strong>marking mass</strong> as we <strong>mark plural</strong> with <em>-s</em> in English, and not in any other language I'm aware of. I know there are languages that mark singular, plural, all of the dual through paucal markers, etc, and still other languages with the glorious <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~sgrimm/publications/grimm_Sub14.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">inverse number marking</a> systems (a single marker, depending on the lexical root, either means \"plural\" or \"singular\"). But are there any languages that mark a noun as having a <strong>mass interpretation</strong>? Such a marker would result in an odd interpretation when combined with a \"count noun\", and \"mass nouns\" might obligatorily take the mass marker.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It is true that there are languages with morphemes that, when applied to a \"lexically mass\" noun, describe a singular unit of the stuff, or a plurality of units of the stuff. Such data may be used to motivate the idea of a <em>lexical</em> category \"mass\" for nominals. To be more precise about my question: I am wondering if any language has a \"mass marker\" that marks any noun <strong>as</strong> mass, so that when added to a word expressing concepts like <em>boy</em> or <em>chair</em>, the meaning is <em>boy-stuff</em> or <em>chair-stuff</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"519", "LastEditorUserId":"178", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Are there any languages that mark nouns as mass?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-25T22:29:26.040", "OwnerUserId":"178", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><syntax><grammatical-number><semantics><countability>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-01T19:09:12.580", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"376", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-01T19:09:12.580", "Score":"15", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}}
