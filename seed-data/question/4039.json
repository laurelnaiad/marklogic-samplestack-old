{"Body":"<p>A Saudi friend on our sister site, travel.stackexchange.com, was just telling me there is an isolated language in his country called \"Fifa'a\", but that nothing is written about it on the internet as far as he can find.</p>\n\n<p>I also can't find any information on it. But it seems to have some other spellings: Fayfa, Faifa, etc.</p>\n\n<p>He mentioned that some people regard it as a dialect of Arabic but others do not. He tells me it has a similar sound to Arabic but a totally different grammar.</p>\n\n<p>Is Fifa'a a dialect of Arabic?
