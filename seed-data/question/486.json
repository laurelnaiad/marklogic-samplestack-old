Is it about pronunciation, or about syntax, or is it maybe just a false assumption coming from a psychological background due to the fact that the other party knows that you are not an English man/woman.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I asked this question specifically about English, since English is the most widespread language on the earth and tens of different dialects and millions of different idiolects seem to alleviate the problem of \"sounding-foreign\".</p>\n", "Id":"486", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"496", "Title":"What makes a non-native English speaker sound foreign?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-24T12:31:39.207", "OwnerUserId":"141", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><english><accent><language-competence>", "AnswerCount":"7", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-24T16:03:56.403", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1993", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-21T20:41:55.493", "Score":"11", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"28", "WebsiteUrl":"http://nefcanto.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0DNFU.jpg", "Id":"141", "AccountId":"429080", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T10:02:38.127", "AboutMe":"<p>Enthusiast in computer, music, language, philosophy, mathematics, and physics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/89cbd3c64c8e454496e77db95e6d5c03\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/89cbd3c64c8e454496e77db95e6d5c03.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Saeed on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Saeed on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n", "Age":"32", "Location":"Tehran, Iran", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"283", "DisplayName":"Saeed Neamati", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T13:29:16.983"}}
