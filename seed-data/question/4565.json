{"Body":"<p>The following is a quote from a Wikipedia page on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_english\" rel=\"nofollow\">American English phonology</a> and concerns flapping in American English:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The flapping of intervocalic /t/ and /d/ to alveolar tap [ɾ] before unstressed vowels (as in butter, party) and syllabic /l/ (bottle), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (what else, whatever). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ladder/latter, metal/medal, and coating/coding are pronounced the same. For many speakers, this merger is incomplete and does not occur after /aɪ/; these speakers tend to pronounce writer with [ʌɪ] and rider with [aɪ]. This is a form of Canadian raising but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect /aʊ/. In some areas and idiolects, <strong>a phonemic distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant</strong>, e.g., [ˈlæːɾɚ] for \"ladder\" as opposed to [ˈlæɾɚ] for \"latter\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Are there any studies on how many speakers have this vowel lengthening? Or can anyone confirm this based on anecdotal evidence?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It certainly makes sense that speakers might phonologise vowel lengthening before voiced plosives after the voicing distinction in alveolar plosives has been neutralised. But this is the first time I have read such a claim, so I would be glad if somebody can confirm or deny it.</p>\n\n<p>Also see this <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/4103/the-writer-rider-distinction\">previous question on a related topic</a>, where question and answers did not specifically focus on the phonologisation of vowel length.</p>\n", "Id":"4565", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4576", "Title":"Phonological vowel length in American English due to (t-)flapping", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T18:54:02.700", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><phonetics><english><american-english><vowel-length>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-26T20:59:22.373", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"154", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-27T17:09:56.363", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
