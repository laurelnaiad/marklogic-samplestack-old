{"Body":"<p>We have been doing phonemic rules in class, and our professor says to write a \"phonemic rewrite\" of words based on these rules, where these words are written like so \"/_/\". While I understand the concept of phonemes and their representation in the slashes, I dont understand it when words are represented in those slashes or what a phonemic rewrite is. Can someone please elaborate on this? Unfortunately, my textbook does not cover it. </p>\n", "Id":"3782", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"What does a phonemic rewrite mean?", "CreationDate":"2013-05-30T20:22:52.857", "OwnerUserId":"2117", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><terminology><phonemes>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-01T16:20:15.277", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"65", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-01T16:20:15.277", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2117", "AccountId":"2636825", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-05-30T20:22:33.400", "DisplayName":"Merry", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-31T22:15:17.197"}}
