{"Body":"<p>[I've overhauled this question.]   </p>\n\n<p>I guess I'm asking about the semantic differences, if any, between mediopassives and anticausatives.    </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Here's a definition of anticausative verb from definitions.net:   \"anticausative(Adjective)\n(Of an intransitive verb) which shows an action affecting its subject, without indicating the cause\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Examples of verbs that have anticausative readings include \"break,\" \"sink,\" &amp; \"move.\"   For example, consider these sentences:    The window broke.   The ship sank.   The snail moved.   </p>\n\n<p>Contrast the latter with these causative sentences:   Timmy broke the window.   The torpedo sank the ship.   The little boy moved the snail.   </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Here's a definition of mediopassive that I got from the SIL glossary.   \"Mediopassive voice is a passive voice in which the verb has stative meaning, and actor is not expressed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Example (Chichewa Bantu):   In the following example, mediopassive voice is indicated by the suffix -ka:   </p>\n\n<p>mwana wangu wapandi-ka</p>\n\n<p>child my beat -MEDIOPASSIVE</p>\n\n<p>‘My child has been beaten.’\"</p>\n\n<p>I have also heard such constructions as \"The shirt irons easily\" and \"The book reads well\" called mediopassive.    </p>\n", "Id":"3998", "LastEditorUserId":"790", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4022", "Title":"What is the difference between mediopassive VP's and anti-causative VP's?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-13T07:06:45.117", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><lexicon><verb-phrase><mediopassive>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-17T03:38:13.470", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
