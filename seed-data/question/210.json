{"Body":"<p>I am interest in reversal errors in personal pronoun acquisition. My knowledge comes mostly from studies done with English-speaking children, and I was wondering if there is any languages where this effect would not occur or occurs in a fundamentally different way.</p>\n\n<h3>Background: Reversal errors</h3>\n\n<p>The referent of pronouns shifts with conversation roles. For pronouns a child must realize that she needs to reverse the pronouns in order to communicate correctly. A father will refer\nto his daughter as <code>you</code> and himself as <code>me</code>, but the daughter must infer that\nwhen she speaks to her father, he becomes <code>you</code> and she becomes <code>me</code>. If a child imitates what she hears, she will refer to herself as <code>you</code> and to everyone else as <code>me</code> - a reversal error.</p>\n", "Id":"210", "LastEditorUserId":"33", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"216", "Title":"Are there any fundamental differences in personal pronoun acquisition across languages?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T07:54:45.133", "OwnerUserId":"33", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><psycholinguistics><pronoun><reference-request>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-16T09:13:25.347", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"125", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akazna/", "Id":"33", "AccountId":"459207", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:58:42.087", "AboutMe":"<p>From the School of Computer Science and Department of Psychology at McGill University, I marvel at the world through algorithmic lenses.
