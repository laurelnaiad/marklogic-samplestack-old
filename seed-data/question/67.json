{"Body":"<p>I have noticed that in many languages, words for \"no\", negative verb forms, etc. often begin with the sound /n/. Although I understand it is by no means universal, is there any relationship between these sounds in otherwise unrelated languages (e.g. English \"no\", Japanese \"-nai\", and many more), or is it purely coincidental?</p>\n", "Id":"67", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"77", "Title":"Is the seeming relation between the sound /n/ and negativity purely coincidental?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T04:27:43.960", "OwnerUserId":"30", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><linguistic-universals>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-20T15:56:50.863", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}, "ViewCount":"377", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-06T12:42:27.850", "Score":"19", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "WebsiteUrl":"http://rintaun.tumblr.com", "Id":"30", "AccountId":"221520", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:56:36.397", "AboutMe":"<p>I graduated from Ohio University in 2011 with a B.A. in Linguistics with a minor in Japanese.
