{"Body":"<p>Where I grew up (UK) there was a pub called The Drysalters. I always liked this name without having any idea what a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drysalter\" rel=\"nofollow\">drysalter</a> was, or having any association or emotional connection to the pub itself.</p>\n\n<p>I have just heard a BBC Radio 4 programme discussing <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/drysalter/9780224093590\" rel=\"nofollow\">drysalters</a> which said exactly the same thing; that the word is evocative and pleasant to the ear (and ought to be reclaimed - it has fallen out of use).</p>\n\n<p>I know JRR Tolkien famously said <em>cellar door</em> was the most beautiful combination of sounds in English, and this has already been <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/13237/why-do-some-consider-cellar-door-a-beautiful-phrase\">discussed on the English Language &amp; Usage site</a>. This has led me to a potted history of phonoaesthetics on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellar_door\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There seem to be combinations of sounds or words which are pleasant (or unpleasant) to the ear. Although it might sometimes be because of association (Wikipedia has some interesting reasons why the door to the cellar might be evocative), this cannot be the only reason (as in my case with drysalters).</p>\n\n<p>My question is this:</p>\n\n<p>Certain words can find their origins far back in the roots of Indo-European languages, the most obvious one being the <em>ma</em> sound of so many words meaning 'mother'. Is there any traceable reason why phonoaesthetic words are so attractive? Do those particular sounds have their roots deep in the first languages? </p>\n", "Id":"3503", "LastEditorUserId":"783", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Cellar door and Indo-European languages", "CreationDate":"2013-04-08T14:29:04.430", "OwnerUserId":"1941", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<pronunciation><indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"0", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-10T20:34:52.770", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://None", "Id":"783", "AccountId":"1263184", "CreationDate":"2012-02-20T12:40:45.587", "AboutMe":"<p>English Language graduate.</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"Wales", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"1036", "DisplayName":"Danger Fourpence", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T19:41:06.517"}, "ViewCount":"156", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-09T22:28:18.713", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"UK", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1941", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6uP5m.jpg", "AccountId":"2203285", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"126", "CreationDate":"2013-04-08T14:25:07.150", "DisplayName":"Mynamite", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-06T00:27:10.683"}}
