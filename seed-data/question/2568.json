{"Body":"<p>I was studying about LPC (Linear Predictive coding) and in this topic the author was explaining the reasons why LPC is used widely for speech recognition system. One reason he gave was this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The way in which LPC is applied to the analysis of speech signals leads to a reasonable source-vocal tract separation. As a result, a parsimonious representation of the vocal tract characteristics becomes possible</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is parsimonious representation of the vocal tract characteristics?</p>\n", "Id":"2568", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"What does \"parsimonious representation\" mean in the context of speech recognition?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-17T05:59:31.243", "OwnerUserId":"1314", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<speech-recognition>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-17T19:50:32.140", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
