{"Body":"<p>Is there a difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants when whispering, which as I understand it, does not use the vocal cords? I know it sounds silly to ask because we can all understand whispered speech, but I wonder how much is psychological (ie brain-determined using context) and how much is physically different between the sounds? If someone could explain how we differentiate an 's' from a whispered 'z' for instance, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n", "Id":"2340", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Whispered Voiced Consonents", "CreationDate":"2012-08-03T06:17:30.123", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"921", "Tags":"<phonetics><voicing>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"295", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-04T02:41:21.880", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"12", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"921", "AccountId":"426085", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"138", "CreationDate":"2012-04-12T23:41:10.460", "DisplayName":"Double AA", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-25T01:17:20.970"}}
