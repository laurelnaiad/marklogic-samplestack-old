{"Body":"<ol>\n<li><p>How is English \"like\" &mdash; as in \"you look like a monkey\" &mdash; generally analyzed these days?  I can think of two ways to go here. I'm tempted to call it either a preposition, or some sort of funny adverb that necessarily takes a complement, and off the top of my head, both views would have advantages.  And of course, there might be a third possibility I'm not thinking of, or there might be ongoing debate with no emerging consensus....</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there words in other languages that have the semantics of English \"like,\" but that are analyzed as a different part of speech?  For instance, if the consensus is that English \"like\" is a preposition, are there languages where its closest counterpart is an adverb (or a verb, or a relational noun, or...)?  If \"yes\" (and I suspect the answer <em>will</em> be \"yes,\" given how diverse languages are generally), can you give some specific examples?</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"2358", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2706", "Title":"\"Like\" in English (and perhaps other languages)", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T17:02:51.593", "OwnerUserId":"306", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><morphology><reference-request><parts-of-speech><word-classes>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-18T16:44:47.030", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
