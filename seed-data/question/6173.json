{"Body":"<p>What I mean by no diacritics. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Czech has: ř, ů, á, š ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Spanish has: Ñ, á ...</p>\n  \n  <p>German: ä, ö, ü...</p>\n  \n  <p>Italian: è, ò, ...</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At least in Europe, I am not aware of a language that doesn't use diacritics. Of course, except English. </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I also excluded classical Latin, because it's, obviously, <strong>based on</strong> it -> Latin alphabet/letters and it's practically dead language maybe with the exception of Vatican and some Academia, Medicine and Science departments.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: By diacritic I mean this: \ndi·a·crit·ic noun \\ˌdī-ə-ˈkri-tik\\\n: a mark that is placed over, under, or through a letter in some languages to show that the letter should be pronounced in a particular way</p>\n\n<p>Is this true? </p>\n\n<p>What about other languages in the world that use only 26 (or less) Latin characters like English. Are there any? Or is English the only language without any accents?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Maybe you could argue that there is one special \"symbol\"and that is <code>'</code> </p>\n\n<p>e.g. I'm , I've, John's etc. However, these are mostly abbreviations of I am, I have etc. so it is not necessary to use. And John's father could be written like <code>the father of John</code>\nor if you are a historian ;D <code>Johnes father</code></p>\n", "Id":"6173", "LastEditorUserId":"2182", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6177", "Title":"Is English the only language (except classical Latin, Cyrillic, symbol languages and auxiliary languages) that has no diacritic symbols/accents?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-17T07:30:22.147", "OwnerUserId":"2182", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<alphabets>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-19T14:27:43.587", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2182", "AccountId":"1344851", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-06-23T19:29:52.753", "DisplayName":"Derfder", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T20:11:11.777", "AboutMe":"<p>Derfder is my name ;)</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"205", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-19T14:27:43.587", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"17", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2182", "AccountId":"1344851", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-06-23T19:29:52.753", "DisplayName":"Derfder", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T20:11:11.777", "AboutMe":"<p>Derfder is my name ;)</p>\n"}}
