{"Body":"<p>In both Lao cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine there exists a noodle dish with a similar name. Lao <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feu_%28food%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>ເຝີ</code> (feu)</a> and Vietnamese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>phở</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Each Wikipedia article discusses the possibility of the dish/word being related to French <em>pot-au-feu</em> but the articles do not even mention each other.</p>\n\n<p>In looking for other sources you might find the Lao and Vietnamese dishes/words discussed but with no mention of the French.</p>\n\n<p>It seems it is difficult to get to the hard etymological facts, or at least solid likely theories due to such things as folk etymology and nationalism. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3aPho\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wikipedia talk page for the Vietnamese dish</a> has some reasonable debate while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3aFeu_%28food%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">the one for the Lao dish</a> is very unreasonable and nationalist with a mixture of some logical points, some bad linguistics, and some arguments I suspect to be based on misunderstand but don't know enough.)</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese word <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B2%89\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>粉</code></a> may also play a part, via Cantonese.</p>\n\n<p>So what do we actually know about any relationship between these three words?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All of the languages in question have at least one vowel which might be described as being \"like a schwa\". In the case of Lao and Vietnamese there seem to be many interpretations for how to map the sounds in these words into <strong>IPA</strong>. Here are all the variants I have found for the words in question, including comments from Wikipedia talk pages about the tones:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>French</strong> <code>feu</code>:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>/fø/</code> (Wiktionary)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Lao</strong> <code>ເຝີ</code> (feu):  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>/fə̆ː/</code> (SEAlang)</li>\n<li>\"the Lao word, feu, uses a neutral tone\" (Wikipedia talk page for the Lao word)</li>\n<li><code>/fǝ̌ǝ/</code> (found by Googling)</li>\n<li><code>/fɤˆː/</code> (found by Googling)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Vietnamese</strong> <code>phở</code>:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>/fɤ/</code> (SEAlang)</li>\n<li><code>[fəː˧˩˧]</code> (Wikipedia)</li>\n<li>\"the Vietnamese word, pho, uses a rising tone\" (Wikipedia talk page for the Lao word)</li>\n<li><code>/fə̃ː/</code> (found by Googling)</li>\n<li><code>/fɤ̌/</code> (found by Googling)</li>\n<li><code>/fə ̉ː/</code> (found by Googling)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"4583", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What is the etymological relationship between French \"feu\", Lao \"ເຝີ\" (feu), and Vietnamese \"phở\"?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-28T08:53:18.320", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><french><chinese><lao><vietnamese>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-16T13:27:04.930", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"124", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-16T17:15:05.940", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
