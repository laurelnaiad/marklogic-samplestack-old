{"Body":"<p>Most languages with cases seem to be either gaining or losing them diachronically (The Indo-European languages are an example of the latter, and the Uralic languages of the former). Manchu and Xibe (a Manchu dialect spoken by the descendants of a Manchurian guard unit posted away from their kinsmen) have the same number of \"major\" (grammatical?) cases. Specifically, the Manchu dative-locative corresponds to the Xibe locative, the Manchu ablative to the Xibe dative, and the Manchu prolative to the Xibe ablative.  For background, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_language#Manchu_cases\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Wikipedia article on Manchu cases</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How common is this reassignment of case usages without absolute gain or loss?</p>\n", "Id":"588", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "Title":"Case reassignment without change in number of cases", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T19:10:12.233", "OwnerUserId":"341", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><syntax><cases>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-28T23:53:16.870", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
