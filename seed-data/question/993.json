{"Body":"<p>At the English Language and Usage Stackexchange site, the question was asked <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1155/what-is-the-rule-for-adjective-order\">What is the rule for adjective order?</a> and the answer boiled down to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>(article) + number + judgement/attitude + size + age + color + origin + material + purpose + noun</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presumably a similar situation of multiple independent modifiers arises in other languages, too. But is English so special that only it has such a specific ordering? Is it 'anything goes' in other languages, or do they follow a strict pattern but different, or is this pattern universal? Do the patterns that exist share any properties?</p>\n", "Id":"993", "Title":"Are there any other rules for adjective order?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-09T02:57:15.963", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"4", "Tags":"<syntax><cross-linguistic><adjectives>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"369", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-09T17:05:09.780", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"432", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"United States", "Id":"4", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"167219", "Views":"42", "Reputation":"1906", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:24:01.087", "DisplayName":"Mitch", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T11:56:51.610", "AboutMe":"<p>Native speaker of American English (AmE) with touches of Southern AmE.\nProficient in French and German.
