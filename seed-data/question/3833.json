{"Body":"<p>Last night I was thinking about the trill sounds and how most languages I know about have just one, though they vary in which one they have.</p>\n\n<p>Most common seems to be the alveolar trill <code>/r/</code>, as in Italian, Spanish, and many languages.</p>\n\n<p>Then German, depending on the variety, has the uvular trill <code>/ʀ/</code> which I can seldom produce.</p>\n\n<p>The only language I am familiar with that has two contrasting trills is Czech, with an alveolar trill, and its famous/unique fricative trill, <code>ř</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Caveats: Yes there are languages such as German that have two non-contrasting trills, which those sounds being allophones distributed among the varieties, and languages which contrast a trilled \"r\" with one or more other types of \"r\" such as taps/flaps. I'm not concerned with those for this question.</p>\n\n<p>But are there some less well-known languages that have three or more <strong>contrasting</strong> trills?</p>\n", "Id":"3833", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3844", "Title":"Does any language contrast more than two trills?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-09T03:28:59.530", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><consonants><trills>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-09T04:32:43.097", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"123", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-12T00:29:22.830", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
