{"Body":"<p>French has that rule that whenever a masculine entity is part of a group, the whole NP will default to masculine as far as agreement goes. My native language, German, also defaults gender to masculine, whose forms are usually the least marked, though plural may also be analyzed as a separate, fourth gender. However, I wonder how common defaulting mixed-gender groups to masculine is crosslinguistically (especially outside of Standard-Average-European) if there's also e.g. a neuter category.</p>\n", "Id":"1706", "LastEditorUserId":"872", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Gender of mixed groups defaulting to masculine – how common?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-27T12:29:06.460", "OwnerUserId":"872", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic><linguistic-typology><gender><agreement>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-27T13:07:37.910", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Germany", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"872", "AccountId":"1357370", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"41", "CreationDate":"2012-03-27T12:29:06.460", "DisplayName":"Jipí", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-11T19:28:03.560"}, "ViewCount":"506", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-28T10:42:00.117", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Germany", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"872", "AccountId":"1357370", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"41", "CreationDate":"2012-03-27T12:29:06.460", "DisplayName":"Jipí", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-11T19:28:03.560"}}
