{"Body":"<p>In reading Daniel Block's commentary on Ezekiel, I have come across the word <strong>sufformative</strong>. (Block uses it of the Hebrew masculine singular ending <em>-em</em>.) I have searched all around but cannot find a definition. Searching on Google is instructive in that it reveals that the word seems to be used primary in the context of the study of ancient Hebrew and Greek. I have had trouble before finding definitions for words used by Biblical linguists; they seem to have their own set of vocabulary.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, in a general way it indicates some sort of formation at the end of a word. I also have the sense that this is somewhat different than the meaning of <strong>suffix</strong>, though I am not clear enough on the definition of the word to express this difference. What is the meaning of <em>sufformative</em>? Is it different from <em>suffix</em>, and if so, how? Examples (in whatever language) would also be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>(I've chosen to ask this rather than on English.SE because this word seems to be used only by linguists.)</p>\n", "Id":"2884", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2906", "Title":"Meaning of sufformative versus suffix", "CreationDate":"2012-11-23T02:12:13.617", "OwnerUserId":"273", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><terminology>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-01T01:58:13.807", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"186", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-01T01:58:13.807", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "WebsiteUrl":"http://english.stackexchange.com/users/13088/kazark", "Id":"273", "AccountId":"443137", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T20:50:52.200", "AboutMe":"<p>I love language because <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/084231413X\" rel=\"nofollow\">He is not silent</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/443137\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/443137.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Kazark on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Kazark on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>The birthdate I entered is farcical, as I prefer not to identify myself in any way online, but the age is in the ballpark.</sub></p>\n", "Age":"25", "Location":"ho äm", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"204", "DisplayName":"Kazark", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-17T16:14:36.740"}}
