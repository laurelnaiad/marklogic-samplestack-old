{"Body":"<p>I want to know if there is an index or dictionary of sorts that attempts to list and distinguish the prosodic features(?) of English. This seems unlikely to me because of the ambiguity of a single prosodic feature. For instance, a pause in an utterance has a different meaning depending on context. However, I can conceive of a hypothetical study which utilizes a computer program (or many humans) to analyze vast catalogues of spoken English utterances for specific prosodic effects. Does such a list of categorized prosodic effects exist?</p>\n", "Id":"5904", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Is there an index of English prosodic effects?", "CreationDate":"2013-11-14T05:43:19.257", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2125", "Tags":"<english><prosody>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"68", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-07T17:45:56.257", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://littlecarofcollectedknowledge.blogspot.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fpiDC.jpg", "Id":"2125", "AccountId":"2845334", "CreationDate":"2013-06-01T19:37:36.520", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"23", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"11", "DisplayName":"b.t.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T03:39:58.080"}}
