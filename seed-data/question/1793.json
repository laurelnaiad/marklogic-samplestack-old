The problem is that, when the victim only sees the perpetrator for a few seconds, but works with police on creating the software image for a much longer time, the victim remembers the sketch rather than the face of the actual perpetrator and selects people from police lineups accordingly.  </p>\n\n<p>This problem would not exist if natural language were up to the task of describing faces exactly, but apparently it isn’t.   </p>\n\n<p>Have very many studies been done on the difficulties that people have in verbally describing faces and other visual stimuli?</p>\n", "Id":"1793", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1828", "Title":"Have very many studies been done on the difficulties that people have in verbally describing faces and other visual stimuli?", "CreationDate":"2012-04-15T17:50:20.863", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-15T18:49:06.687", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
