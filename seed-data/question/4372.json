{"Body":"<p>After a couple of weeks in Thailand and learning how to say \"I don't want it\" I've just realized the word for \"want\" is very similar to the word for \"want\" in Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>I know the coincidence rate is likely to be high in single syllable words but the fact the languages are so close in proximity and the large Chinese influence throughout the region still makes me wonder if it could be an old borrowing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mandarin Chinese \"要\" (yāo)</li>\n<li>Thai \"เอา\" (ao)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems that the tones are quite different but I believe these tend to change more freely between dialects so I would assume even more freely when borrowing to another tonal language.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>At least going by dictionaries without much language knowledge or context there are a bunch of other words for \"want\" in both languages, but these are the simple ones I've been taught in each. I've looked for the Zhuang equivalent but no luck so far. I have found a Lao cognate though:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lao \"ເອົາ\" (ao)</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"4372", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"5988", "Title":"Could the Mandarin word \"要\" (yāo) and the Thai word \"เอา\" (ao), both meaning \"to want\" be related?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-02T03:36:40.557", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><borrowing><chinese><thai><mandarin>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-06T12:40:55.367", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"188", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-29T02:33:22.200", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
