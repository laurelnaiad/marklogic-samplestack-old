{"Body":"<p>I'm having a hard time determining when an utterance passes the thereby-test and thus can be considered to be an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_utterance\">explicit performative</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An utterance in the first-person singular indicative noncontinuous present is an explicit performative if and only if it yields a true statement when plugged into the following pattern: <em>In saying “I ____” in appropriate circumstances, I thereby ____.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, if an umpire shouts, “You’re out!” then the batter is out. Therefore, given the right circumstances, this is an explicit performative.</p>\n\n<p>The book \"<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0495603953\">Understanding Arguments, An Introduction to Informal Logic</a>\" states that <em>\"I agree with you.\"</em> is not an explicit performative since \"this describes one’s thoughts or beliefs, so, unlike a performative, it can be false\". However, it states that <em>\"I apologize for being late.\"</em> is an explicit performative.</p>\n\n<p>Couldn't one be lying when apologizing? <strong>Where does the distinction lie?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, how far does the notion of 'appropriate circumstances' stretch? I could argue that when a person <em>truly</em> agrees, the statement becomes an explicit performative.</p>\n", "Id":"2917", "FavoriteCount":"0", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2921", "Title":"Why can't agreeing be an explicit performative?", "CreationDate":"2012-12-01T18:53:00.157", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<philosophy-of-language>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1540", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"387", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-12T01:56:10.713", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://whathecode.wordpress.com/", "Id":"1540", "AccountId":"289676", "CreationDate":"2012-12-01T18:23:44.353", "AboutMe":"<p>In 2007 I got my bachelor degree in applied informatics in Belgium.

I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/EN/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands and I graduated in 2012.
