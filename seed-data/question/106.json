{"Body":"<p>I remember in one of my linguistics classes, a rather complex sign language (perhaps in Brazil, if I recall correctly) exists among, I believe, deaf children homeless children/orphans on the street. I believe that researchers, for quite a while, had much trouble figuring it out, but a breakthrough was made when they figured out that the signs we're patterned after the shape of streets on signs such as subway or bus maps.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that is all that I can remember about the subject, and I don't even know how accurate my information is. And so I ask: where is this type of sign language used and what is it's story / what is unique about it?</p>\n", "Id":"106", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"117", "Title":"What Sign Language developed among orphans/homeless children using the environment as a base for the signs?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T12:43:36.527", "OwnerUserId":"30", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sign-languages>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-23T13:08:54.793", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
