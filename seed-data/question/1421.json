{"Body":"<p>Japanese is famous for its very few irregular verbs, but there are some cases where verb-forms are missing and other verbs/adjectives are used instead.</p>\n\n<p>For example, (in standard Japanese) the verb ある \"aru\" (to be/exist) does not have a non-polite negative (which would be あらない \"aranai\") and instead the adjective ない \"nai\" is used. Still, ある is usually considered regular.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Is it just a matter of definition, or is there some reason that ある cannot be considered an irregular verb which has undergone suppletion?</p>\n\n<p>Another example is する \"suru\" (to do), which does not have a potential (can do). In stead, the verb できる \"dekiru\" is used. (する is already irregular, though.)</p>\n", "Id":"1421", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1432", "Title":"Suppletion vs. missing verb forms", "CreationDate":"2012-02-14T03:12:28.420", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<verbs><japanese><suppletion><regular-verbs><conjugation>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"724", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"302", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-16T14:45:58.367", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}}
