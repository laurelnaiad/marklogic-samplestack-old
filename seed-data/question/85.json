{"Body":"<p>It's generally established that Japanese does not have the grammatical category of <em>articles</em> (akin to English \"a/an\" and \"the\").</p>\n\n<p>But as <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/16/do-some-languages-have-articles-besides-the-definite-and-indefinite-articles/70#70\">mentioned in this answer</a>, the concept of <em>articles</em> seems to be something fairly whimsical that came out of classical language grammar, with a much more coherent and broader category of <em>determiners</em> being a more modern approach.</p>\n\n<p>Given this additional breadth of the determiner category can it be said that Japanese has determiners? In the analyses of Japanese I am familiar with I have never seen this. But perhaps this is a difference between traditional grammars used for teaching and modern grammar/syntax theories used by linguistics.</p>\n", "Id":"85", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Does Japanese have determiners?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T08:09:10.223", "AnswerCount":"5", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"51", "Tags":"<japanese><determiners>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"688", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-05T05:22:09.487", "Score":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
