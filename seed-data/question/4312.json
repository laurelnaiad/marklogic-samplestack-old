{"Body":"<p>Are there any natural languages that mark the distinction between cataphoric and anaphoric pronouns?</p>\n\n<p>Just to make sure I got the terms straight, I looked up “cataphora” and its opposite, “anaphora,” at the Summer Institute of Linguistics’ Glossary of Linguistic Terms.    </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Cataphora is the coreference of one expression with another expression which follows it. The following expression provides the information necessary for interpretation of the preceding one.”</p>\n  \n  <p>e.g.  “If you need one, there’s a towel in the top drawer.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsCataphora.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">What is cataphora?</a>   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Anaphora is coreference of one expression with its antecedent. The antecedent provides the information necessary for the expression’s interpretation.”</p>\n  \n  <p>e.g.   “A well-dressed man was speaking; he had a foreign accent.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsAnaphora.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">What is anaphora?</a></p>\n\n<p>My question is, are there any languages that mark this distinction?   For example, are there any languages that have one set of pronouns that is cataphoric and another set of pronouns that is anaphoric?    Another example:   Are there any languages whose pronouns take affixes that mark their reference as cataphoric vs. anaphoric?</p>\n", "Id":"4312", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Are there any natural languages that mark the distinction between cataphoric and anaphoric pronouns?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-29T04:03:05.957", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><morphology><pronoun>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-30T06:14:35.767", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"151", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-30T06:14:35.767", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
