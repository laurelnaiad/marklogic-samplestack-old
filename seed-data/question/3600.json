{"Body":"<p>I'm trying to find a way to automatically convert arbitrary natural language sentences into first-order logic predicates. Although complex, this seems to be feasible to me, through <a href=\"http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/papers/fol2012.pdf\">inverse lambda calculus</a>; one of the biggest downsides of this technique is that it heavily relies on a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), which must be trained to yield the appropriate results.</p>\n\n<p>Are there other known approaches to such conversion at all, or it is a bad idea?</p>\n", "Id":"3600", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3601", "Title":"Automatically Converting Natural Language to First-Order Logic", "CreationDate":"2013-04-22T17:07:53.953", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<nlp>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1987", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"342", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-22T20:43:44.417", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"New York, NY", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1987", "AccountId":"77782", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"128", "CreationDate":"2013-04-22T16:42:41.590", "DisplayName":"ialencar", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-05T23:56:25.843", "Age":"35"}}
