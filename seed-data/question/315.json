{"Body":"<p>Apparently there is a general trend that languages lose morphological marking over time. For example, according to <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/127/languages-that-are-gaining-morphological-distinctions\">this question</a> PIE had 8 noun cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc), Latin 5, Romance 2 or even 1. Doesn't this show that less inflection is more natural?</p>\n\n<p>My question is why the early languages had many morphological distinctions at the first place. I mean, why did the old Proto-Indo-European folks invent 8 different words to call \"a lion\", or dozens of words for \"to eat\", etc. To me, it sounds more natural to call a lion a lion regardless of whether it's nominative or accusative. What analyses have been made about this?</p>\n", "Id":"315", "LastEditorUserId":"153", "FavoriteCount":"10", "AcceptedAnswerId":"318", "Title":"Why did early Indo-European languages seem to be morphologically complex?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T15:33:02.470", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><morphology><language-change><indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"7", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-21T07:11:06.627", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"47", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"153", "AccountId":"871764", "Views":"33", "Reputation":"1445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T03:14:58.320", "DisplayName":"Floating Tone", "LastAccessDate":"2012-05-27T05:07:04.410", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD candidate in linguistics, with diverse interests including phonetics, phonology, morphology, language documentation, historical linguistics and sociolinguistics.
