{"Body":"<p>While reading the wikipedia article on relative clauses, I was puzzled somewhat by a description of a relative clause in English. It asserts that in the relative clause \"that I saw yesterday\", as in '\"he man that I saw yesterday went home\", \"that\" is a complementizer rather than a pronoun, and that there is a gap left after \"saw\" where a pronoun would normally go. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, why wouldn't you say that the relative clause is indicated by word order alone rather than gapping, \"that\" being moved from its usual position after the subject to the head of the phrase? </p>\n\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause#Ways_of_forming_relative_clauses\" rel=\"nofollow\">link to the article</a>.</p>\n", "Id":"5955", "AcceptedAnswerId":"5956", "Title":"Classification of Relative Clauses in English", "CreationDate":"2013-11-21T02:10:08.340", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><english><linguistic-typology>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1901", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"88", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-24T16:20:31.050", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vGq9U.jpg", "Id":"1901", "AccountId":"2550250", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"83", "CreationDate":"2013-03-27T03:41:32.680", "DisplayName":"Kaninchen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:14:44.377", "AboutMe":"<p>Ich kann ziemlich gut Deutsch, oder so glaube ich, 和会说一点中文，可是说的不好。Have never formally studied linguistics.</p>\n"}}
