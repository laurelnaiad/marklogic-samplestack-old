{"Body":"<p>Let's say I have a command line app that has the following functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function createABox() { console.log(\"hey\"); };\nfunction deleteABox() { console.log(\"wutsup\"); };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The command line app can take any kind of text input. I want the app to call createABox whenever it makes sense to do so from an English speaking perspective. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"create a box\", \"create box\", \"new box\", \"I want a new box\", \"new container\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>should all call createABox. Is this a common linguistics problem and if so what would be the pseudocode algorithm for something like that? Thanks.</p>\n", "Id":"4577", "ClosedDate":"2013-10-28T11:03:57.700", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Algorithm for converting an English sentence or phrase into a function call", "CreationDate":"2013-09-27T17:41:51.757", "OwnerUserId":"2519", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><nlp><parsing>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-28T04:51:17.893", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"73", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-28T05:43:54.803", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.electricsignal.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SRcEB.jpg", "Id":"2519", "AccountId":"3363094", "CreationDate":"2013-09-27T17:32:32.910", "AboutMe":"<p>Graduated from Neumann University in Computer Information and Systems Management in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>I've been in web development since 2008, working for small startups to big tech firms.</p>\n", "Age":"28", "Location":"NJ", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"9", "DisplayName":"ElectricSignal", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-27T19:01:51.790"}}
