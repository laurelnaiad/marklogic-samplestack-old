{"Body":"<p>My understanding that 100% accurate parsing (analyzing a text and creating a syntactic tree) is an impossible task for computational linguistics at this moment. However, there are many heuristics or approximation algorithms that produces good enough results. Do we have some kind of metric to rate the effectiveness of these algorithms? How does it work? For example, I guess we can run the algorithm against a set of text whose syntactic tree we already know and then compare the program's output against the known sytactic tree? Or do we use other methods?</p>\n\n<p>Are there already well-established metrics/scoring system to rate parsing? How do they work?</p>\n", "Id":"1873", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Is there a well-established metric to measure the effectiveness of a parsing algorithm?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-04T03:24:57.557", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"92", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><grammar><methodology><parsing>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"150", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-05T08:05:55.673", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
