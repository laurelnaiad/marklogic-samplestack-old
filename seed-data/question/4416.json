{"Body":"<p>I would like to learn a language which has cases which cannot be mistaken for other cases, in pronunciation and writing. Does such a language exist?</p>\n\n<p>For an example of what I want to avoid: The case endings of 'ИЯ' nouns in Russian for genitive, prepositional, nominative plural and dative cases are all the same - 'ИИ'.</p>\n\n<p>So, if a language were to have six cases; Nom, Acc, Gen, Prep, Dat, Inst. Six for singular and six for plural. There would be twelve <strong>unique</strong> case affixes in total.</p>\n\n<p>So, a rule for the sought after language would be, once you learn the one affix for a case, you then know how to decline all nouns in that case. All cases would be <strong>unique</strong> in pronunciation and writing.</p>\n\n<p>Example: 'book' becomes,</p>\n\n<pre><code>      Nom      Acc      Gen      Prep     Dat      Inst\nSing  bookat   bookam   bookem   bookim   bookom   bookum\nPlur  bookati  bookami  bookemi  bookimi  bookomi  bookumi\n</code></pre>\n", "Id":"4416", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Which language(s) has cases which cannot be mistaken for other cases?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-10T13:46:29.640", "OwnerUserId":"2456", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><cases><inflection>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-10T17:52:06.727", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"159", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-11T13:47:34.773", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"14", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2456", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3285450", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"75", "CreationDate":"2013-09-10T13:12:00.787", "DisplayName":"evonya", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-14T16:58:44.600", "AboutMe":"<p>Curious about some aspects of languages.
