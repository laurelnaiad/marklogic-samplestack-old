{"Body":"<p>Forgive me if this isn't right place to ask this kind od question, which I'm aware is not, but at the same time I can't pick any more adequate from the list of SE sites.</p>\n\n<p>Premise is this: Verb [x] in a single specific form - in particular tense, person, number, gender... - is independent lexical unit, independent from the original verb; it has it's own special meaning, and, unlike other verbs, it's invariable.\nPremise is arbitrary and unscientific; I'm going to use it as a literary device.
