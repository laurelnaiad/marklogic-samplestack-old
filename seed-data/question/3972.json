{"Body":"<p>This subject itself is difficult to google, so I apologize beforehand for the hundreds of links I'm sure are hidden somewhere. This question was moved from the philosophy site as they told me that it fits better here.</p>\n\n<p>So, it came with this question: <a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/203684/71839\">Is fewer lines of code always better?</a>, a somewhat subjective question about code (about best practices). Then I thought about it and now I'm really curious about it. I have some questions around this subject itself:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Are there other words that show signs of a sentence that, while syntactically correct and apparently right, can be used to clearly see that a sentence might be logically wrong? Always/never in something that makes me read it slowly and double check about the validity of that sentence.</p></li>\n<li><p>Where/how can these words be used? If it's a definition, for example, <code>always</code> can be used (as long as it doesn't class with other definitions). But people don't normally talk with pure definitions, and there're many cases (in programming at least) that people overuse the words 'always/never',  maybe for laziness or shortness sake. Another example (for programming), 'Global state is evil', which could be reworded as 'Never use global state'.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"3972", "Title":"Can words like 'always' and 'never' be used to determine sentences inherently wrong?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-06T05:32:32.613", "OwnerUserId":"2230", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<discourse-analysis>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"95", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-06T05:32:32.613", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://francisco.io", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xBwfL.jpg", "Id":"2230", "AccountId":"902480", "CreationDate":"2013-07-06T05:28:22.500", "AboutMe":"<p>Just learning for fun and helping other in the way.
