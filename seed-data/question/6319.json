{"Body":"<p>I have a list of 15000 sentences for a new language I wish to learn. I also have the English translation of each of these sentences. Additionally, I have a 30 million word corpus for the new language. I have used this corpus to rank the most common words and phrases from the corpus. By phrase I simply mean groups of consecutive words, as I have not performed any kind of semantic analysis. How might I rank the 15000 sentences in order or most valuable to least valuable, with respect to my desire to learn the language. For example, phrases like: </p>\n\n<p>the, and, bread, I am, where is it, I can't, woke up, even if, on the other hand</p>\n\n<p>are more valuable to a learner than:</p>\n\n<p>Kiwi, wiped out, fertiliser, sediment, live wire, set in stone, house sitting, in a state, out of state, as a matter of fact</p>\n\n<p>and should therefore be learned first.</p>\n\n<p>The language I'm learning is Gaeilge.</p>\n", "Id":"6319", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Ranking sentences", "CreationDate":"2014-01-05T13:20:50.087", "OwnerUserId":"2982", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<corpora><second-lang-acquisition><sentences>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-14T17:49:23.417", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "ViewCount":"108", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T06:14:04.260", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2982", "AccountId":"3812057", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"16", "CreationDate":"2014-01-05T13:20:50.087", "DisplayName":"Dott", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T01:42:59.743"}}
