{"Body":"<p>The Chomsky paradigm states that all languages obey certain laws or conditions which ultimately are a function of the physical properties of the brain. Is there a similar constraint on mathematics? Is it thought that there is universal (the universe being humans) structure of mathematics that is the result of the structure of the human brain? If so, is this the reason that math works so well at predicting observations? In other words, since our rules of mathematics arise from the structure of our brains, and it is the same brains making observations based on mathematics, it makes sense that they'd match? \nMight an alien mind not observe such a good correlation between human mathematics and the results of human experiments?</p>\n", "Id":"6228", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Universal \"grammar\" for mathematics", "CreationDate":"2013-12-22T21:02:33.583", "AnswerCount":"2", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2916", "Tags":"<linguistic-universals>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"154", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-25T15:42:24.977", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8108ebceea23fdec0569d61ae353814d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2916", "AccountId":"1449754", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"126", "CreationDate":"2013-12-22T20:56:59.233", "DisplayName":"Richardbernstein", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-28T03:13:22.173", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a neurologist.</p>\n", "Age":"47"}}
