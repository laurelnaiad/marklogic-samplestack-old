{"Body":"<p>The modern Chinese linguistic recursion system is essentially the same as English. If you have a highly embedded sentence, you can translate it word for word, the embedding is very much the same. In my youth, I believed this was just another datum in favor of Universal Grammar theory, but this is not true. </p>\n\n<p>Everett recently demonstrated that pre-literate languages can lack embedding, it has long been known that Warlpiri does not have recursive structures like multiple embedding at all, and Fred Karlsson in \"<a href=\"http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/ceb5.pdf\">Constraints on multiple center-embedding of clauses</a>\" argues persuasively that the modern European center-recursion system was standardized by Cicero in Roman times, and the rules for recursion spread through the influence of Cicero's writing. So that <em>no languages at all were recursive to begin with</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It seems doubtful to me that this could have reached China until at least the late middle ages, so Chinese recursion is a particularly stringent test of the evolution of recursion in isolation from Cicero, in a culutre literate in ancient times. It is possible that Chinese recursion evolved independently.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the approximate date of the earliest Chinese 2 or more level center-embedded production? (2-level center embedding is a stringent test of Cicero-speak)</li>\n<li>Is it before or after the date of the first translations of western recursive prose to Chinese?</li>\n<li>What is the general pattern of clause embedding in ancient chinese? Does it show multiple embedding of clauses? When?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Although it seems highly unlikely to me, if you have evidence that Chinese recursed first, and Cicero read Chinese, that would be interesting. Bonus points for Sanskrit, although I would guess no mutli-level embedding in ancient Sanskrit (based on ancient Hebrew) and considering the different expertise required, it should probably be a separate question.</p>\n", "Id":"1598", "LastEditorUserId":"810", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"How did Chinese recursion evolve?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-08T13:32:44.360", "OwnerUserId":"810", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<universal-grammar>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-09T04:27:02.797", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"39", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"810", "AccountId":"528458", "CreationDate":"2012-03-03T03:39:07.707", "AboutMe":"<p>Everett is right.
