{"Body":"<p>Are there any languages in which all or almost all verbs take only one argument?   For example, is there a language in which the patient is expressed with an adjunct whose omission results in, say, a mediopassive construction.   So \"The racoon ate <em>patient introducer</em> a pear.\" could have the phrase \"<em>patient introducer</em> racoon\" dropped to yield mediopassive \"The racoon ate,\" meaning roughly \"the racoon was eaten.\"   </p>\n\n<p>Also, if there is a language in which any direct object could be dropped and the deleted object stood for some unspecified patient, would this mean that the verb in question wouldn't have to be transitive, or would it be better to analyze the verb as taking a null object?    </p>\n", "Id":"3326", "Title":"Are there any languages in which all or almost all verbs take only one argument?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T04:15:00.983", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><linguistic-typology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"33", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-08T04:15:00.983", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
