{"OwnerDisplayName":"DaveNay", "Body":"<p>I will freely admit that this question is based in ignorance of languages other than English (well, American). But do other languages have the concept of rhyming? Thinking back to my few Spanish classes in high school 25 years ago, I cannot think of very many words that I would consider to be rhyming. Mostly due to the different verb forms and feminine/masculine noun forms, it seems like it would be difficult to build a coherent sentence the way (my understanding of) the language works. Other languages that are even more complex just seems impossible to me that rhyming occurs easily or frequently.</p>\n", "Id":"2260", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Is rhyming a uniquely English language construct?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-16T20:29:00.590", "OwnerUserId":"1196", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><american-english><rhyming>", "AnswerCount":"7", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-25T11:39:16.163", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1503", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-25T22:16:46.430", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"11", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1196", "AccountId":"63822", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"117", "CreationDate":"2012-07-16T23:05:01.987", "DisplayName":"DaveNay", "LastAccessDate":"2012-07-26T15:51:23.593"}}
