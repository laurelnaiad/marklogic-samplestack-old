{"Body":"<p>Japanese and Korean have strikingly similar grammars but whether they are related or not is an open question.</p>\n\n<p>Both languages have a particle to mark the grammatical subject of a sentence and in fact it is pronounced the same (within the phonetics of each language), that being \"ga\" (Japanese \"が\", Korean \"가\").</p>\n\n<p>Is there evidence for or against these particles being genetically related, or related via borrowing, or any other kind of influence? Or is it believed the similarity is in fact purely coincidental? What is known of the etymology of each particle?</p>\n\n<p>(The Korean particle actually has two forms, the one being discussed is used before consonants and \"이\" (i) is used before vowels, the latter has no obvious similarity to a Japanese particle I am aware of but this may or may not be otherwise relevant.)</p>\n", "Id":"41", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Are the Japanese and Korean subject particles known to be related in any way, including by Sprachbund?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:21:05.133", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><cross-linguistic><japanese><korean><particles>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-09T11:14:16.150", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"515", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-09T11:14:16.150", "Score":"15", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
