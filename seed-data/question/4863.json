{"Body":"<p>I'm only really familiar with English and a few European languages, so to my mind it is normal for a language to have a double object construction and/or an NP-PP construction, as in</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>John gave [Mary] [a book]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>John gave [a book] [to Mary]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>English (and as far as I know a few others like German maybe) also have a limited \"tritransitive\" construction, where verbs like \"bet\" or \"fine\" can take three objects:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>John bet [Mary] [five bucks] [that she couldn't spit further than him]</p>\n  \n  <p>John fined [Mary] [fifty dollars] [for cycling on the sidewalk]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe that's a little controversial. Anyhow, is it \"normal\" for languages to have either of these constructions? Also, is the restriction on so-called \"tritransitives\" equally as restricted to monetary terms as it is in English?</p>\n", "Id":"4863", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"Are ditransitives (or tritransitives?) cross-linguistically attested?", "CreationDate":"2013-11-07T12:26:58.520", "AnswerCount":"2", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2695", "Tags":"<syntax><linguistic-typology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"130", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-09T17:02:36.007", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f011b6553d01bbfc2343edb7f44b4a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2695", "AccountId":"3549586", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"31", "CreationDate":"2013-11-07T12:26:58.520", "DisplayName":"Dave", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-21T09:10:59.863"}}
