{"Body":"<p>Consonant mutations are a strong characteristic of the Celtic languages. An example in Breton would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Khaz</em> <code>/kaz/</code>: cat<br>\n  <em>Ar c'haz</em> <code>/aʁ.xaz/</code>: the cat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <code>/k/</code> is altered to <code>/x/</code> after a <code>/ʁ/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>According to Wikipedia there are mutations in Russian, but I am not familiar with the process. Are these similar to the Celtic mutations or a completely different thing? Where do the Celtic ones come from? Is it a peculiarity of Celtic languages, or could it be traced back in others, maybe ancient, Indo-European groups?</p>\n", "Id":"9", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1044", "Title":"Are consonant mutations in Indo-European languages specific of the Celtic group?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:19:26.513", "OwnerUserId":"39", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><indo-european><celtic>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-26T14:17:40.113", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"407", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-26T21:02:59.950", "Score":"19", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"73", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Orleans, France", "Id":"39", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"396926", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"425", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:03:08.370", "DisplayName":"Evpok", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T22:22:04.843", "AboutMe":"<p>Fourth year student in Mathematics and Linguistics, particularly in statistical NLP.
