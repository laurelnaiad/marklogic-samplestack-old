{"Body":"<p>Since vowels in human speech are a continuous spectrum rather than a discrete set, many descriptions of languages I’ve seen — not only on Wikipedia — place the vowels of a language as dots in a two-dimensional grid. For example, here is the one for modern Hebrew:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Hebrew_vowel_chart.svg/400px-Hebrew_vowel_chart.svg.png\" alt=\"Vowel chart of modern Hebrew\"></p>\n\n<p>The positions of these dots seem to be pretty precise; in charts for other languages, dots marked with the same IPA characters are nonetheless in slightly different locations. For example, compare the locations of [a] and [i] in the above to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aFrench_vowel_chart.svg\">those in the French one</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/French_vowel_chart.svg/400px-French_vowel_chart.svg.png\" alt=\"Vowel chart of modern French\"></p>\n\n<p>However, as we know, everyone learns as a child to categorise vowels they hear into the phonemes of their native language. This makes it extremely hard for any particular person to hear subtle distinctions such as the one between the Hebrew [i] and the French [i]. It would seem likely that two linguists of different native languages would place the above dots in (slightly) different places when analysing Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we actually know where exactly to place these dots? Is there some form of modern technology that is used to analyse vowels? Is there perhaps a software that can be downloaded which would allow the user to speak a vowel into the microphone and have it rendered on such a diagram?</p>\n", "Id":"137", "LastEditorUserId":"1021", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"140", "Title":"How do linguists place the vowels of a language precisely on the vowel trapezoid?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T19:53:05.890", "OwnerUserId":"50", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><phonetics><vowels><acoustic-analysis>", "AnswerCount":"6", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-26T09:29:03.757", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"176", "WebsiteUrl":"https://launchpad.net/~replicator-snail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KPUcH.png", "Id":"1021", "AccountId":"124682", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T02:34:01.443", "AboutMe":"<p>.
