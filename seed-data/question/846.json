{"Body":"<p>Are there any packages that do much the same thing for audio/speech that the <code>langid</code> component/corpus of NLTK does for written text? The <code>langid</code> corpus/tool makes surprisingly accurate guesses about a language after training on popular trigram counts for a bunch of languages (from a web-scraped corpus), by comparing overlap of the new document with the trigrams for each known language.</p>\n\n<p>I'm guessing that there are two really hard problems here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Developing an audio segmenter/chunker (I expect there are decent solutions out there already for this)</li>\n<li>Collecting a corpus of audio for many different languages</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don't have a whole lot of experience in speech recognition and that whole domain. Is this even feasible, or is speech way too hard to process for this purpose, given the state of voice recognition at this point?</p>\n", "Id":"846", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"848", "Title":"Automatic/Computational Language Detection in Speech", "CreationDate":"2011-10-19T01:34:48.633", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><computational-linguistics><nlp>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"308", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"380", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-19T10:12:00.417", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://henrian.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"308", "AccountId":"186949", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"143", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T16:09:43.487", "DisplayName":"chbrown", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-18T19:34:20.480"}}
