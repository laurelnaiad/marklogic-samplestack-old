{"Body":"<p>Why is it that we need machine translation evaluation? If we have subjective evaluation measures why do we need automatic evaluation? As most of the automatic evaluation metrics are unable to capture linguistic features of languages (Particularly non english, free word order languages).</p>\n\n<p>More over can one or more automatic evaluation metrics capture deeper linguistic errors that MTs most often make. I don't mean to be rude. I don't mean to offend anybody. It is just that I am new to MT and while reading various papers and books have lots and lots of curious queries.</p>\n", "Id":"2246", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"Why do we need machine translation evaluation?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-13T14:09:42.007", "OwnerUserId":"1186", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><word-order><machine-translation>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-13T22:11:20.793", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
