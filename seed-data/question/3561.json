{"Body":"<p>I commonly calculate the precision and recall for information pulled from text but I'm not sure how to calculate the margin of error for those precision and recall values.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, if I have a sample 1,000 given names out of an unknown amount of data.  My goal is to indentify the gender of of each name.  My system does its magic and I am able to determine that I am assigning gender with 90% precision and 90% recall.</p>\n\n<p>How do I calculate the margin of error for the precision and recall given that the values I've calculated are over a sample of data?</p>\n\n<p>I've found a formula for the Maximum Margin of Error on <a href=\"http://www.had2know.com/business/compute-margin-of-error.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.had2know.com/business/compute-margin-of-error.html</a></p>\n\n<p>but this doesn't seem like it would really apply in this kind of situation.</p>\n", "Id":"3561", "LastEditorUserId":"168", "Title":"Calculating margin of error for precision and recall", "CreationDate":"2013-04-16T00:42:04.143", "OwnerUserId":"168", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><nlp>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-16T18:04:48.320", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"168", "AccountId":"867706", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"101", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T17:36:41.253", "DisplayName":"mmoosman", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-27T16:24:21.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a professional computational linguist with a strong background in American Sign Language.</p>\n\n<p>Currently working in Salt Lake City, UT.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"104", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-16T18:04:48.320", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"168", "AccountId":"867706", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"101", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T17:36:41.253", "DisplayName":"mmoosman", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-27T16:24:21.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a professional computational linguist with a strong background in American Sign Language.</p>\n\n<p>Currently working in Salt Lake City, UT.</p>\n"}}
