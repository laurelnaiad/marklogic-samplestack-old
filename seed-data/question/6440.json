{"Body":"<p>Take for example the words 'I' and 'you' (or 'I' and 'we'). Is it more reasonable to analyze them as different lexemes, or as different forms of a same lexeme inflected for grammatical person (or number)?</p>\n\n<p>As pointed out in the comments, it doesn't make much sense to ask what's the <strong>right</strong> view, but what are the advantages and disadvantages of these opposing views? Is any of them more widely adopted in a given context?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Original question:</em></p>\n\n<p>I believe the commonest view is that words like 'I' and 'me' are just different forms of a single lexeme, inflected for grammatical case. But are 'I' and 'you' (or 'I' and 'we') different lexemes or again just different forms of a same lexeme, inflected for grammatical person (or number)?</p>\n\n<p>Insights for languages other than English would also be very welcome.</p>\n", "Id":"6440", "LastEditorUserId":"3042", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Are personal pronouns in English different lexemes or just inflected forms of the same one?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-17T14:40:41.720", "OwnerUserId":"3042", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<inflection><pronoun><lexemes>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-18T17:51:18.693", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Innsbruck, Austria", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"3042", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5e23e98c93d004a8497123686df94a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "AccountId":"193631", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"9", "CreationDate":"2014-01-17T14:07:50.827", "DisplayName":"Esteban Martinez", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T17:52:59.657"}, "ViewCount":"51", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-18T17:51:18.693", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Innsbruck, Austria", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"3042", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5e23e98c93d004a8497123686df94a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "AccountId":"193631", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"9", "CreationDate":"2014-01-17T14:07:50.827", "DisplayName":"Esteban Martinez", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T17:52:59.657"}}
