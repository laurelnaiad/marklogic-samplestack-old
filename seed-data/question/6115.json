{"Body":"<p>I was taught (according to Role and Reference Grammar) that epistemic modality applies at clause level while deontic modality applies at core level. So in theory a sentence which has both would have the epistemic modality \"further away\" from the verb than the deontic. For example, <em>I [<strong>probably</strong> [<strong>have to</strong> wash the car]].</em></p>\n\n<p>But then what is happening in a sentence like <em>I should probably wash the car</em>? It seems more natural for me to say it that way than <em>I probably should wash the car</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"6115", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6132", "Title":"Epistemic modality inside deontic scope?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-11T19:41:15.163", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><modality><scope>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2373", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"56", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-13T22:12:21.020", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2373", "AccountId":"139820", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"196", "CreationDate":"2013-08-16T17:48:57.747", "DisplayName":"Moss", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-18T02:51:26.983"}}
