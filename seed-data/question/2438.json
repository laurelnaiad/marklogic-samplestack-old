{"Body":"<p>First of all, I used scare quotes on \"neutral\" because I can't think of a better word. I was going to say \"central vowels\" but that would cover some \"a\"-like vowels whereas I am only thinking of \"schwa\"-like vowels. Anyway, on with the question...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In English we have <code>/ə/</code> in words like \"the\" (mid-central unrounded).</li>\n<li>In Bulgarian there is <code>ъ</code> → <code>/ɤ/</code> (close-mid back unrounded) or <code>/ɐ/</code> (near-open central).</li>\n<li>(Hebrew has <code>ְ</code>, the source of the English word \"schwa\", but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shva\" rel=\"nofollow\">it probably doesn't fit my idea of \"neutral vowel\"</a>). </li>\n<li>(In Japanese \"i\" becomes \"neutral\" after \"sh\" and \"u\" becomes neutral after \"s\", but I don't know whether they're the same or different.)</li>\n<li>In Korean there is <code>ㅡ</code> → <code>/ɯ/</code> (close back unrounded). </li>\n<li>In Russian there is <code>ы</code> → <code>/ɨ/</code> (close central unrounded).</li>\n<li>In Turkish there is <code>ı</code> → <code>/ɯ/</code> (close back unrounded).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course many languages have no such vowels at all, such as Georgian, Italian, and Spanish.</p>\n\n<p><em>But</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In Romanian there are two contrasting sounds, each with their own letter(s): <code>ă</code> → <code>/ə/</code> (mid-central unrounded) <strong>and</strong> <code>â</code>/<code>î</code> → <code>/ɨ/</code> (close central unrounded).</li>\n<li>Also Azeri has two letters, <code>ə</code> and <code>ı</code> but I couldn't find good info on the vowel phonology if they represent the same sounds as in English and Turkish.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So how unique is the case of Romanian in having two of these \"neutral\" or \"schwa-like\" vowels? Is Azeri another example? Are there other well known languages? Little known languages?</p>\n", "Id":"2438", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"How usual is it for languages to have multiple contrasting \"neutral\" vowels?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-19T12:57:47.203", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><cross-linguistic><vowels>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-19T18:34:07.113", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-19T18:35:43.690", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
