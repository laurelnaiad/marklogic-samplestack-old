{"Body":"<p>According to <a href=\"http://wals.info/feature/37A\">WALS Feature 37A: Definite Articles</a>, 198 languages have no definite or indefinite article, and 45 have no definite article but have indefinite articles. These number excludes languages that have affixes or clitics to mark definiteness, and languages which use demonstrative words as definite articles.</p>\n\n<p>According to a comment <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/654/what-diagnostics-distinguish-demonstratives-from-definite-articles/669#669\">here</a>, \"all languages would have some way of expressing definitiness (it seems to be a necessary function for human communication), but there are plenty that don't have a definite article\". Is this true? How is definiteness expressed in those languages?</p>\n", "Id":"739", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"811", "Title":"How is definiteness expressed in languages with no definite article, clitic or affix?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-07T18:01:41.483", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<articles><definiteness>", "AnswerCount":"8", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-02T17:58:38.570", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}, "ViewCount":"893", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-15T21:41:10.760", "Score":"16", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
