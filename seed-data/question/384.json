{"Body":"<p>In the comments of another <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/379/do-some-slavic-languages-have-an-extra-gender-distinction-for-animate-nouns\">question about animate as noun gender in some Slavic languages</a> an interesting point was raised.</p>\n\n<p>Many if not most Indo European languages exhibit grammatical gender for nouns. Also it's known that for many other languages there is a broader realm of \"noun classes\", certainly in African and Australian languages and the related concept of \"counter words\" common in East Asian languages.</p>\n\n<p>So are there languages in the Indo European family which exhibit noun classes in the broader sense rather than just grammatical genders? (I'd like some references rather than just speculation please, and please only submit answers about nouns and not pronouns)</p>\n\n<p>There is one complicating factor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_class\">as mentioned in Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some authors use the term \"grammatical gender\" as a synonym of \"noun class\", but others use different definitions for each.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From what I have read a noun class, like a gender would be an attribute of each word at the lexical level and not dependent on semantics, syntax, usage, etc. This is what makes noun classes distinct from classifiers if I am not wrong.</p>\n", "Id":"384", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Do some Indo European languages reflect noun class types other than gender?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T00:33:55.623", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<indo-european><noun-classes><gender>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-22T02:49:38.717", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"276", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-04T21:22:44.700", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
