{"Body":"<p>Have very many linguists studied the structure of sentence fragments used in informal conversation in a given language?   </p>\n\n<p>In the course of informal conversation, we English speakers use lots of sentence fragments to answer questions (e.g.  (It's) \"In the barn,\" (It's) \"The roses.\"  (You can do/have/etc.) \"Whatever you want.\"  We also use fragments for other purposes, as in this fragment:  (Look out,) \"The wolf!\" (is back).  I imagine that the same is true in most languages.   </p>\n\n<p>However, some sentence fragments are clearly not permitted.  For example, we English speakers can't say \"Take the.\" (peas) for example.   </p>\n\n<p>Since linguists professional linguists can document the types of structures that are and aren't permitted in a language, I wonder which syntacticians have studied sentence fragments in informal conversation, how much work has been done in this area.   </p>\n", "Id":"1742", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1747", "Title":"Have very many linguists studied the structure of sentence fragments used in informal conversation?", "CreationDate":"2012-04-03T03:46:32.933", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<syntax>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"790", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"154", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-03T23:01:17.220", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
