{"Body":"<p>Why is the suffix for [looked] and [hugged] pronounced differently. How can I explain this process via Feature Geometry?  </p>\n\n<p>[EDIT] I know the following words respectively sound as follows lʊkt and hʌgd. I also know it has to do with the endings of the words. Words that end in k have a [t] sound with the -ed suffix and the other consonant have the [d] sound. The place of articulation simply allows the words to form like that, however I have to prove that it follows the hierarchiel structure of features and assimilation of the suffix to the final consonant of the stem. Which is where I get stuck, I have not much knowledge about this. Where do I actually start to analyse? </p>\n", "Id":"3855", "LastEditorUserId":"2152", "Title":"Why the english past tense -ed pronounced differently in some words?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-13T06:01:33.887", "OwnerUserId":"2152", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><linguistic-typology>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-13T13:20:42.773", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/R1lGG.jpg", "Id":"2152", "AccountId":"2892531", "CreationDate":"2013-06-13T05:51:32.647", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"27", "Location":"South Korea", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "DisplayName":"Stevo876", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-16T01:51:23.513"}, "ViewCount":"108", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-13T13:20:42.773", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/R1lGG.jpg", "Id":"2152", "AccountId":"2892531", "CreationDate":"2013-06-13T05:51:32.647", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"27", "Location":"South Korea", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "DisplayName":"Stevo876", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-16T01:51:23.513"}}
