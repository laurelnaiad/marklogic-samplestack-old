{"Body":"<p>A word in one language can be translated to multiple words in another language but with different popularity for each translation. Is the \"popularity\" or \"commonality\" symmetric? For example:</p>\n\n<p>Translating \"Hello\" to French can give you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Hello\" -> \"Bonjour\" (Most popular) </li>\n<li>\"Hello\" -> \"Salut\"   (Medium   popularity)</li>\n<li>\"Hello\" -> \"Tiens\"   (Least popular)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and translating \"Bonjour\" to English would lead \"Hello\" as the most popular followed by \"Hi\" and \"Good Morning\"</p>\n\n<p>Which in this example means that the most popular translation of \"hello\" to French is \"bonjour\" and the most popular translation of \"bonjour\" to English is \"hello\"</p>\n\n<p>Is this always the case in translations from one language to another?</p>\n\n<p>Does the popularity of a translation of a word from one language to another signify the popularity of the translation from the other language to the first one?</p>\n", "Id":"6299", "ClosedDate":"2014-01-10T14:28:17.810", "Title":"language translation commonality", "CreationDate":"2014-01-03T02:21:53.760", "OwnerUserId":"2964", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><cross-linguistic><translation><french>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"49", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-03T02:21:53.760", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd34b143d5cc15d87134f506f5e0032b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2964", "AccountId":"380604", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "CreationDate":"2014-01-03T02:12:16.763", "DisplayName":"Micangello", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T15:52:53.080"}}
