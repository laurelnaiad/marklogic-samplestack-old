{"Body":"<p>I am working through \"Contemporary Linguistics\" on my own.  It's been going pretty well, but I have a question about building syntax trees.</p>\n\n<p>I understand the tree here for \"The dog might bite that man\" fairly well. Now, I would like to add \"tomorrow\" to the end of the sentence.  I've looked through the book, and the only similar example I can find is using \"never\", which comes in front of the verb.</p>\n\n<p>Is this there a Move happening here?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tomorrow the dog might bite that man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is correct grammar, but I don't see anything to attach <em>tomorrow</em> to on the left side of the sentence.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>*The dog might tomorrow bite that man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not correct grammar, and I believe that means tomorrow could not have moved from there?</p>\n\n<p>I don't quite know if \"The dog tomorrow might bite that man\" is correct grammar, but it seems much less ungrammatical than *\"tomorrow bite\".  Could the adverb attach to the I?</p>\n\n<p>How can I build this tree?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vr8nH.png\" alt=\"A syntax tree for &quot;The dog might bite the man.&quot;\"></p>\n", "Id":"3078", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3080", "Title":"Syntax: How can this tree be built?", "CreationDate":"2013-01-15T17:40:20.487", "OwnerUserId":"1675", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><syntax-trees>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-15T18:05:54.690", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
