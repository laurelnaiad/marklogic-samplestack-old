{"Body":"<p>While chatting with a polish penpal, I've discovered that in Polish the expression for \"good morning/good day/hello/good afternoon\" varies if compared to the other Slavic languages; later I saw that also Belarusian has the same behavior: <em>they both invert the structure of the expression</em>, see the table below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/V3tRM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Is there a reason for this and is this reason known? I doubt it's a matter of coincidence, but I can't exclude it completely. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The above are not <em>all</em> of the Slavic languages. They include the ones I could find the expressions for, and some extra ones that I failed to do that. They have not been translated with Google translate, but they have been taken from resources to learn those languages.</p>\n", "Id":"1340", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1345", "Title":"Why do Polish and Belarusian have an atypical greeting if compared to other Slavic languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-28T11:10:55.540", "OwnerUserId":"111", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><evolution><polish>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-29T10:21:47.607", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"496", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-18T15:43:18.987", "Score":"16", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
