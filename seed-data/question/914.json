{"Body":"<p>I was reading a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8404025.stm\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC article</a> about \"linguistic fingerprints\". In my opinion a quite interesting idea, but there seems to exist a dispute in linguistic scientific community <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_linguistics#Linguistic_fingerprinting\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to Wikipedia</a>, how valid and objective such a concept is. Nevertheless, some research fields seem to use this concept in a very productive way, e.g. for <a href=\"http://www.reclaimingthemind.org/theologyinthenews/israeli-linguistic-fingerprint-algorithm-software-to-test-bible-for-authorship-attribution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysing the number of different authors of the bible</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Being no expert in linguistics, but knowing that scientists often tend to create buzzwords, can somebody with more insight explain and give a short overview, if this dispute really exists and where linguistic researchers disagree? Is the concepts itself flawed, as such a quantity would be hard to measure in a valid, reliable and objective way (Operationalization). Or is it rather the the assumption that the \"linguistic fingerprint\" phenomenon doesn't exist at all? </p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, I tend to believe in this concept and would assume that the unique elements of a single human fingerprint not only are typical used words and phrases, but also typical length of sentences, use of subordinate clauses. Reading and moderating over a decade in internet forums and usenet, the \"linguistic fingerprint\" concept seems quite obvious to me, the correct operationlization is of course very tricky.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Wiki-Definition of linguistic fingerprint:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"914", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"922", "Title":"Is there serious scientific evidence/vindication for the \"linguistic fingerprint\" concept?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-30T14:33:43.250", "OwnerUserId":"192", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<theoretical-linguistics><forensic-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-30T17:31:36.103", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
