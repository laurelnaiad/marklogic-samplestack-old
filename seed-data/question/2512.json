{"Body":"<p>In a related but different question to <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/2504/indo-european-prepositions-from-whence-did-they-come\">Indo-European prepositions: from whence did they come?</a>, why do just about all modern Indo-European languages have prepositions rather than postpositions? </p>\n\n<p>PIE is believed to have been an SOV language, and like textbook examples of SOV languages it had relational postpositions rather than prepositions. Yet every modern Indo-European language I know of uses prepositions primarily (one or two have postpositions as well, but in such languages prepositions are a clear majority). Even Latin, which looks to have a nominal word order of SOV (though the inflectional case system allowed for large variation in word order) has exclusively prepositions (excluding the comitative pseudo-case where previously postpositional \"cum\" - which, I may add, is a preposition in Latin - was reduced to a suffix). </p>\n\n<p>How is it that just about every Indo-European language converted to prepositions (presumably) in parallel, when such a change contradicts typical word order laws?</p>\n", "Id":"2512", "LastEditorUserId":"3020", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Indo-European prepositions: why prepositions?", "CreationDate":"2012-09-02T20:24:23.197", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><proto-indo-european><indo-european><word-order><prepositions>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-15T16:13:52.323", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc82Y.jpg?s=128&g=1", "Id":"3020", "AccountId":"2596734", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"167", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T16:08:59.447", "DisplayName":"Marjeta", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T20:16:21.790"}, "ViewCount":"171", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T16:13:52.323", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/JustinOlbrantz", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1097", "AccountId":"1561933", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"470", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.637", "DisplayName":"Justin Olbrantz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:48:30.797"}}
