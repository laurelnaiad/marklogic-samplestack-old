{"Body":"<p>I vaguely remember reading something years ago on this subject --an article in a magazine or something, I don't even remember-- but what I <em>do</em> remember is the theme that it's supposedly common for languages to conflate \"sense of touch\" with \"emotional well-being\".</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is a common metaphor in English:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The rock feels rough.\" (Implication: the speaker felt/touched it.)</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I feel rough.\" (Implication: the speaker felt/touched themselves?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I'm wondering is, <em>is</em> this actually a pattern?</p>\n\n<p>For instance, the situation with \"f√ºhlen\" is much the same in German, but that doesn't count unless the metaphor developed independently, with no inter-language borrowing or common inheritance from a shared parent language.</p>\n\n<p>Japanese \"genki\" (\"original energy/spirit/air\"?) seems like an immediately obvious counter-example to me. (And I would guess that Japanese originally obtained it as a borrowing from Chinese, so...? I obviously can't conclude much from that.)</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what sort of studies may have been done on this? Any widely-accepted conclusions...?</p>\n", "Id":"6067", "Title":"Conflation of \"sense of touch\" with \"emotional well-being\"?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-04T06:39:12.723", "AnswerCount":"2", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2816", "Tags":"<comparative-linguistics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"62", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-07T20:08:30.037", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef24f914f8da8d9ba82945e7dd479dab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2816", "AccountId":"1247045", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2013-12-04T06:03:44.397", "DisplayName":"Owen_R", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-08T14:56:32.210"}}
