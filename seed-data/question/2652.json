{"Body":"<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> While writing a document about foundations of computer science and describing that a number is a sequence of digits, I was wondering about our relation to the decimal system.</p>\n\n<p>In English counting goes like this: \"one\", \"two\" and \"three\". If we create a number with 2 digits, the number might be called \"forty-two\". \"Forty\" is an alias for 4‧10<sup>1</sup> and \"two\" adds 2‧10<sup>0</sup>. So it refers explicitly to the decimal system, because neither \"forty-two\" nor \"ten\" exists in binary<sup>1</sup>. The language uses decimal-based aliases. \"Dreizehn\" (3+10 = 13) and \"quatre-vingt trois\" (4*20+3 = 83) are instances of the same concept in German and French.</p>\n\n<p>Cerberus has pointed out that Aztecs and Babylonians have used different number systems from the very beginning which of course became part of the spoken language (radix <a href=\"http://www.math.temple.edu/~zit/Native%20American/9%20Aztecs_num.pdf\">20</a> and <a href=\"http://www.math.twsu.edu/history/topics/num-sys.html#babylonian\">60</a>). A nice hint, but I am interested in modern, spoken languages.</p>\n\n<p>My question: Which modern, spoken languages do not imply the decimal system<sup>2</sup>? I would be happy to be able to find 2 to that kind.</p>\n\n<p>A related question is <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/52494/how-do-you-pronounce-numbers-written-in-different-bases\">How do you pronounce numbers written in different bases?</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1: It might be a valid point that \"ten\" is an alias for 1‧10<sup>1</sup> + 0‧10<sup>0</sup> and therefore \"ten\" can also be applied to the binary system with 10<sub>2</sub> = 2<sub>10</sub>, but that is pretty uncommon and I am not sure about it. Correct me if I am wrong. See related link.</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup>2: With \"language without the implication\" I mean \"the pronunciation of a number is only a concatenation of the pronunciation of the individual digits\".</sup></p>\n", "Id":"2652", "LastEditorUserId":"1282", "FavoriteCount":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2657", "Title":"Which modern, spoken languages do not imply the decimal number system?", "CreationDate":"2012-10-05T12:40:54.817", "OwnerUserId":"1282", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<numbers>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-05T20:57:20.207", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1282", "AccountId":"1782512", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"56", "CreationDate":"2012-08-25T18:25:50.583", "DisplayName":"meisterluk", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-16T19:45:03.463"}, "ViewCount":"343", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-12T16:15:47.757", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"13", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1282", "AccountId":"1782512", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"56", "CreationDate":"2012-08-25T18:25:50.583", "DisplayName":"meisterluk", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-16T19:45:03.463"}}
