{"Body":"<p>In <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4651536127874730779&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,36\">2008 Edward Vajda presented his decade-long research</a> into a connection between the <a href=\"http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2678-16\">Yeniseian languages</a> of central Siberia (e.g. <a href=\"http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/ket.shtml\">Ket</a>, <a href=\"http://www.language-archives.org/language/yuu\">Yugh</a>) and the American <a href=\"http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=609-16\">Na-Dené</a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabaskan_languages\">Athabaskan</a>–<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/eyaklanguageproject/\">Eyak</a>–<a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tlingit.htm\">Tlingit</a>) family. His conclusion was the the languages were indeed related in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den%C3%A9%E2%80%93Yeniseian_languages\">Dené–Yeniseian family</a>, a significant finding since if correct it would be the first genetic linguistic connection between the Old and New Worlds. Definitely big news, and as I recall it was generally positively received at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in understanding: <strong>what is the general view in the academic linguistics community of this research now that time has passed to examine it?</strong> I'm also curious as to whether Prof Vajda's research is being built upon by any other groups now? </p>\n", "Id":"1434", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "FavoriteCount":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1435", "Title":"Is the Dené–Yeniseian hypothesis widely accepted, and has it led to further research?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-16T03:49:17.590", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><american-languages>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-30T11:20:23.103", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "ViewCount":"292", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-30T11:20:23.103", "Score":"17", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
