{"Body":"<p>I'm currently in Thailand and a bit frustrated with the difficult writing system here. Normally after a week in a country I can learn the writing system to a functional degree (except Han characters of course).</p>\n\n<p>I can draw the characters just fine but many characters look alike and many characters represent the same sound, but the two sets of \"alikeness\" are totally independent and unrelated!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore I'd like to learn the most frequent letters first. But short of wandering around in the heat and humidity with a notepad and building a frequency table myself, I'm sure there must be a letter frequency list out there for Thai already. Can somebody point me to it?</p>\n", "Id":"4317", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4367", "Title":"Looking for Thai letter-frequency resource", "CreationDate":"2013-08-30T06:08:56.290", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><written-language><frequency><thai>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"51", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"79", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-31T16:04:21.853", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
