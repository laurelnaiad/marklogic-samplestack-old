{"Body":"<p>I want to measure the quality of speech: is it higher level/lower level (vocabulary grammar etc.) and also the understandability of the speech, i.e. is the teacher using language above a student's head?)</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test\">Flesch Kincaid</a> readability test is a measurement of a written document's readability (which really is a measurement of understandability).  There are numerous methods of measuring written text's readability, but processing spoken text is different from written text.  Is there a similar way to measure spoken text for understandability? I have transcribed (typed) dialogue.  </p>\n\n<p>P.S. <em>I've seen the Flesch Kincaid applied to speech, including President Obama's speeches, and used to determine the quality of the language used, but it seems inappropriate to use a readability measurement for spoken text as well as using readability for measuring quality.</em></p>\n", "Id":"1194", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "FavoriteCount":"4", "Title":"Is there an equivalent to the Flesch Kincaid test for measuring quality and understandability of speech?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-22T19:24:24.400", "OwnerUserId":"607", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><sociolinguistics><language-competence><applied-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-23T00:38:58.173", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"256", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-19T15:43:58.737", "Score":"12", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"12", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.talkstats.com", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"607", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"948131", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"256", "CreationDate":"2011-12-19T21:32:00.067", "DisplayName":"Tyler Rinker", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-18T17:06:45.570", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a Literacy PhD student at the University at Buffalo.</p>\n"}}
