{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>As Alex B. points out in his comment to your question, some writers (especially earlier ones) use \"sufformative\" interchangably with \"suffix\".

According to Pratico and Van Pelt, <em>Basics of Biblical Hebrew</em>, 2nd ed.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Perfect conjugation is also called the \"suffix conjugation\" because different inflectional endings or <em>sufformatives</em> are added to the verbal root in order to indicate person, gender, and number.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when Block refers to sufformatives, I think he's describing verbal inflectional endings, rather than other types of suffix such as plural suffixes on nouns and so on.</p>\n", "Id":"2906", "ParentId":"2884", "CreationDate":"2012-11-28T09:36:14.510", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1492", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-28T09:36:14.510", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1492", "AccountId":"2039682", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"325", "CreationDate":"2012-11-14T14:40:19.727", "DisplayName":"Berthilde", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-10T16:24:27.427", "AboutMe":"<p>Native English and Welsh speaker, enthusiastic learner of Flemish/Dutch, French, German, and occasionally Italian.</p>\n\n<p>My doctorate is in medieval English.
