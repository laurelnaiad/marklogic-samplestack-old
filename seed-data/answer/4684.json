The idea is that there is a limited set of <em>semantic primes</em> which are themselves undefinable and also universal. But with that set of primes, every other meaning can be defined/explicated.</p>\n\n<p>Conveniently, someone has already made an NSM definition for <em>friend</em>! These definitions are always a work in progress, but it might give you a good place to start your investigation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>(my) friend =\nI think about this person like this:\n    I know this person well\n    when I do things with this person, I feel something good\n    when I am with this person, I feel something good\nI know this person thinks the same about me\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=3_1snsgmqU8C&amp;pg=PA613\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source: Concise Encyclopedia of Semantics</a></p>\n", "Id":"4684", "ParentId":"4682", "LastEditorUserId":"2555", "CreationDate":"2013-10-10T03:52:36.020", "OwnerUserId":"2555", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-11T02:15:50.263", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"70", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"2555", "DownVotes":"16", "AccountId":"3401915", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"311", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:31:40.093", "DisplayName":"curiousdannii", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T22:35:43.143", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-11T02:15:50.263", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"70", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"2555", "DownVotes":"16", "AccountId":"3401915", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"311", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:31:40.093", "DisplayName":"curiousdannii", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T22:35:43.143", "AboutMe":""}}
