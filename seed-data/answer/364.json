{"Body":"<p>An additional answer would be that phonetics is concerned with the physical processes of speech (production, processing) while phonology is concerned with abstractly modeling speech processes. There is a lot of overlap between the two areas and it is difficult at times to figure out if a process should  be considered phonetic (a physical result) or phonological (basically a rule that is not physically necessary).  </p>\n\n<p>An example of this is something like voicing assimilation. Say you have two words which in isolation sound like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[ap] [ga]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And you put them together:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>/ap+ga/</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the resulting sound is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[abga]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The [p] became [b]. Why? A phonological answer could be that /g/ has some feature controlling its voicing [+voice] and /p/ has a feature [-voice] making it voiceless. Then putting them adjacent, the /p/ latches on to /g/'s [+voice] feature and let's go of it's [-voice] feature, making it a voiced /p/ ([b]).</p>\n\n<p>A phonetic answer could be something like, in anticipation of the voicing for producing [g] you also voice somewhat during a production of [p], making it more [b]-like.</p>\n", "Id":"364", "ParentId":"180", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T18:08:52.713", "OwnerUserId":"235", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-15T15:14:34.577", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
