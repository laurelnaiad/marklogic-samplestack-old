It doesn't help that they are non-academic and free of references. I have always interpreted names like \"Bill\" and \"Dick\" to be caused by child phonology. It's hardly a coincidence that both the change from \"William\" to \"Bill\" and \"Richard\" to \"Dick\" can be formulated in phonological terms. They've changed from disyllabic to monosyllabic forms, and their continuants have become stops, yet retain both the voice and place features of the original form. Those are all highly familiar features of child phonology.</p>\n", "Id":"3625", "ParentId":"3616", "CreationDate":"2013-04-29T13:41:06.623", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"105", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-29T13:41:06.623", "CommentCount":"2"}
