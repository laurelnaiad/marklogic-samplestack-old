First of all, you need to escape the stars (with backslashes) or they will be interpreted as wildcards.  Second, pro-drop is indicated by <code>*pro*</code> (note lowercase).  Finally, you need to specify the query function.  You probably want this line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>query: (NP-SBJ iDominates \\*pro\\*)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using <code>NP-SBJ*</code> as kaleissin suggested won't hurt, but it won't help with this issue either.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, if you copied that query directly out of the manual, it is certainly a documentation bug.  If you can show me where specifically it came from, I can see that it is fixed.</p>\n", "Id":"1795", "ParentId":"1790", "CreationDate":"2012-04-15T20:00:11.370", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"930", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-15T20:00:11.370", "CommentCount":"1"}
