{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Chinese has very little morphology, so words don't change to indicate a different part of speech. This means that many words can be of uncertain lexical class membership when on their own. But the same is true of many words in English as well (called zero-derivation). For Chinese (again, like English) syntax can be the only thing that indicates the lexical class items belong to. But when used in a particular location in a clause the membership is fixed, so lexical classes are present and are strict. There are some languages that seem not to have true lexical classes such as Samoan, where the one sentence can be interpreted differently depending on whether words are treated as nouns or verbs (so word order doesn't determine lexical class membership).</p>\n\n<p>I hope that makes sense!</p>\n", "Id":"667", "ParentId":"661", "CreationDate":"2011-10-03T03:08:34.417", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-03T03:08:34.417", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ãœmlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}}
