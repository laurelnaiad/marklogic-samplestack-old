{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Yes, Japanese has determiners, such as the demonstrative <em>kono</em> (this). It has been argued that the ability of some other nominal modifiers to precede the demonstrative shows that Japanese demonstratives are not determiners. However, possessives (like John's or Bill's) are typically analysed as a type of determiner. Many languages have multiple determiners on a single noun, such as Swedish (in definite noun phrases with adjectives) and Icelandic (with possessive constructions, much like the Japanese examples in <em>An introduction to Japanese linguistics</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <em>An introduction to Japanese linguistics</em> does not adopt the DP Hypothesis, which means that NP is a maximal projection and not contained within a DP (as is commonly assumed nowadays). This affects the analysis greatly. Of course, even without the DP Hypothesis, a phrase can have multiple specifiers under many analyses, so I don't agree with the argument presented there.</p>\n", "Id":"327", "ParentId":"85", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T19:19:08.867", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"164", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-20T19:19:08.867", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.lowter.com", "Id":"164", "AccountId":"29190", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T15:01:53.727", "AboutMe":"<p>I study linguistics and Scandinavian languages at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"111", "DisplayName":"Ethan", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-28T15:46:42.437"}}
