{"Body":"<p>Dental/interdental fricatives are quite rare among languages worldwide. A survey of 567 languages (<a href=\"http://wals.info/chapter/19\">Maddison 2011</a>) found only 42 languages with such sounds. English just happens to be one of these.</p>\n\n<p>To address the point made in @musicallinguist 's answer, dental and interdental fricatives probably do not arise in some languages, and get easily lost in other languages because: (i) they are not very acoustically salient, and (ii) they are more difficult to produce. I'll only address the first point. The noise associated with their production is of relative low intensity compared to sibilant sounds like [s]. The latter is made by directing a fast-moving airstream to impinge against the lower incisors, resulting in a noisy, conspicuous sound. Non-sibilant fricatives like the interdental and [f] in English are made by pushing air through a slit formed between the upper incisors and either the tongue blade or lower lips, and the resultant noise is not as noisy and more spectrally diffuse (see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3183204\">Behrend &amp; Blumstein (1988)</a>). A useful observation that you hear in phonetics classes is that \"obstacle\" turbulence is noisier than \"channel\" turbulence. </p>\n\n<p>The spectral profile of 'th' is similar to that of [f], so the two can be confused based on their noise components. However, the formant transitions on neighboring vowels are similar in 'th' and [s], so 'th' can also be confused with [s] (see <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1405101237\">Johnson 2003:132--3</a>)</p>\n", "Id":"2321", "ParentId":"2320", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "CreationDate":"2012-07-30T18:58:35.853", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-08T00:09:03.177", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-08T00:09:03.177", "Score":"18", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
