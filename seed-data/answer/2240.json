In your case it happens to have been a pidgin, which is a little special, but I don’t suppose your case is really much different from those who grow up speaking southern US English, Caribbean English or the English of the north-east of England known as Geordie. The dialect we learn first will usually be the one we feel most comfortable with and Standard English may seem like a foreign language, although its differences from non-standard varieties are not that great.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not surprising that few people grow up speaking Standard English, because it is predominantly a written form of the language. It may to that extent be a minority dialect, but it’s an extremely important one politically, economically and socially. For that reason those who want to make their way in an English-speaking world need to learn it. But many English speakers may want to retain their native dialects and to use them with their family and friends, keeping Standard English for writing and for those occasions where a more formal spoken language is required. There’s nothing unusual about such an arrangement. For many people in the world being bilingual, or even multilingual, is the norm.</p>\n", "Id":"2240", "ParentId":"2238", "comments":[], "CreationDate":"2012-07-11T06:32:11.840", "Score":"12", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"281", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-11T06:32:11.840", "CommentCount":"4"}
