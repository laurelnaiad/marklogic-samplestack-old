The best thing about this is that it's time aligned, and allows you to \"pull out\" the written transcript for analysis in other programs. </p>\n\n<p>It sounds like you're transcribing and encoding text that is already written, in which case <a href=\"http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CLAN</a> might be more appropriate for you. Although it was created for the massive CHILDES project, I know people use it for other written transcripts as it allows for good encoding and some analysis within the program. I haven't used it but other people might be able to tell you more about it.</p>\n", "Id":"3207", "ParentId":"3197", "CreationDate":"2013-02-16T11:42:35.037", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"64", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-16T11:42:35.037", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"126", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.superlinguo.com", "Id":"64", "AccountId":"900445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:45:12.903", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a PhD in linguistics.
