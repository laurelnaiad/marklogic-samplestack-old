In CxG you have something called <strong>constructions</strong> which are symbolic units that directly link form and meaning. A construction can the be a word, say <em>tree</em>, but it also can be an idiom <em>kick the bucket</em>, or a semifixed construction [the mother of all X] or [what is X doing Y] (what is that fly doing in my soup?), or an argument structure construction (kinda hard to represent). Syntax then is intrinsically interrelated to semantics, and there is a really strong link between both. </p>\n\n<p>There are many flavours of construction grammar, you have on the one hand some very formalist approaches like sign based CxG by Kay and Fillmore; and on the other hand some more cognitive takes on the matter like Langacker, Croft, Bybee or Goldberg. I like better this latter approaches, if you are interested you should check out Croft 2001 <em>Radical Construction Grammar</em> and Langackers <em>Cognitive Grammar</em>, also Goldberg has a very important book <em>Constructions: A Construction Grammar Approach to Argument Structure</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"3750", "ParentId":"3749", "CreationDate":"2013-05-22T10:55:31.430", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1975", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-22T10:55:31.430", "CommentCount":"2"}
