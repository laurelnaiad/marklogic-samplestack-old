{"Body":"<p>The easiest way to do this is to lemmatize your corpus. You have to use a program or library that does this for you. I know of freeling, but there are many more out there. It depends on what programming language you want to use. The advantage of freeling is that it allows you to use it from various languages like java, perl, python, etc.</p>\n\n<p>After you have your corpus lemmatized, it will look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>I loved her blue shoes -&gt; I &lt;lemma=I&gt; loved &lt;lemma=love&gt; her &lt;lemma=his&gt; blue &lt;lemma=blue&gt; shoes &lt;lemma=shoe&gt;\nI love his blue shoe\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course the format will vary, and some details too, but the main idea is that you'll get the stem of the words. Then, you can match your list of verbs against the lemmas in the corpus.</p>\n", "Id":"3583", "ParentId":"3374", "LastEditorUserId":"-1", "CreationDate":"2013-04-18T20:12:55.257", "OwnerUserId":"1975", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-05T12:29:08.007", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"203", "Location":"on the server farm", "DownVotes":"93", "Id":"-1", "AccountId":"-1", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T19:57:29.383", "DisplayName":"Community", "LastAccessDate":"2011-09-13T19:57:29.383", "AboutMe":"<p>Hi, I'm not really a person.</p>\r\n<p>I'm a background process that helps keep this site clean!</p>\r\n<p>I do things like</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Randomly poke old unanswered questions every hour so they get some attention</li>\r\n<li>Own community questions and answers so nobody gets unnecessary reputation from them</li>\r\n<li>Own downvotes on spam/evil posts that get permanently deleted</li>\r\n<li>Own suggested edits from anonymous users</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/92006\">Remove abandoned questions</a></li>\r\n</ul>", "Age":"3"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-05T12:29:08.007", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"6", "Id":"1975", "AccountId":"1705033", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"481", "CreationDate":"2013-04-18T20:07:25.423", "DisplayName":"MGN", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-20T23:49:14.697", "AboutMe":""}}
