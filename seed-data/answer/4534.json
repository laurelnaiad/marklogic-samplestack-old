{"Body":"<p>I think, the key point answering this question would be by understanding the <strong>distinction between an <em>alphabet</em> and a <em>script</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<h1>Some boring definitions</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alphabet</a> is defined as a set of letters. Examples are <em>Latin</em>, <em>Cyrillic</em>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Script, or, more formally, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">Writing system</a>, is a <em>language-specific</em> set of rules used to encode a text in a particular language.</p>\n\n<p>For each language, script includes (a part of) a certain <em>Alphabet</em>, certain type of <em>Numerals</em>, <em>Punctuation marks</em>, and other symbols.</p>\n\n<h1>Now, let's get to the question</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With regard to English, is there any other symbols that can compose a word?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_writing_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">English writing system</a> includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Latin letters, letter-case and capital-case, obviously;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arabic numerals</a>, obviously;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_terms_with_diacritical_marks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diacritic marks</a> used for loanwords;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_in_English\" rel=\"nofollow\">Punctuation symbols</a> - make sure your software properly processes similarly looking symbols, e.g. apostrophes used to mark possession, and to mark contractions;</li>\n<li>For Natural Language Processing (NLP) software, you have to be aware that most characters with diacritic marks have their own Unicode points, so, for instance, parsing a sequence of <code>A</code> and ◌&#x0302; (a zero-width <em>combining circumflex accent</em> modifier, U+0302, not to be confused with a standalone character <code>^</code>) should work exactly as parsing a single code point of <code>Â</code> (<em>Latin A with circumflex</em>)</li>\n<li>If you are parsing Unicode text, you have to be also aware about ligatures, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_words_that_may_be_spelled_with_a_ligature\" rel=\"nofollow\">here's the list</a>, and there may be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_%28typography%29#Stylistic_ligatures\" rel=\"nofollow\">stylistic ligatures</a> as well;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additionally, I would be interested in learning about other European languages and there use of such symbols within words which fall outside those defined by the alphabet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, don't look into an <em>alphabet</em>. Look into <em>writing system</em> of a corresponding language.</p>\n", "Id":"4534", "ParentId":"4531", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-09-23T20:23:12.910", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-24T00:50:34.497", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-24T00:50:34.497", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
