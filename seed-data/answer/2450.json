A very simple example would be combining a down stroke with a bottom left stroke to form an 'L', or a down stroke with a backwards downwards curve to form a 'D'.</p>\n\n<p>I have no experience in the area, but I feel that with a proper deconstruction of the graphemes, a keyboard could be created that simply combines the different shapes or characteristics of each character to form the extended alphabet. The learning curve would definitely be steeper than that of a smaller alphabet where each key represents a single character, but with extensive study in the phonology of the language it may be possible to create a mapping that places the parts statistically more likely to be combined closer together.</p>\n", "Id":"2450", "ParentId":"2090", "CreationDate":"2012-08-21T18:10:24.700", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1165", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-21T18:10:24.700", "CommentCount":"1"}
