{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>With a minor in Sociology you will be much better prepared to use the theoretical stand of Sociology in the context of Linguistics. Unfortunately (see SAGE Handbook of Sociolinguistics for more on this) the field of sociolinguistics has had several instances where non-sociologist linguists would have benefited from previously developed Sociological theory in their own linguistic studies. If you hope to be primarily a linguist (sociolinguist, anthropological linguist, etc.), having a background in Sociology can only help. If you hope to be a Sociologist, knowing Linguistics may also help as your subjects will all use language in some form or another. Being able to link the two together will only benefit you.</p>\n\n<p>Take sociology courses that interest you. You will find ways to link them to linguistics. Systems of social hierarchy, power, segregation, gender, homosexual and transgender studies, education, politics, military, etc. If you want to, you ought to be able to link linguistics into any aspect of sociology.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck in your classes!</p>\n", "Id":"2444", "ParentId":"2440", "CreationDate":"2012-08-20T16:49:46.797", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1266", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-20T16:49:46.797", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"UT", "Id":"1266", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1760544", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"51", "CreationDate":"2012-08-17T19:48:23.430", "DisplayName":"Brad Miller", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-15T02:15:07.717", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a graduate student in Linguistics.
