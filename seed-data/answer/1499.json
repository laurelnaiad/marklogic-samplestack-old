{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Language is a complex system used simultaneously by a large number of people. Changes typically begin on a very limited area and spread to eventually encompass the entire language. (Or not. That's a simple version of how dialects come into being.) Whether they succeed and spread or fail and die out, depends on how people (individuals) talk to one another.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, changes in language spread not entirely unlike diseases. It is usually relatively easy to find out how and where a pandemic started but it is very difficult to foresee one. There are many places in the world where the hygienic conditions are horrible but somehow a pandemic does not break out. (That is similar to Aaron's example of English having been ripe for developing NC for centuries.) And at the same time, there are places where hygienic conditions are not bad at all, and yet a disease can from time to time manage to spread very far.</p>\n\n<p>Another analogy would be road or air traffic. When an accident happens, we are usually able to reconstruct how it happened. But regrettably, we are no good at predicting where and when one is going to happen, so we can't prevent it.</p>\n", "Id":"1499", "ParentId":"463", "CreationDate":"2012-02-26T17:34:09.447", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"794", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-26T17:34:09.447", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}}
