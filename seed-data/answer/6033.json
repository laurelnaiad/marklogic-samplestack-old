{"Body":"<p>Your question is methodologically misconstrued - any hypothesis can be verified or refuted only within a certain paradigm/framework, cf.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"<strong>scientific statements can only be made within a theory</strong>\" (Bierwisch 1971).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Igor Mel'chuk (Mel'cuk 1988: 12) puts it very nicely - the following applies to any syntactic theory:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By its logical nature, dependency formalism cannot be \"proved\" or falsified. [..] Dependency formalism is a tool proposed for representing linguistic reality1, and, <strong>like any other tool, it may or may not prove sufficiently useful, flexible or appropriate for the task for which it has been devised; but it cannot be true or false</strong> [emphasis mine - Alex B.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There can be no theory-neutral evidence to refute or verify the existence of a finite VP. As a matter of fact, just in your question there are the following assumptions: the existence of a VP, finite VP, constituents etc., cf.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"<strong>constituents are neither essential nor fundamental to linguistic structure</strong>\" (Langacker 1997: 9)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>see also Carnie 2008: 18 \"we will find many instances where these [constituency - Alex B.] tests can give false results and results that are contradictory with the output of other tests.\" </p>\n", "Id":"6033", "ParentId":"6031", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2013-11-29T00:57:39.350", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-29T22:18:41.323", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-29T22:18:41.323", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
