{"Body":"<p>Intransitive sentences can be either unaccusative or unergative based on the the subject's thematic role.\nIf the subject is the agent, the resulting construction is <strong>unergative</strong>. (e.g. Jane sneezed or John danced).</p>\n\n<p>If the subject is <strong>not</strong> an agent, the sentence is <strong>unaccusative</strong>. (e.g. Jane arrived or The snow melted)</p>\n\n<p>Ergative  and accusative refer to cases (noun inflections). In languages that have it, accusative marks the objects of transitive verbs. Ergative case marks the subject of transitive verbs. </p>\n\n<p>Languages are often divided into Nominative-Accusative and Ergative-Absolutive, but this is an over-simplification. The Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> on the subject is pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there is some arcane connection between ergative/accusative and unergative/unaccusative, but in practice they aren't related.</p>\n", "Id":"875", "ParentId":"872", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T02:47:50.803", "OwnerUserId":"297", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastEditorDisplayName":"user325", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-25T16:59:17.703", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-25T16:59:17.703", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"15", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Toronto, Canada", "Id":"297", "DownVotes":"3", "AccountId":"165876", "Views":"15", "Reputation":"382", "CreationDate":"2011-09-25T17:19:38.000", "DisplayName":"Dan Milway", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-16T15:34:03.560", "AboutMe":""}}
