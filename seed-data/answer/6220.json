If you have two successive identical vowels, they're always going to form two syllables; if you have one long vowel, it's always going to form one syllable.</p>\n\n<p>There can also be phonetic differences in pitch etc., but not necessarily.</p>\n\n<p><em>Are there languages that have both phonemic vowel length and double vowels?</em></p>\n\n<p>Yes.
