{"Body":"<p>At first, you misquoted Wikipedia. What it actually says (the current edit) is that \"<strong>in the north of the Netherlands and in North Central American usually diphthongized to [oʊ]</strong>.\" The same Wikipedia article has lots of examples when it \"stands just by itself.\"</p>\n\n<p>In British English, things are way more complicated. Although [əʊ] is the most common variant now, there are other variants, too; see part 8.10.4 in <a href=\"http://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/Title/9780340958773/Gimsons_Pronunciation_of_English_Seventh_Edition.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gimson's Pronunciation of English</a> (7th ed.).</p>\n\n<p>And there are British dialects where [o:] is not diphthongized. After all, <strong>in Middle English it wasn't, either.</strong> It got diphthongized during the Great Vowel Shift. There are dialects where the glide is a schwa etc.</p>\n\n<p>For some discussion based on the material of English dialects (the so called goat test), see Wells, J. C. 1981. Accents of English.
