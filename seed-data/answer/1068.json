If the rules are too complex for a child to learn, the complex rules will eventually be destroyed by repeated failure of people to assimilate and follow the rules.</p>\n\n<p>I think my view is pretty consistent with the theory that there is a universal grammar that all languages follow.  All languages evolve to be ones that a child can master, based on a humans natural language to understand grammatical rules.  I would add that languages can acquire some variance and some complexity, but they have to be master-able by children to survivor.</p>\n", "Id":"1068", "ParentId":"778", "CreationDate":"2011-11-24T21:16:07.370", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"532", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-24T21:16:07.370", "CommentCount":"1"}
