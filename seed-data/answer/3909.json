{"Body":"<p>It is true that <em>opse</em> was used as a preposition meaning \"after\", even in Antiquity, if we are to believe <a href=\"http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=lsj&amp;lang=el&amp;word=o%29ye/&amp;filter=CUTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liddell-Scott-Jones</a>, which is a highly reputable source:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4.) <strong>as Prep. c. gen.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>ὀ. τούτων \"after these things\", Philostr.VA6.10, cf. 4.18;</p>\n  \n  <p>so perh. ὀ. σαββάτων \"after the sabbath day\", Ev.Matt.28.1.—</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know what happened to <em>opse</em> as a preposition in later Greek, but I'll take your word for it that it disappeared. It is certainly possible that one factor working against it was the existence of <em>meta</em> + acc. \"after\"; however, the latter is both older and far more frequent than <em>opse</em> \"after\", so then how do you explain the fact that <em>meta</em> allowed such a competitor to rise at all, and why did it decide to oust <em>opse</em> later rather than sooner?</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, <em>meta</em> \"after\" may have been a factor, but this is likely to be a very complex matter. For starters, perhaps <em>opse</em> \"after\" was used in a different register? It was never very common anyway, I believe.</p>\n", "Id":"3909", "ParentId":"3908", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-06-25T12:29:43.623", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-25T12:43:45.630", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-25T12:43:45.630", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
