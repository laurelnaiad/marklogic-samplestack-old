{"Body":"<p>The second person singular pronoun in PIE was <strong><em>tua̯om</em></strong> (or <strong><em>tue̯om</em></strong>). This explains why many languages have t- in the first position in second-person pronoun.</p>\n\n<p>There was no third-person personal pronoun in PIE. In such cases one could use either demonstrative (like \"that\") or reflexive (like \"themself\").</p>\n\n<p>The reflexive pronoun <strong><em>su̯em</em></strong> in PIE was one for all persons (unlike English where you see \"yourself\", \"himself\") etc.</p>\n\n<p>The demonstrative pronouns (like \"that\") were <strong><em>so</em></strong> for masculine, <strong><em>sea̯</em></strong> for feminine and <strong><em>tod</em></strong> for neuter. </p>\n\n<p>Looking at this you can see that both reflexive and the demonstratives could be the origin for s- in third person pronouns in descendant languages.</p>\n", "Id":"4427", "ParentId":"4425", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2013-09-11T20:30:21.230", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-12T09:36:21.270", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-12T09:36:21.270", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
