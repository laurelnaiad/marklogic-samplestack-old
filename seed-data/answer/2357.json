{"Body":"<p>I think you’re looking at this backwards.  </p>\n\n<p>The Portuguese word spelled <em>sim</em> did not come to be pronounced <code>[sĩ]</code> through some sort of assimilation of nasal consonant, the way occurred with Portuguese <em>fim</em> <code>[fĩ]</code> and <em>um</em> <code>[ũ]</code>, or even <em>sem</em> &lt; Latin <em>sine</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>Rather, the word came to be pronounced that way, and so came to spelled in a way that indicated its nasalization, and ‹im› is simply how one spells <code>[ĩ]</code> there.  </p>\n\n<p>Although not all nasalization in Portuguese is explicitly marked in the orthography (for example, in <em>muito</em> <code>[mũĩ̯tu]</code>),  with <em>sim</em> <code>[sĩ]</code>, it is. Similarly, Portuguese <em>assim</em> <code>[ɐˈsĩ]</code> is written with an ‹im›.  This developed from Latin <em>ad sic</em>, “with nasalization”.<sup>[<a href=\"http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/portugues/index.php?lingua=portugues-portugues&amp;palavra=assim\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>]</sup>  The history of Portuguese is complex and uneven, and did not settle down until much later than in languages such as neighboring Spanish did back in the 1500s. </p>\n\n<p>Nasalization and palatalizations were variously marked with an tilde,  with an <em>n</em> or <em>m</em>, or with a following <em>h</em> — or with some combination of these:<sup>[<a href=\"http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortografia_da_l%EDngua_portuguesa#Hist.C3.B3ria_da_ortografia_da_l.C3.ADngua_portuguesa\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>]</sup> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>cimco > cinco</li>\n<li>grãde > grande</li>\n<li>tẽpo > tempo</li>\n<li>razõ > razom</li>\n<li>camĩho > caminho</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the earliest preserved texts of what would become Portuguese, you see the letter <em>h</em> used innovatively, as in <em>sabha</em> for <em>sabia</em>, or <em>mha</em> for what become modern <em>minha, meu</em>. For example, Dom Denis wrote in one of his <em>Cantigas de Amor</em>:<sup>[<a href=\"http://cfp.cm-lisboa.pt/pls/htmldb/f?p=334:6:3977332719096491%3a%3a%3a%3aP6_POE_ID,P6_TEP_ID,P6_ANCORA,P6_AUTOR,P6_POEMA,P6_ID,P6_TIPO:2322,16010,7,Dom%20Dinis,%5BPROEN%C7AES%20SOEN%20MUI%20BEM%20TROBAR%5D,73,autor\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>]</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><i>Proençaes soen mui ben trobar<br>\n   e dizen eles que é con amor;<br>\n   mais os que troban no tempo da frol<br>\n   e non en outro, sei eu ben que non<br>\n   an tan gran coita no seu coraçon<br>\n   qual m'eu por <strong>mha senhor</strong> vejo levar.</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In contrast, Afonso Xº wrote <em>mia</em> for the same word used in the same situation in his <em>Cantigas de Santa Maria</em>:<sup>[<a href=\"http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/Cantigas_de_Santa_Maria/LV\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>]</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><i>Con sennor, assi dizia, | chorando mui feramente:<br>\n   «<strong>Mia Sennor</strong>, eu a ti venno | como moller que se sente<br>\n   de grand' erro que á feito; | mas, Sennor, venna-ch' a mente<br>\n   se che fiz algun serviço, | e guarda-me mia pessõa<br>\n   Atant' é Santa Maria | de toda bondade bõa...  </i></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Afonso writes other othographically interesting things, like <em>non poss' eu perdon gãar</em> for modern Portuguese <em>ganhar</em><sup>[<a href=\"http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/Cantigas_de_Santa_Maria/III\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>]</sup>, or <em>non disse ssi nen non</em><sup>[<a href=\"http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/Cantigas_de_Santa_Maria/CCLXXXIII\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>]</sup>. There we see that Latin <em>sic</em> has for Afonso become <em>ssi</em> without the nasalization marking present in <em>nen</em>, the same word which would become modern Spanish <em>ni</em>, but there unnasalized.</p>\n\n<p>In other places, Afonso uses <em>mi</em> as a prepositional object, which modern Portuguese would spell as <em>mim</em> with final ‹im› to indicate nasalization, despite there never having been an historical dental consonant.  Similarly, as words like <em>mha, mia, mi</em> came to be pronounced with nasalization, these were also reanalysed the way medieval <em>ũa</em> would.  On page 147 of <em>The Romance Languages</em> <sup>[Harris&Vincent; OUP 1990]</sup>, in the section on historical Portuguese morphology, they write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both the articles show abnormal phonetic developments. In the indefinite article, derived from the numeral UNUM, the feminine forms would ordinarily have been denasalised, as ∗[ua], ∗[uas], but retain their nasality, by analogy with the masculine. The modern feminine forms developed in the seventeenth sentury, though glide epenthesesis <em>ũa > ∗uw̃a > uma</em> <strong>possibly influenced by the orthographic form of the masculine,</strong> <em>(h)um</em>.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On page 143, the authors explain that ‹‑m› and ‹‑n› are modern orthographic indicators of nasality, which in earlier days used a tilde, or which were not indicated in the orthography at all. They warn that <strong>“in many cases (e.g. <em>tã</em> = <em>ta(n)</em>?) its interpretation is a matter of dispute between linguists and paleographers.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>So analogous forms of writing nasalized vowels using a following ‹m› in the orthography influenced how nasal vowels would coming to be written as orthography became more regular.  There was no historical nasal consonant left in <em>mea > mha, mia > minha</em>, but it got written that way, and this in turn came to influence the pronunciation.  Similarly, the spellings of <em>mim, sim, assim</em> represent the comparatively recent orthographic invention/convention for writing a <code>[ĩ]</code> there, despite there never having been a nasal consonant present to assimilate. In some cases, there was; in some cases there was not; and in some cases, it is a matter of some dispute just what was actually going on there.</p>\n", "Id":"2357", "ParentId":"2158", "LastEditorUserId":"707", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T16:30:16.067", "OwnerUserId":"707", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-05T19:19:53.060", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"26", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.perl.com/", "Id":"707", "AccountId":"216196", "CreationDate":"2012-01-24T16:28:35.700", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/216196\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/216196.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for tchrist on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for tchrist on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly.
