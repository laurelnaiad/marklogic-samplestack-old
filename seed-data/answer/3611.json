We can deduce what changes <em>have</em> happened (and sometimes experience what changes <em>are</em> happening), and we can certainly conjecture about the phonetic processes involved, but we can never really answer <em>how</em> (or <em>why</em>) questions. </p>\n\n<p>Here, the obvious conjecture is that in that context, the fricative /s/ came to be replaced by a different fricative /f/. In other places the sequence became /ʃr/ or /str/, suggesting that it is often found to be awkward. I also notice that when I pronounce /sr/ I have a tendency to project my lower lip. If I happen to protrude my upper lip a bit, it can become /sfr/ (actually /sφr/, with a bilabial fricative).</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the other examples you give are difficult to understand unless you assume that they went through a fricative stage such as /β/, /ð/ or /ɣ/; then the probable process would again be substitution of the different fricative /f/.</p>\n\n<p>You can see a similar process at work currently in dialects of English where /θ/ (as in <em>think</em>) appears as /f/.</p>\n", "Id":"3611", "ParentId":"3610", "CreationDate":"2013-04-26T09:54:55.557", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"718", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-26T09:54:55.557", "CommentCount":"1"}
