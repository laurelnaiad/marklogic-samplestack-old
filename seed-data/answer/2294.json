{"OwnerDisplayName":"user92", "Body":"<p>The assumption is that \"originally\" each consonant represented only one sound. Indeed, it makes little sense to devise an alphabet were a number of characters are intended to represent two separate consonants. There is some evidence for this, but putting that aside, it is interesting that even if this were so, already in biblical times at least one character indeed represented two sounds, the shin/ sin, which is clearly attested to in the shibboleth story in Judges.</p>\n\n<p>As for p/ ph, it is a good transliteration convention. Although \"f\" and the sound /ph\" are the same in English, only with /ph/ is the relationship with \"p\" apparent. Similarly, this is why it is good sense to use /kh/ for undageshed kaph, and even /bh/ for bet without the dagesh.</p>\n", "Id":"2294", "ParentId":"2292", "CreationDate":"2010-03-28T15:38:14.410", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2010-03-28T15:38:14.410", "comments":[]}
