It occurs even in English (compare <code>lesson</code> vs. <code>lessen</code>).</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this phenomenon is that <em>written forms sometimes evolved faster than phonetics</em>. This was especially noticeable for ancient words that were used in sacral texts and are mostly loanwords from Latin, ancient Greek, or <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/PIE.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">PIE</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>casa</code>, most likely, derived from PIE <code>*kat-</code></li>\n<li><code>leso</code>, from Latin <code>laedere</code></li>\n<li>and so on...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although the written form has lost the original consonants, the missing consonant sounds still remain in phonetic, e.g. <code>*kat+sa</code>, <code>laed+so</code>. Of course, they are diminished and tend to further reducing.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example from Thai language.\nThe word จักร <code>[tɕàk]</code> is borrowed from Sanskrit चक्र <code>[cakra]</code> (\"wheel\"). In most words, it looks like this: จตุจักร [tɕà-tù-tɕàk]. However, in the middle of polysyllabic words, the missing <code>[kra]</code> re-appears as complete syllable: จักรยานยนต์ <code>[tɕàk-krà-yaan-yon]</code> (\"bicycle\").</p>\n\n<p>There is an interesting book discussing <strong>consonant harmony</strong>: Walker, Rachel: Long-distance consonantal identity effects, 2000.</p>\n", "Id":"2261", "ParentId":"1322", "CreationDate":"2012-07-17T09:17:57.720", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-17T09:17:57.720", "CommentCount":"3"}
