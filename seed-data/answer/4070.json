The classifier has no idea how this training data was annotated in this way, it just has the annotation as information and (presumably) information on the classification outcome. In other words, the training data is not transparent to the classifier, it just has to take it as it is.</p>\n", "Id":"4070", "ParentId":"4061", "CreationDate":"2013-07-28T13:42:58.027", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-28T13:42:58.027", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
