{"Body":"<p>You're so close.

The classic example is the German dialects from Bavarian in the far southeast through Frankish and Plattdeutsch to Dutch, where each community can understand the the neighboring community just fine, with no strict boundaries where there is mutual unintelligibility, but at the two extremes (or even halfway) one cannot understand the other.</p>\n\n<p>But this doesn't have to be linear. It has been said that within the continent of Australia, the intelligibility is a neighborhood graph with no two particular endpoints, neighbors understand neighbors on all sides.</p>\n", "Id":"899", "ParentId":"896", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-10-28T13:42:21.420", "OwnerUserId":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-29T21:34:54.253", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-29T21:34:54.253", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"432", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"United States", "Id":"4", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"167219", "Views":"42", "Reputation":"1906", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:24:01.087", "DisplayName":"Mitch", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T11:56:51.610", "AboutMe":"<p>Native speaker of American English (AmE) with touches of Southern AmE.\nProficient in French and German.
