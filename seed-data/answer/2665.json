Drift in this sense is not language-specific but universal, a consensus achieved over two decades by universalists of the typological school as well as the generativist, notably by Greenberg (1960, 1963), Cowgill (1963), Wittmann (1969), Hodge (1970), Giv√≥n (1971), Lakoff (1972), Vennemann (1975) and Reighard (1978).</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2665", "ParentId":"320", "CreationDate":"2012-10-07T03:13:15.560", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"51", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-07T03:13:15.560", "CommentCount":"3"}
