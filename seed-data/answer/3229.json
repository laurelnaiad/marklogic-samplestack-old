If you're going to focus on machine learning, and related techniques, some of the textbooks mentioned in \"<a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1320/looking-for-a-good-beginners-reference-to-learn-computational-linguistics/\">Looking for a good beginners reference to learn computational linguistics</a>\" should cover what you're looking for.</p>\n\n<p>If you're going to focus on logic and semantics, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/L.-T.-F.-Gamut/e/B0034PKWLA/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the two books by L.T.F. Gamut</a> are excellent to begin with. Some researchers who work on formal grammars also use concepts from graph theory and type theory.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from that, you'll probably use concepts from algorithms and complexity theory, the hierarchy of languages, FSM, etc. -- most of which are covered in the book by Jurafsky and Martin.</p>\n\n<p>Based on my own experience, you probably don't need to study any of this before you start your masters. That's what your masters program is meant for anyway. Having had one or two classmates with a background in just mathematics, I'd suggest that you develop competence with some programming language instead; your course might require that you be comfortable with programming already.</p>\n", "Id":"3229", "ParentId":"3226", "CreationDate":"2013-02-19T07:43:24.763", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-19T07:43:24.763", "CommentCount":"1"}
