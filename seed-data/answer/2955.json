{"OwnerDisplayName":"rajah9", "Body":"<p>Thanks for the comments on Heaps’ Law. I followed one of the links to a related law, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herdan%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herdan’s Law</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll quote Wikipedia here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The rule is as follows: if <em>V</em> is the number of different words in the\n  text, and <em>n</em> is the length of the text, then <em>V</em> will be proportional to\n  <em>n</em> to the power <em>β</em>:</p>\n  \n  <h2>        <em>V ∝ nᵝ</em></h2>\n  \n  <p>where <em>β</em> ranges from 0.5 to 1 depending on the text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The equation looks better in one of the stackexchange families that understands equation formatting. My apologies.)</p>\n\n<p>If one takes the conservative <em>β</em> of 0.5, look for a corpus of 10000 words to get you a V proportional to 100 unique words. At <em>β</em> of 0.6, your corpus would be proportional to 2200 words.</p>\n\n<p>=== EDIT: Added real numbers for \"Green Eggs and Ham\" and a couple of CNN articles.</p>\n\n<p>I tested \"Green Eggs and Ham\" and a pair of CNN articles to find the number of unique words.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www-psych.nmsu.edu/~linda/greeneggs/gepage1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Eggs and Ham</a> : 791 words, 55 unique.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/11/politics/fiscal-cliff/index.html?hpt=hp_t2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angry with Obama, GOP threatens political war next year</a> : 1553 words, 573 unique.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/11/world/meast/egypt-unrest/index.html?hpt=wo_c2\" rel=\"nofollow\">New voter rules announced ahead of Egypt referendum</a> : 408 words, 235 unique.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <em>β</em> for these three are 0.600, 0.864, and 0.908. For the second one, I used <em>V = nᵝ</em> and took the log of both sides to solve for <em>β</em>. So <em>β = log(V) / log(n)</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Testing was done in Java. <em>Sam-I-Am</em> counts as a single word, as does <em>decision-making</em>.</p>\n\n<p>=== EDIT: Added graphic for \"Green Eggs and Ham\" </p>\n\n<p>The dependent, x-axis shows the word in the corpus. The independent, y-axis shows the unique count.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/inFkV.png\" alt=\"Green Eggs word count vs unique\"></p>\n", "Id":"2955", "ParentId":"2954", "LastEditorUserId":"225", "CreationDate":"2012-12-10T22:29:51.560", "OwnerUserId":"225", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-12T14:35:50.000", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "Location":"Charlotte, NC", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"225", "AccountId":"239923", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"385", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T13:52:43.483", "DisplayName":"rajah9", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-07T16:34:51.110", "AboutMe":"<p>Contract financial developer at a large bank in Charlotte, NC.</p>\n", "Age":"55"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-12T14:35:50.000", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"13", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "Location":"Charlotte, NC", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"225", "AccountId":"239923", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"385", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T13:52:43.483", "DisplayName":"rajah9", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-07T16:34:51.110", "AboutMe":"<p>Contract financial developer at a large bank in Charlotte, NC.</p>\n", "Age":"55"}}
