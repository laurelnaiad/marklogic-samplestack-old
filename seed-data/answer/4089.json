But you had asked for some scientific evaluation, so here it is.</p>\n\n<p>I came across a paper by Stephanie Lindemann, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1473-4192.2005.00087.x/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">Who speaks “broken English”? US undergraduates’ perceptions of non-native English</a>, that, as the title says, deals with the converse phenomenon. \"respondents were given a list of 58 countries and asked to rate the English of university students from each of these countries on how correct, friendly, and pleasant they found it on a scale of 1 to 10.\" The study covers accents from France, Italy, Germany, Russia, India, Mexico, and China.</p>\n\n<p>Many AmE speakers commented that a Russian accent sounds \"harsh\", \"hard\", \"guttural\", \"very forceful and damaging to the throat\". Does this make a statement about Slavic/Russian itself, or about how Slavic/Russian is <em>perceived</em> by American students? I am, of course, assuming that these perceptions would stay the same whether a Russian is speaking English or speaking Russian.</p>\n", "Id":"4089", "ParentId":"3933", "CreationDate":"2013-07-31T17:09:28.990", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-31T17:09:28.990", "CommentCount":"3"}
