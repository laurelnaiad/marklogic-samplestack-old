{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>One problem is, as you've identified, how to define \"language\". But the much larger problem, which makes your question impossible to answer, is that in order to approach an answer, we need to know the complete number of languages at minimum two distinct times in human history (in order to compare and find the larger number). The only point in time where it's possible to find the number of total languages is today (and we don't even know what that number is). So we will never know the complete number of languages that existed at some point in time in the past. Hence the question cannot be answered.</p>\n", "Id":"3776", "ParentId":"3706", "CreationDate":"2013-05-27T16:56:33.640", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"105", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-27T16:56:33.640", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://folk.uio.no/sverrej/", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"105", "AccountId":"510125", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"289", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T05:45:56.533", "DisplayName":"Sverre", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-09T14:44:26.807", "AboutMe":""}}
