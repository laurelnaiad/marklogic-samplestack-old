{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There are programs that do this. Unless you actually need to do it yourself, you shouldn't. Name entity recognition systems are well developed, and can do an amazing job. If you really need to do it yourself, I would say use one of the free spell checking dictionaries, there are several for linux. Some of these even include a list with conjugations and inflexions, but if you can't find any, you could do the following thing: look up the word in the dictionary, if it doesn't find it, try to match an ending from a list of suffixes to the word, remove the suffix and look again. This method isn't very fast, but I don't see many alternatives.</p>\n", "Id":"3714", "ParentId":"3381", "CreationDate":"2013-05-15T10:44:05.517", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1975", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-15T10:44:05.517", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"6", "Id":"1975", "AccountId":"1705033", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"481", "CreationDate":"2013-04-18T20:07:25.423", "DisplayName":"MGN", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-20T23:49:14.697", "AboutMe":""}}
