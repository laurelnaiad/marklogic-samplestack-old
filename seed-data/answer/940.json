{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The (Modern Standard) Arabic \"qaf\" is an voiceless uvular stop [q]. It is pronounced like a plain [k], except that to make the [q], the back of the tongue touches the uvula, instead of the soft palate (to make [k]).</p>\n\n<p>The Georgian sound is an uvular ejective [q']. It's also pronounced as a voiceless uvular stop, like the Arabic qaf, except that it is an ejective consonant, meaning the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstream_mechanism\">air is created</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant\">pumping the glottis upward</a>. [q], like most of our \"normal\" sounds, is an pulmonic one, meaning the air is created by solely pushing air with the lungs and the diaphragm.</p>\n", "Id":"940", "ParentId":"938", "CreationDate":"2011-11-03T14:18:16.930", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"92", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-03T14:18:16.930", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
