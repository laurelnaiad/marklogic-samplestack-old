{"Body":"<p>I believe that Sandiway Fong has made at least one principles &amp; parameters parser, which might be old enough to have proper x-bar structure. There aren't many in that area doing computational linguistics, but probably the big name is Robert Berwick, so you might want to look at some of his work as well.</p>\n\n<p>In response to another reply: Some popular versions of transformational grammars would be factorial time (based on number of words in a sentence), at least in the worst case, if they were implemented. Many who work in that line don't consider that important, because they don't consider what they do to be a model of performance but purely a model of knowledge. But not everyone buys that. See <a href=\"http://bit.ly/odEcTC\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>, for example. But I don't think the main culprit is x-bar theory. The main problem is global economy conditions, which in some models require the syntax to generate many permutations of a given sentence and then evaluate them after the fact.</p>\n", "Id":"43", "ParentId":"31", "LastEditorUserId":"71", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:24:31.057", "OwnerUserId":"71", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-15T02:25:31.083", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"21", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Tucson, AZ", "Id":"71", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"158152", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"554", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T22:53:16.427", "DisplayName":"Alan H.", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-08T15:51:29.733", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-15T02:25:31.083", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"21", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Tucson, AZ", "Id":"71", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"158152", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"554", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T22:53:16.427", "DisplayName":"Alan H.", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-08T15:51:29.733", "AboutMe":""}}
