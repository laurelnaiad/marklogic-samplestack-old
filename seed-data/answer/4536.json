{"Body":"<p>Although they do sound a bit odd and stilted, I personally have no trouble accepting <code>1b</code> and <code>2b</code>. I think your problem is that you aren't making a distinction between <em>unacceptable</em> and <em>weird</em> or <em>awkward</em>. Humans judge utterances based on several criteria; of course syntax and semantics but also stylistic factors and even ease of comprehension. In my [limited] experience, these are considered as extra-linguistic factors and not including in an utterances acceptability unless explicitly noted.</p>\n\n<p>Note how <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> use embedded clauses (<code>guy behind me</code> and <code>whose hand he was holding</code>, respectively) while <code>3</code> doesn't. Also note how in the <code>a</code> versions the embedded clauses come at the end of the sentence while in <code>b</code> they come in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>I unfortunately cannot find an academic source addressing this exact issue, embedding clauses in the middle of a sentence <a href=\"http://www.primaryschoolscience.com/literacy/lit-complex.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">causes difficulty because the reader needs to figure out where the embedded clause ends</a>. When the embedded clause comes at the end of the sentence it is trivial to see where it ends. I suspect that you, like me, don't consider <code>1b</code> and <code>2b</code> as <em>wrong</em> so much as <em>harder to parse</em> compared to <code>1a</code> and <code>2a</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I was able to find <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_embedding\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiple sources</a> for <a href=\"http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/33540/34310145.pdf?sequence=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">how embedding can affect understandability</a> but they describe different types of embedding from the one in your question.</p>\n", "Id":"4536", "ParentId":"4535", "LastEditorUserId":"1055", "CreationDate":"2013-09-24T02:00:00.500", "OwnerUserId":"1055", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-26T00:01:03.793", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"102", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Seoul, South Korea", "Id":"1055", "DownVotes":"9", "AccountId":"1453460", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"1947", "CreationDate":"2012-05-29T05:50:57.073", "DisplayName":"acattle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:59:41.983", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently studying for an MA in Computational Linguistics even though my background is not in linguistics.
