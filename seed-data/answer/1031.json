One point made by Croft in his book \"Radical Construction Grammar,\" however, is that it is in general possible to analyze a language so that it has whatever number of lexical categories you like, so at a close level of scrutiny it is hard to motivate such claims as \"Language X does not distinguish nouns and verbs.\"</p>\n\n<p>Outside of lexicalization patterns, there are some decidedly non-IE patterns which are documented in high quality descriptions of various languages.
