As mentioned in <a href=\"http://linguistlist.org/issues/7/7-826.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Linguist List discussion on Nettle 1995</a>, Maori has a very limited segment inventory and their words are quite short. </p>\n\n<p>One possible reason is that the metric of word length (either by segment or syllables) varies with morphosyntactic variability. A language may form predicates by using light verbs/phrases consisting of short words (dance -> do a fun move), in which case neither phonemic diversity nor <em>word</em> length are crucial components. It's also a methodological question what is measured by mean word length.</p>\n\n<p>Syllable count can be a worse measure than word length because languages differ in how complex a syllable can be. A language with only open syllables (\"sa\") will need more segmental variety to convey the same amount of information with monosyllables than a language which allows complex onsets and codas (\"sploink\").</p>\n", "Id":"1618", "ParentId":"1617", "LastEditorUserId":"397", "CreationDate":"2012-03-12T01:12:02.740", "OwnerUserId":"397", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-13T21:21:54.033", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"50", "DownVotes":"86", "Id":"397", "AccountId":"959564", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"680", "CreationDate":"2011-10-07T14:54:31.260", "DisplayName":"Aerlinthe", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-10T17:42:44.790"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-13T21:21:54.033", "Score":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"50", "DownVotes":"86", "Id":"397", "AccountId":"959564", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"680", "CreationDate":"2011-10-07T14:54:31.260", "DisplayName":"Aerlinthe", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-10T17:42:44.790"}}
