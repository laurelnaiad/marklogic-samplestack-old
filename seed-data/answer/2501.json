{"comments":[], "Body":"<p><em>Ah</em> or <em>ach</em> may be an easy interjection for many languages to come to, but it is in no way an onomatopoeia. An onomatopoeia is an imitation of a sound and <em>ah</em> imitates nothing, therefore it is not an onomatopoeia. Block is unfortunately wrong to use that word. If, in fact, you could produce scholarship that shows the origin of that Hebrew interjection coming from imitating an animal, an object dropping, etc. then that would be a different - and very interesting - story.</p>\n", "Id":"2501", "ParentId":"2464", "CreationDate":"2012-09-01T04:28:16.793", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1298", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-01T04:28:16.793", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://imagininglanguage.wordpress.com", "Id":"1298", "AccountId":"1139230", "CreationDate":"2012-09-01T04:07:18.940", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm in my last year of undergrad linguistics at Ohio State.</p>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"121", "DisplayName":"Michael Billips", "LastAccessDate":"2012-09-01T04:38:16.170"}}
