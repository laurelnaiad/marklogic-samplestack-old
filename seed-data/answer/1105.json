What's going on in <em>treat</em> is technically called <strong>Affrication</strong>, i.e, the initial, voiceless, aspirated /t/ and the following voiceless retroflex /r/ are joining together as an affricate, just like /tʃ/ in <em>cheat</em>. And why does <em>treat</em> sound so much like <em>cheat</em>?</p>\n\n<p>The key is the fact that initial voiceless stops in English /p t tʃ k/ are <strong>aspirated</strong>. This means they get a little puff of air when they're pronounced. This is quite automatic but very easy to perceive, and the aspiration merges with the /r/, which is already voiceless because it's following a voiceless stop, and the result does sound very much like /tʃ/. It's possible to distinguish them, but we often can choose which one to \"hear\", in context.</p>\n\n<p>Note that English doesn't use /r/ after /tʃ/ or /dʒ/, though it occurs after all other stops; try pronouncing \"chree\" so that it doesn't sound like \"tree\", and you'll see. The palatal affricates behave otherwise like normal stop consonants; this restriction on /r/ clusters is because palatals are too close to /r/ in the mouth for us to distinguish easily. This is a common situation in many languages.</p>\n\n<p>In Mandarin, for instance, which has contrastive <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/Pinyin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palatal and Retroflex stop series</a> (in Pinyin, palatal stops are all single letters <em>j</em>, <em>q</em>, and <em>x</em>, while retroflex stops are two-letter combinations with a second letter <em>h</em>), hearing and pronouncing the distinctions between them is always a challenge for English speakers.</p>\n\n<p>In English, however, we only have the one retroflex consonant /r/ (which you can represent as /ɹ/ if you feel it's required), and /r/ is unique phonetically, and famously variable in different English dialects as well.</p>\n", "Id":"1105", "ParentId":"1104", "CreationDate":"2011-12-01T22:21:50.967", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-01T22:21:50.967", "CommentCount":"3"}
