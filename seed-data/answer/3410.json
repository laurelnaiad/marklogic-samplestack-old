{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It looks as if the courses you intend to take are introductory courses, so it's not likely that you need too much background knowledge. If so, you should be set just reading <em>one</em> introductory book to linguistics, which will cover the basics of all the subdisciplines in linguistics. There are many books to choose from here. Some of them are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) Edward Finegan: Language: Its Structure and Use.</p>\n  \n  <p>b) William O'Grady et al.: Contemporary Linguistics.</p>\n  \n  <p>c) Victoria Fromkin et al.: An Introduction to Language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My personal recommendation is Fromkin et al. \"Linguistics: An Introduction\" from 2001. It's not printed anymore, but you can get it at Amazon. It covers only the main fields of linguistics: Syntax, Semantics &amp; Pragmatics, and Phonology. And it does so very well. It aims a little higher than the basic introductory textbooks mentioned above.</p>\n", "Id":"3410", "ParentId":"3344", "CommunityOwnedDate":"2013-03-21T14:55:39.717", "CreationDate":"2013-03-21T14:55:39.717", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"105", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-21T14:55:39.717", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://folk.uio.no/sverrej/", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"105", "AccountId":"510125", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"289", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T05:45:56.533", "DisplayName":"Sverre", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-09T14:44:26.807", "AboutMe":""}}
