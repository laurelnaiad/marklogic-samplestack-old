However, I think I can get at an answer, and perhaps help you clean your question up a bit.</p>\n\n<p>For a while, semanticists thought that our vocabulary was arranged in a logical, hierarchical way. Nouns are arranged so that they fall under each other, with 'sparrow' coming under 'bird' coming under 'animal' coming under 'life' coming under 'thing'. Something similar takes place for verbs. This is a very optimistic vision of semantics, as it implies that our brains work in a very logical, ordered way.</p>\n\n<p>However, this turns out to be false. There are a number of classic experiments that can be performed that demonstrate this. For instance, you could show people names of different things and ask them to say if they are a bird or not. If you time their responses, you find that people are quicker to respond when shown typical birds, like 'sparrow', then they are  for 'ostriche' or 'penguin'. This was taken to show that our semantic structure was a web, with archetypical words at the center and less \"fitting\" words further out.</p>\n\n<p>Another experimental paradigm is priming. We show the subject a series of word and nonce words, such as \"blurg\" and ask them to determine whether or not they are words. We can prime a subject's response for a particular word, that is, decrease their response time, by showing them a related word before. For instance, if I show you \"salt\" and then \"pepper\", your response for \"pepper\" will be faster than if I had previously shown you 'President'.\nCross-modal priming is when you prime someone for a written word by saying a related word, or vis-versa.</p>\n\n<p>You can get really fancy with ERP (event related potential) experiments and fMRI scans and the like, and talk about activation patterns in the brain, but as far as your question goes we don't really need to. </p>\n", "Id":"757", "ParentId":"756", "CreationDate":"2011-10-10T01:28:15.527", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"350", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-10T01:28:15.527", "CommentCount":"5"}
