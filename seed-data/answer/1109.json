{"Body":"<p>I think that the basic observation about agglutinative languages generally not having complex tonal systems is pretty well upheld. In languages where morphemes are generally segmentable, and words are long, tonal systems will be found, as in many languages of North and South America, also some Oceanic language of New Caledonia; but languages with the most complex tonal systems, in Southern Mexico, Equatorial Africa and SE Asia, tend to have short words. This is not to say that such languages do not have much morphology; it's just that the morphology tends to be non-concatentive. </p>\n\n<p>My guess for why this is is that the historical processes leading to very complex tonal systems tend to require short words as their endpoint. In Africa, languages having the most complex tonal systems (with four or five contrasts of pitch level at the surface) have gotten to be this way because syllables get lost, but their tones stay behind, causing perturbations. The more lost syllables, the more complex the tonal system, and the shorter the words. </p>\n\n<p>In SE Asian tone systems, the systems have gotten complex due to pitch perturbations caused by the combined effects of word-initial <em>and</em> word-final consonants, so getting to the most complex system requires starting out with short words. Effects of consonants on pitch have created or complicated tonal systems in languages already having relatively long words, like Cherokee or New Caledonia languages, but the systems don't seem to get to the point where four and five pitch-levels are contrasted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some references</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Haudricourt, A.-G.
