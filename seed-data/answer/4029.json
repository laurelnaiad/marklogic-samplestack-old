{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>You are talking about <em>mental design</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at Esperanto, and its initial creator, the <em>non-linguist</em> Zamenhof. He actually took years playing with notions (not entirely alone), and there are many ideas in the language, that are worth essaying on. For instance endings -a (adj), -e (adv), -o (n) and suffixes -in- -ist- -ebl- have the feature starting with a vowel, so they are chainable.</p>\n\n<p>Unknown to many, even Esperanto speakers, Zamenhof first played with a proto-version, trying out other vowels for endings. Though the pronunciation of \"..io\" more involves a stop than a y transition, he refrained from \"..ijo..\".</p>\n\n<p>Zamenhof also chose very short consonant cut-off monosylabic digits (except for 1): unu du tri <em>kvar</em> _kvin_ ses <em>sep</em> _ok_ na≈≠ <em>dek</em>. This helps with counting (aloud), an area where a foreign speaker often reverts to his native language.</p>\n\n<p>So a commitee not necessarily is better suited for such initial design work. The large manco of Esperanto is its undocumentedness. And - beside the more passive Akademio de Esperanto - one would have hoped for more productive linguistic commitees.</p>\n\n<p>Consider Interlingua, which is linguistically based, and community oriented. The language has other merits, but I find its concept certainly not better funded. I would rather delve into Lingua Franca Nova; but I am very biased to my Esperanto.</p>\n", "Id":"4029", "ParentId":"3898", "CreationDate":"2013-07-19T11:49:53.710", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1611", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-19T11:49:53.710", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1611", "AccountId":"960307", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"181", "CreationDate":"2012-12-26T17:41:32.873", "DisplayName":"Joop Eggen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T17:34:00.430", "AboutMe":"<p>Speaking Esperanto, Dutch, English, German.</p>\n"}}
