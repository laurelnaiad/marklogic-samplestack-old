{"Body":"<p>Phonetics isn't my forte but I might offer some help. </p>\n\n<p>I am aware of at least two theories that try to explain why certain sounds are more wide-spread than others. The first one is called <strong>Quantal Theory</strong>, proposed by <a href=\"http://www.rle.mit.edu/rleonline/People/KennethN.Stevens.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kenneth Stevens</a> (1972, 1989, 2002, <em>inter alia</em>). There are regions of stability in the articulatory to acoustics mapping (aka quantal regions), when changes in articulation have little impact on acoustics. Sounds that occupy those stable regions tend to be more common in languages. Have a look at <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/class/linguist205/index_files/Handout%208%20-%20QT%20&amp;%20Adaptive%20Dispersion.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this handout</a></p>\n\n<p>The other one is called <strong>Adaptive Dispersion</strong>, first proposed by Liljencrants &amp; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_E._Lindblom\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lindblom</a> (1972) (the <a href=\"http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/qpsr/1971/1971_12_1_050-050.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">1971 working paper version</a> can be downloaded for free). Its basic tenet is that sounds in a language tend to be placed in such a way so that perceptual (auditory) contrast between them is at maximum.
