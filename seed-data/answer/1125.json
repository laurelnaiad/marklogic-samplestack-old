Splitting doesn't look as nice, but Japanese readers know to keep reading, if that makes sense. You do not insert a hyphen or anything like that (as you would in many Latin script languages). The same applies to Japanese kanji compounds. Also, do not start a line with punctuation.</p>\n\n<p>Best practice: have a Japanese speaker suggest where to split as all the kana characters after a kanji do not necessarily belong with that kanji.</p>\n", "Id":"1125", "ParentId":"1124", "CreationDate":"2011-12-07T16:45:31.030", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"575", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-07T16:45:31.030", "CommentCount":"4"}
