{"Body":"<p>That this currently isn't a field with much revenue (except maybe movie languages) or practical use associated with it has already been mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>I think there is a throwing-out-the-baby-with-the-bath-water dynamic going on with the following triggers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Crackpots. They exist in the conlang community and seem to be over-represented. Examples include aUi, by John Weilgart. All fields have crackpots, but some fields attract crackpots more than others.  Weilgart said he got the inspiration for the language from (real) space aliens. This differs from say, Klingon, where the participants know they are real Trek fans and the aliens are fictional.</p></li>\n<li><p>Auxlang promoters. Auxlang promoters, in the hopes of gaining followers, make wild claims, in particular claims about ease of learning, cultural neutrality and global utopia (or at least some substantive move in that direction).</p></li>\n<li><p>Historical philosophical languages turned out to be a dead end as languages and lines of thought. The languages hoped to allow the universe ideas to be divided into hierarchal categories and additive \"compound words\" in the lexicon and for the grammar to follow some sort of \"natural\" syntax, i.e. little thought was given to syntax. e.g. John Wilkins's language, although it did inspire Roget's thesaurus. It didn't prove to be more useful (or at least, not more popular) than natural languages for discussing the world or philosophy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Loglans (like lojban) promised to allow people to say what they mean and people would hear what that person meant. In other words, remove ambiguity in speech. In practice, loglans removed syntactic ambiguity for people who are good at mentally parsing like a machine parser, but left a lot of room for misunderstanding and semantic ambiguity. Loglans also promised to possibly be a way to communicate with machines, possibly for artificial intelligence applications. While a machine can parse lojban, I don't know of any implementations of a \"run time\" that does anything interesting with the parsed values (say, querying a store of lojban encoded facts, similar to how Prolog words).  This doesn't mean loglans are useless, it is just another conlang that didn't deliver on the original promises.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And there is a scholar out there who wrote some remarkably hostile pychoanalytic-like analysis of the mental states of those who create/use artificial languages. I'm really sorry I can't find it.</p>\n\n<p>With red flags like the above, I wouldn't be surprised if people see the field as sort of a quest to square the circle, create a perpetual motion machine, or the like.</p>\n\n<p>I don't agree with them myself. In the field of languages for the profoundly disabled, such as deaf-blind, new things that look like languages are being invented by health care providers and they are doing a so-so or lousy job of it because they don't have any scientific rigor and methodology behind them.</p>\n", "Id":"2682", "ParentId":"2670", "LastEditorUserId":"20", "CreationDate":"2012-10-11T19:27:30.467", "OwnerUserId":"20", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-01T13:57:50.690", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"72", "WebsiteUrl":"http://suburbandestiny.com/conlang", "Id":"20", "AccountId":"15651", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:53:42.550", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programmer by day and an amateur linguist by night.</p>\n\n<p>I organize the Arlington Linguistics Book Club, where we read a wide variety of books that make the science of linguistic accessible to a popular audience.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"6", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"1657", "DisplayName":"MatthewMartin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:46:09.130"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-01T13:57:50.690", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"72", "WebsiteUrl":"http://suburbandestiny.com/conlang", "Id":"20", "AccountId":"15651", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:53:42.550", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programmer by day and an amateur linguist by night.</p>\n\n<p>I organize the Arlington Linguistics Book Club, where we read a wide variety of books that make the science of linguistic accessible to a popular audience.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"6", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"1657", "DisplayName":"MatthewMartin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:46:09.130"}}
