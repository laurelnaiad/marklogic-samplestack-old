{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ethnologue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethnologue</a> is a common source of reference for language classification and documentation. It uses the ISO 639-3 standard, which classifies languages using a three-letter coding system. The basic criteria that Ethnologue uses to identify languages (as opposed to, for example, dialects) are (i) mutual intelligibility between speakers of variants of a language; and (ii) existence of a common literature or of a common ethnolinguistic identity. The criterion for including a language in the ethnologue is that it must be “known to have living speakers who learned [it] by transmission from parent to child as the primary language of day-to-day communication”. </p>\n", "Id":"3481", "ParentId":"3300", "CreationDate":"2013-04-02T00:23:38.800", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1924", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-02T00:23:38.800", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1924", "AccountId":"1799708", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"113", "CreationDate":"2013-04-02T00:13:01.717", "DisplayName":"Kevin C", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-07T03:27:29.563"}}
