{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There isn't any phonetic basis that captures all the various R sounds.  A rhotic is considered such based on phonological factors, i.e. rhotics pattern in similar ways across languages.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the same segment could be a rhotic in one language and non-rhotic in another.  For example, as you may be familiar with, in North American dialects an alveolar stop often becomes an alveolar flap invervocalically after a stressed syllable (e.g. \"ladder\").  An alveolar flap/tap is also used in many other languages as an R.  So that seems to be some evidence that there's no phonetic factor that will make a segment inherently rhotic.</p>\n\n<p>Rhotics are a relatively poorly understood group of segments.</p>\n", "Id":"1270", "ParentId":"1268", "CreationDate":"2012-01-13T03:55:05.270", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"667", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-13T03:55:05.270", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"667", "AccountId":"897918", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"328", "CreationDate":"2012-01-13T03:55:05.270", "DisplayName":"Askalon", "LastAccessDate":"2012-07-04T22:20:47.023"}}
