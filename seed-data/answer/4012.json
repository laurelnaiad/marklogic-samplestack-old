{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Zamenhof borrowed and made up the first batch of words. He encouraged people to Esperantize words from their mother tongue if they didn't know a word. So from the beginning, there wasn't a central source of authority for new words. This contrasts with other new languages, such as Klingon, toki pona, Tolkien's Elivish, where the stock of root words is limited by the number of words the inventor published. (Derivational creation of words is pretty much unavoidable, even in isolating languages)  This doesn't stop people from creating new words, but coining new root words aren't part of the \"game\" in those community.  This is analogous to the rule about having 52 cards in a standard playing card deck-- you can create a new one, but community standards, existing rules of the game don't encourage it and it doesn't happen in practice.</p>\n\n<p>Now that there are native Esperanto speakers, the language is evolving much like any other natural language.  I think there is a language board for Esperanto, I'm not sure if it attempts to create new words (like the French one does) or if it is effective at that.</p>\n", "Id":"4012", "ParentId":"4009", "CreationDate":"2013-07-15T17:13:46.743", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"20", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-15T17:13:46.743", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"72", "WebsiteUrl":"http://suburbandestiny.com/conlang", "Id":"20", "AccountId":"15651", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:53:42.550", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programmer by day and an amateur linguist by night.</p>\n\n<p>I organize the Arlington Linguistics Book Club, where we read a wide variety of books that make the science of linguistic accessible to a popular audience.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"6", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"1657", "DisplayName":"MatthewMartin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:46:09.130"}}
