{"Body":"<p>I think that the \"thinking language\" is just the language that you use to speak.\nIf you have lived, for example, in Italy for a long time, independently of your age, you start to think in Italian for sure. So it is for children, unless the family and context language is different.\nAlso the \"dreaming language\" is relevant, but changes earlier.</p>\n\n<p>The \"thinking language\" is not the act of thinking, it's only the act of speaking to yourself to improve the thinking process. You can also force yourself to use a different language in this process.</p>\n\n<p>An example, Kobe Bryant is a fluent Italian speaker because he did a large part of primary school in Italy, but I'm pretty sure that he thought in English during that period.</p>\n", "Id":"3731", "ParentId":"3709", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-05-17T12:43:14.573", "OwnerUserId":"2074", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-22T16:39:10.707", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-22T16:39:10.707", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/pH4J5.jpg", "Id":"2074", "AccountId":"2659791", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2013-05-17T12:42:23.773", "DisplayName":"FdT", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-14T17:47:12.937"}}
