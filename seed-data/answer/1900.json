{"Body":"<p>My thinking on this is as follows. Whispering in regular languages isn't usually semantically or phonemically salient. It's almost always just a modulation of speech in compensation for the physical or social environment. For this reason it's not transcribed in phonetic notation, just like shouting is usually not transcribed. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes whispering can be phonetically salient, though. This is rarely if ever the case as part of a language's sound system, so there hasn't been any need to notate it much. </p>\n\n<p>Now, whispering is <em>definitely</em> phonetically salient is in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disorder\" rel=\"nofollow\">study of speech disorder</a>s. Dysphonation of various types is found among those with disordered speech. This includes inappropriate whispered, creaky, faucalized, unvoiced, mouthed, etc. phonations, ingressive airstreams, etc. Fascinatingly, though the <a href=\"https://clispi.org/userfiles/ExtIPAChart2002.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extensions to the IPA</a>[PDF] do not actually include a mechanism for indicating whispered phonation! Wikipedia says they do, but it's not clear to me that this is actually true. </p>\n\n<p>The IPA does include a variety of diacritics for phonation types, but whisper is not included.</p>\n", "Id":"1900", "ParentId":"1890", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "CreationDate":"2012-05-08T17:21:59.083", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-08T17:32:44.017", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-08T17:32:44.017", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
