{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>If you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment, the best book is to start with Is Fromkin, Introduction to language.  It provides a general introduction to syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, pragmatics and brain and language. It is easy to read. I really advise you to start with it. </p>\n\n<p>For syntax, you can read Andrew Carney's Syntax: a generative introduction. Hageman's introduction to government and binding. Redford's Minimalist syntax. I have benefited from these books a lot and i advice you to read them in this order. </p>\n\n<p>For phonology, you should read Oddey's Introducing phonology. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck</p>\n", "Id":"3409", "ParentId":"3344", "CommunityOwnedDate":"2013-03-20T17:13:11.893", "CreationDate":"2013-03-20T17:13:11.893", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1469", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-20T17:13:11.893", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"12", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1469", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7wMvF.jpg", "AccountId":"2013296", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"172", "CreationDate":"2012-11-05T19:59:04.463", "DisplayName":"Dariya", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T23:25:52.387", "AboutMe":""}}
