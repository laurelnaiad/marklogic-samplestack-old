{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>For language internal issues, <strong>vocabulary</strong>, because of its unbounded scale, is the primary barrier to foreign language understanding. Having lots of cognates (like between English and Romance languages for educated communication) helps immensely. The lack of cognates between English and Japanese (despite the minimal borrowings each way) might account for difficulty in understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Externally, it is cultural factors that are the primary barrier that limit language understanding. Extensive media, intermarriage, accepted lingua franca, prestige and privilege, enforcement, etc. all increase the use of a language and therefore understanding. Media is about the only one of these that works in favor of English in Japan, and <strong>media and prestige</strong> of English is higher (I guess) in Scandinavia.</p>\n\n<p>The question is somewhat vague (is it about a generally accepted perception of Japanese people vs Scandinavians, or is the a quantitative analysis behind it (number of EFL speakers per capita plus proficiency) or what. Just accepting the hypothesis that Scandinavians are 'better' at English than the Japanese, I would speculate that it has little to do with the language itself/linguistic principles, but rather that Scandinavians have a higher incentive to learn English than the Japanese have (relative populations, economic strength, job opportunities).</p>\n", "Id":"1218", "ParentId":"1208", "CreationDate":"2011-12-31T16:54:05.297", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"4", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-31T16:54:05.297", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"432", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"United States", "Id":"4", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"167219", "Views":"42", "Reputation":"1906", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:24:01.087", "DisplayName":"Mitch", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T11:56:51.610", "AboutMe":"<p>Native speaker of American English (AmE) with touches of Southern AmE.\nProficient in French and German.
