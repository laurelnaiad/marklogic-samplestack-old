{"Body":"<p>The most frequently-cited work on this topic is probably Maddieson (1984) (see also Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson 1996), and the associated <a href=\"http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid.html\">UPSID database</a>, from which you can get frequency data for different types of contrastive sounds in languages. Taking a diachronic perspective, we can say that rare sounds are those which tend to get easily lost in sound change, because they are difficult to produce or perceive, and those for which there are few pathways for their innovation (even if they are not difficult to produce, they just require very specific conditions to arise). </p>\n\n<p>An interesting discussion of aerodynamic factors influencing the prevalence of different types of stop consonants is found in <a href=\"http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/macn83.pdf\">Ohala (1983)</a>; a proposal for the rarity of bilabial trills is found in <a href=\"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/52014440.pdf\">Maddieson (1989: 91--115)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Ladefoged &amp; Ian Maddieson (1996). <a href=\"http://books.google.com.br/books?id=h1byJz_rWUcC\">The sounds of the world's languages</a>.
