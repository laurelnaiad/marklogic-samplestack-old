[...] when one does get a hold of a grammar of an\n  Amazonian language it is likely to show strange properties - multiple\n  sets of classifiers, oddly conditioned ergativity splits, and so on -\n  that constitute exceptions to received ideas about typological\n  universals. In other instances one finds the richest examples of\n  categories that are weakly attested elsewhere. For instance, Tucano\n  languages have the most highly articulated systems of evidentiality in\n  the world; this is an obligatory specification of the evidence a\n  speaker has for making a statement - whether observed, or reported, or\n  inferred, or assumed. However, a major difficulty is that a high\n  proportion of available grammars are incomplete, affording a glimpse\n  of some exotic grammatical property but with insufficient information\n  to enable the reader to fuly understand it, and to realize its overall\n  typological significance.
