{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The question title asks for ways of defining a writer's unique style, but the body indicates that the aim is to identify authors based on analysis of their writings. The identification of authors based on analysis of their style, known as 'authorship attribution', does not necessarily allow for characterising a 'unique style' as it may be more about statistical differences rather than unique styles. This means that while a human reader may not be able to guess that two pieces were by different authors, statistical calculations based on various measures may be able to detect this with a fair degree of certainty.</p>\n\n<p>Authorship attribution has a long tradition, particularly in theological studies and philology, but has developed many new methods with the advent of natural language processing. Many different metrics have been employed in authorship attribution, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>word length</li>\n<li>sentence length</li>\n<li>character frequencies</li>\n<li>word frequencies</li>\n<li>vocabulary richness (various functions)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's not possible to list all measures as it has been estimated (Rudman, 1998) that over 1,000 different measures had been developed up to that point.</p>\n\n<p>Some useful references are listed below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.icsd.aegean.gr/lecturers/stamatatos/papers/survey.pdf\">A survey of modern authorship attribution methods</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/E/E99/E99-1021.pdf\">Automatic authorship attribution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~sok/papers/r/s004.html\">The state of authorship attribution studies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=6&amp;num=1&amp;id=136\">Comparative Power of Three Author-Attribution Techniques for Differentiating Authors</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"1838", "ParentId":"1397", "CreationDate":"2012-04-22T08:36:32.847", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-22T08:36:32.847", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ãœmlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}}
