This term appears in other Romance Languages as well: <em>It</em>. saluto, <em>Es.</em> saludo.</p>\n\n<p>The meaning which is <em>health, well-being</em>, is carried out also by other descendants: <em>It.</em> salute, <em>Es.</em> salud, <em>Port.</em> saúde.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think there is a connection to <strong>salaam</strong> which actually means <em>peace</em> in Arabic (I think you can confirm this meaning) and is related to the term <strong>shalom</strong> in Hebrew. You can find more about this on the Wikipedia page for <strong>Shin-Lamedh-Mem</strong>, the <em>\"the triconsonantal root of many Semitic words\"</em>, at the section <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0-L-M#Salam_.22Peace.22\">Salam \"Peace\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the same page, this <em>\"root itself translates as whole, safe, intact\"</em>, but the triconsonantal part refers to the Š-L-M, while in salut we miss the last one and we have a T instead. </p>\n\n<p>There seems to be a real closeness in terms of meanings which could be a coincidence. Still, this is just a superficial analysis and I don't have all the tools/resources to absolutely exclude a link.</p>\n", "Id":"3209", "ParentId":"3208", "CreationDate":"2013-02-16T21:02:24.483", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"111", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-16T21:02:24.483", "CommentCount":"15"}
