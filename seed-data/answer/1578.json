IPA can, just as any other alphabet, be used for both phonetic and phonemic transcription (the difference has already been neatly explained), or anything in between. One might argue IPA is richer, poorer, more or less readable, flexible, regular, whatever, but in principle there is nothing in it, or any other alphabet, that forces you to use it at any particular level of abstraction. Alphabet and level of abstraction are two independent variables.</p>\n", "Id":"1578", "ParentId":"301", "CreationDate":"2012-03-06T09:35:12.420", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"794", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-06T09:35:12.420", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}}
