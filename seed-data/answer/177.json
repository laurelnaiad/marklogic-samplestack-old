{"comments":[], "Body":"<p><a href=\"http://webscript.princeton.edu/~ahesterb/puzzles.php\">http://webscript.princeton.edu/~ahesterb/puzzles.php</a>: I bumped into this website somehow or another when I had only a minor interest in linguistics. It has a pretty good set of exercises over a wide range of skill levels. Most of the problems are significantly easier than the ones for the international linguistics olympiad, though toward the end, some were about the same difficulty, so I think it would be a good starting point! </p>\n", "Id":"177", "ParentId":"87", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T19:04:19.153", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"129", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-15T19:04:19.153", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"45", "Location":"North Carolina", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"129", "AccountId":"403878", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"156", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T17:18:16.513", "DisplayName":"Nathan Ellenfield", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-05T16:25:37.980"}}
