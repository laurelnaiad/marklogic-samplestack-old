{"Body":"<p>The eldest form of this word (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khagan\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khagan</a>) had been rendered in Chinese chronicles as Kehan (可寒, The Great Cold; later as 可汗, The Mighty Sweat). The title referred then to the ruler of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xianbei</a> tribe. The language of that tribe was agglutinative and, presumably, proto-Mongolian.</p>\n\n<p>The title is not to be mistaken for the '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rus%27_Khaganate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russian Kagan</a>', which actually is a Russian rendering of Swedish haakan (håkan), a.k.a. hawk (hence, Russian ´yasny sockol´, or ´the bright hawk' used as a form of address in Russian folklore narrated texts). </p>\n\n<p>The thing is even more complicated by the fact that there had been a real Bulgarian Kaganate near Volga (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Bulgaria\" rel=\"nofollow\">Volga Bulgaria,</a> which later adopted Islam).</p>\n\n<p>The titles of Khagan and Khan had been used simultaneously as early as by 4th / 6th centuries, by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouran_Khaganate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rouran</a> people (in Mingolian, the Nirun).</p>\n\n<p>So my intuition is that the Khagan is a Bulgaric adoptation of the Occidental word Haakan (Håkan), while Khan is an authentic 'Oriental' term. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baekje</a> word for Khan is Ke (瑕), The Fault. </p>\n\n<p>My opinion is that these two words are different, although they seem to be similar.</p>\n", "Id":"6148", "ParentId":"6141", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-12-14T18:34:10.197", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-16T11:07:56.307", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
