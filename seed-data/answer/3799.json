I'm interested in bi-lingualism, social variation, anthropological linguistics and blog about all on MetaphorHacker.net.</p>\n\n<p>I've also been involved in teaching foreign languages and teacher training. I've taught Czech to foreigners and co-written a grammar and textbook (see Czechly.com) and I've worked as a regional language specialist for the US Peace Corps. I've also been the academic director of a private TEFL teacher training school.</p>\n"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>You may want to have a look at OpenNLP <a href=\"http://opennlp.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opennlp.apache.org/</a>. It's in JAVA but it does have a parsing component. It is supposed to be available across languages but you may have to train it. Frankly, I haven't used it for anything myself so would be interested in hearing whether it is useful for an application like yours.</p>\n", "Id":"3799", "ParentId":"3784", "CreationDate":"2013-06-03T09:07:34.873", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2121", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-03T09:07:34.873", "CommentCount":"1"}
