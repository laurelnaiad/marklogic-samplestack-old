{"Body":"<p>A quick search of <strong>جید</strong> on Google returned two relevant results.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forvo.com/word/%D8%AC%DB%8C%D8%AF/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The first one</a> is a pronunciation of the word by an Egyptian speaker,\nwhere it is pronounced with a plosive-velar [g].\n<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%AF\" rel=\"nofollow\">the second result</a> is a Wiktionary entry of that word where the pronunciation is with a velar [j].</p>\n\n<p>Given the fact that Arabic has many (many!) dialects, it's not surprising to see a word, even a \"basic\" one, being pronounced differently in different cultures and societies. In fact the difference only in the manner of pronunciation indicates that one of the consonants is an allophone of the other and not a case of borrowing the whole word.</p>\n\n<p>The close relations to Hebrew can also help to shed light here, the Hebrew word for good <strong>טוב (tov)</strong> is very similar to  the Arabic word <strong>tayyib (طَيِّب)</strong> which also means good, and from there the jump to jayyid or gayyid is not very far.</p>\n\n<p>I might not be a professional, or any sort of authority in this matter, but it seems to me that a language borrowing a single word is less likely do so if the word already exists in the borrowing language, especially a fairly common and \"basic\" word like good.</p>\n", "Id":"3267", "ParentId":"3238", "LastEditorUserId":"1785", "CreationDate":"2013-02-24T11:24:07.907", "OwnerUserId":"1785", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-24T16:46:48.290", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OH70F.jpg", "Id":"1785", "AccountId":"2298473", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"99", "CreationDate":"2013-02-20T13:20:27.513", "DisplayName":"Lson", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-31T16:43:20.417"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-24T16:46:48.290", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OH70F.jpg", "Id":"1785", "AccountId":"2298473", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"99", "CreationDate":"2013-02-20T13:20:27.513", "DisplayName":"Lson", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-31T16:43:20.417"}}
