{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>In my favorite dictionary of linguistic terms, \"A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics\" by R. L. Trask from 1993, <strong>middle</strong> is given four meanings, the fourth of which is a synonym of <strong>mediopassive</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>mediopassive</strong> is a transitive verb with a passive meaning but intransitve form, syntactically. Examples from the book are 1) <em>This fabric washes easily</em> and 2) <em>My new book is selling well</em>.There aren't that many such in English but in other languages it is productive, like in Basque. Verbs that can be used both transitively and intransitively are also called <strong>labile verbs</strong>.</p>\n", "Id":"1700", "ParentId":"1695", "CreationDate":"2012-03-25T11:17:33.477", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-25T11:17:33.477", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
