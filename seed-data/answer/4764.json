{"Body":"<p>The difference you've identified is between <strong>predicational</strong> and <strong>specificational</strong> copular clauses (terms coined by <a href=\"http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12988\" rel=\"nofollow\">Higgins, 1979</a>, i think). In a predicational copular sentence, the subject denotes an individual and the complement (which may be either a Noun Phrase, or an Adjectival Phrase) denotes a property. The subject is predicated of the complement. Your examples <strong>1b</strong> (i) and <strong>2a</strong> (ii) are predicational copular clauses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(i) [Saturday]<code>&lt;e&gt;</code> is [my day off]<code>&lt;e,t&gt;</code><br>\n  <em>The entity denoted by 'Saturday' satisfies the property of being the speaker's day off.</em></p>\n  \n  <p>(ii) [John]<code>&lt;e&gt;</code> is [a doctor]<code>&lt;e,t&gt;</code><br>\n  <em>The entity denoted by 'John' satisfies the property of being a doctor.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In specificational copular clauses, the relationship between subject and complement is reversed - the subject (which may only be a Noun Phrase, due presumably to the EPP), denotes a property, and the complement denotes an individual, which is predicated of the subject. Your examples <strong>1a</strong> (iii) and <strong>2b</strong> (iv) are specificational copular clauses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(iii) [My day off]<code>&lt;e,t&gt;</code> is [Saturday]<code>&lt;e&gt;</code><br>\n  <em>The entity denoted by 'Saturday' satisfies the property of being the speaker's day off.</em>  </p>\n  \n  <p>(iv) #[a doctor]<code>&lt;e,t&gt;</code> is [John]<code>&lt;e&gt;</code><br>\n  <em>The entity denoted by 'John' satisfies the property of being a doctor.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that specificational copular clauses and their predicational counter-parts are truth-conditionally equivalent. The difference is generally considered to be driven by information-structural considerations, such as topic and focus (see <a href=\"http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~mikkelsen/dissertation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Line Mikkelsen's dissertation on the topic</a>). One common assumption is that predicational and specificational copular clauses have the same underlying D-structure, as follows (using X'-notation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(a) [SpecIP ... [I' <em>[+pres]</em> [VP ... [V' is [predP John [pred' <em>pred</em>\n  [NP a doctor]]]]]]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The copular takes a small clause complement (a \"predP\", in Mikkelsen's terminology). The functional head <em>pred</em> takes a specifier of type <code>&lt;e&gt;</code> and a complement of <code>&lt;e,t&gt;</code>. In a predicational copular clause, the individual-denoting element in specPredP raises to the matrix subject position, and the complement remains in situ. In a specificational copular clause, the property-denoting element in compPredP raises to the matrix subject position, and the subject remains in-situ. See Mikkelsen's thesis for further discussion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: @Daincihi points out that i don't explain why (iv) is bad in my answer. (v), below, illustrates that there isn't any general ban on indefinite specificational subjects:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(v) [A philosopher who seems to share Kiparskysâ€™ intuitions on some\n  factive predicates] is [Unger] (1972), who argues that ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mentioned that under Mikkelsen's account, the difference between a predicational and specificational copular clause concerns information structure. One of the restrictions on a specificational copular clause is that the subject must be a <strong>topic</strong> (i.e. it must be <strong>given/old</strong> information). A bare indefinite such as \"a doctor\" can't function as a topic for fairly obvious pragmatic reasons, whereas an indefinite modified by a relative clause can, hence the difference in acceptability between (v) and (iv).</p>\n\n<p>N.b.
