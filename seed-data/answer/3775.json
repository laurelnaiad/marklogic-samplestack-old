{"Body":"<p>ATIS semantic frame annotation was done in Cambridge University under supervision of Prof. Steve Young.\nThere are two types of annotations: Abstract and word level.</p>\n\n<p>Abstract annotation is used to train <a href=\"http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~sjy/papers/heyo03a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hidden Vector State (HVS)</a> model introduced by Yulan He and is in the form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Show me flights from Boston to Washington : SS(FLIGHT(FROMLOC(CITY_NAME) TOLOC(CITY_NAME))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The annotation is parsed to a hierarchical tree explained in Yulan He's work.</p>\n\n<p>Another annotation is the word-level one which is used in other parsers like <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/tbed-parser/%E2%80%8E\" rel=\"nofollow\">TBED Parser</a> is in the form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Show me flights from Boston to Washington &lt;=&gt; flight(fromloc.city_name=Boston, toloc.city_name=Washington)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>flight is the frame name and shows the goal of the utterance and the slots (fromloc.city_name,...) shows the details of the goal.</p>\n\n<p>There is no code available to convert SQL queries to this formats but, it can be easily induced from the queries (parsing the SELECT and WHERE clauses)</p>\n", "Id":"3775", "ParentId":"3595", "LastEditorUserId":"1440", "CreationDate":"2013-05-27T11:59:27.037", "OwnerUserId":"1440", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-29T08:29:46.717", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.hushmandsazan.com", "Id":"1440", "AccountId":"191833", "CreationDate":"2012-10-24T19:06:28.160", "AboutMe":"<p>Computer Engineer ;-)</p>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"Tehran, Iran", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"183", "DisplayName":"MOLi", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-30T11:05:50.683"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-29T08:29:46.717", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.hushmandsazan.com", "Id":"1440", "AccountId":"191833", "CreationDate":"2012-10-24T19:06:28.160", "AboutMe":"<p>Computer Engineer ;-)</p>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"Tehran, Iran", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"183", "DisplayName":"MOLi", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-30T11:05:50.683"}}
