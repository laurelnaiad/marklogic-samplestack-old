{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I believe you have to idiomatically translate Romance articles preceding proper names into English demonstratives.   Hence, <em>¿Dónde está la María?</em> becomes something more like <em>Now where <strong>is</strong> that Maria, anyway?</em>, or some such loose translation with additional fluff to indicate the colloquial register.  </p>\n\n<p>Notice how it now doesn’t seem odd to use a demonstrative instead of an article: that is, saying <strong><em>that</strong> Maria</em> instead of  <strong><em>the</strong> Maria</em>.\nThis may relate to the distant origin of <em>la María</em> in <em>illa Maria</em> from Latin, back from before demonstratives became articles.  Latin certainly could use demonstatrive adjectives with proper names.  For example, you could say <em>ille Caesar</em>, like <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=wmnZvwo0N-IC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=%22ille+caesar%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c0KFWCPoKD&amp;sig=DYUnT4JUd-lqsuisZUZd3Qa31GY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I5AeUPSwHOKbyQHj2IG4CQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ille%20caesar%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=2NZpR3EmptkC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=ille+caesar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=laVFtVQp8p&amp;sig=E6Dx476BjEHEHfCVAA4q3zlI_Xc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yo4eUPHzCsK_yQGWyIDICQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ille%20caesar&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  When the demonstratives turned into articles, one didn’t stop doing this.</p>\n\n\n", "Id":"2356", "ParentId":"5", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T15:32:17.620", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"707", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-05T15:32:17.620", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"26", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.perl.com/", "Id":"707", "AccountId":"216196", "CreationDate":"2012-01-24T16:28:35.700", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/216196\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/216196.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for tchrist on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for tchrist on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly.
