If \"a/an\" and \"the\" go in the same position relative to a noun, then having a term that covers the words that go in that position is worthwhile, ditto for having terms for the position itself, and how other words place themselves relative to the noun and the whatchamacallit. </p>\n\n<pre><code>a red car\nthe red car\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Very simplified here: Can you use more than one of a and the in front of a noun? Nope. Can you move the adjective (red) to the left of the whatchamacallit? No. If you want to add more adjectives, where do you put them? Between the whatchamacallit and the noun. Are there other words that can go in the whatchamacallit-position in English? Well, then that is also the same type of whatchamacallit. In English it just so happens that whatchamacallits that pattern in this particular way are traditionally called articles.</p>\n\n<p>Part of speech/word class is only defined <em>for a specific</em> language. Other languages have other parts-of-speech/word classes that pattern differently. There are similarities, but: if you want to give a pattern in language A the same name as a possibly similar pattern in language B, you need to back it up, be it with examples, analysis or cites/references. The same rough \"meaning\" is not enough.</p>\n", "Id":"1414", "ParentId":"1411", "CreationDate":"2012-02-13T20:29:41.070", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-13T20:29:41.070", "CommentCount":"6"}
