{"Body":"<p>I have a PhD in computational linguistics. I can tell you that NLP and CL are not two separate fields. Rather, CL is the superset that encompasses NLP.</p>\n\n<p>In everyday CL practice, NLP focuses on the building of NL parsers and as such it is central to the CL field. CL as a field includes a lot more than NLP. For instance, you can study machine translation, knowledge representation, ontology engineering, text mining, information extraction, etc. all within the CL field.  CL is a pretty broad thing and (unlike CS) is not primarily focused on theory. It is highly hands-on. Most theories in CL come from theoretical CS. When it comes to the nitty-gritty CL is the practical application of various algorithms for purposes of natural language processing. </p>\n\n<p>You may occasionally encounter a reference to NLP (sans CL) within the field of CS. This is due to the fact that -originally- the generation of parsers served purposes beyond the confines of natural language (the way we mean \"natural language\" within CL). So, one could argue that NLP within CS is a slightly different animal than NLP within CL. In essence, it's the same kind of object seen under slightly different light.   </p>\n", "Id":"1832", "ParentId":"1802", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2012-04-20T14:40:23.163", "OwnerUserId":"946", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-24T18:19:34.203", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
