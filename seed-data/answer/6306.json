Lakoff and Johnson showed that language is metaphorical, and thus not literal, so it can't represent anything.  Darwin showed that dog and human brains are fundamentally the same;  dogs don't use symbolic language, so humans don't either.  If they did, there would need to be brain faculties for representation and computation, of which there are neither.\n     Since words arise to enable actions in the culture, they are muscular actions of the vocal system, and don't symbolize any entity.\n     So in conclusion, no human language is symbolic.  Unfortunately, the illusion of language makes it appear that they are entities performing actions on other non-extant entities.  This verbal logic is always used to justify war.\n     So hopefully, brain research will show that thinking is muscular, and based on cultural peer-pressure (superstition), before the next war justified by illusion.</p>\n", "Id":"6306", "ParentId":"3023", "CreationDate":"2014-01-04T04:10:23.247", "Score":"-3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2970", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-04T04:10:23.247", "CommentCount":"3"}
