{"Body":"<p>The Bar-Hillel article deals mostly with the ability to disambiguate words in isolation and with the aid of context.  While an ambiguous word in isolation is difficult or impossible even for humans (e.g. which word am I referring to when I say \"pool\"?), a machine could at least make an attempt to choose the word-sense with the highest probability of occurring.  Even this though needs to be trained on a wide range of domains in order to get the most accurate statistical range for the word in question. </p>\n\n<p>As far as determining a word-sense from context, I would say that the article is severely outdated, as there are many algorithms that can achieve very accurate results.  One of the methods involves looking at sources like <a href=\"http://wordnet.princeton.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordNet</a> to determine the likelihood of a word sense based on the maximum likelihood estimate of the other non-function words in the context range.  </p>\n\n<p>There are many articles describing these methods and more available online.  Perhaps some of these sources will be useful: <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?gcx=c&amp;q=machine%20disambiguation&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ws\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Scholar - \"Machine Disambiguation\"</a></p>\n", "Id":"585", "ParentId":"582", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T15:20:11.647", "OwnerUserId":"150", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-28T18:30:25.403", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-28T18:30:25.403", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"150", "AccountId":"409031", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"535", "CreationDate":"2011-09-17T17:33:21.593", "DisplayName":"Mark Tuttle", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-29T16:52:17.370"}}
