{"Body":"<ol>\n<li>some linguists see a distinction between A) 'descriptive' (selecting one of many possible features) and B) 'classificatory' (specifying a subset of the class) modifiers, and would say that 'beautiful' and 'big' are descriptive (eg Halliday 'epithet' vs 'classifier')</li>\n<li>your suggestion of hyperonomy/superordination would place 'beautiful, big' in B), i.e meaning that 'beautiful girls' are a subset of 'girls' and that 'big cities' are a subset of 'cities'</li>\n<li>there is also an implicit notion that 'descriptive' = 'subjective/personal opinion', and 'classificatory' = 'objective/consensus opinion'; so many linguists would disagree with your suggestion that 'beautiful, big' are 'objective/consensus' classes</li>\n<li>from my corpus linguistics perspective, 'beautiful girl and 'big city' are frequent collocations (strictly speaking, i should check the statistics in a large general English corpus before asserting this, so... <a href=\"http://corpus2.byu.edu/glowbe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://corpus2.byu.edu/glowbe/</a>, a corpus of 1.9 billion words, tells me that the most frequent modifiers occurring one word before 'girl' in 226047 authentic text examples are: little, young, old, baby, teenage, beautiful; so beautiful is the 6th most frequent collocate)... so i would suggest that 'beautiful girl' is a usage-based/consensus unit of language, which draws on both the descriptive and classificatory functions/purposes of language? </li>\n<li>'beautiful girl and big city' cannot be analysed further without knowing more details about the contextual occurrence of this collocation - eg in which specific text and genre of text, written/spoken by whom, in what historical/social circumstance, etc?</li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"4809", "ParentId":"4804", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2013-10-29T11:11:48.400", "OwnerUserId":"2646", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-29T14:31:31.153", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-29T14:31:31.153", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2646", "AccountId":"3506361", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"11", "CreationDate":"2013-10-29T11:11:48.400", "DisplayName":"ramesh", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-29T12:47:12.823"}}
