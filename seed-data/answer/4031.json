Every part of speech is a syntactic category, but many syntactic categories are not parts of speech. This holds particularly of the distinction between word and phrase. Words are parts of speech, but phrases are not. A noun is a part of speech and a syntactic category, whereas a noun phrase is a syntactic category but not a part of speech. An adjective is a part of speech and a syntactic category, whereas an adjective phrase is a syntactic category but not a part of speech. Thus the term <em>part of speech</em> denotes a subgroup inside the greater group denoted by <em>syntactic category</em>. </p>\n", "Id":"4031", "ParentId":"4026", "CreationDate":"2013-07-19T17:06:35.077", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-19T17:06:35.077", "CommentCount":"1"}
