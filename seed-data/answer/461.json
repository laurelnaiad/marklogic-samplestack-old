{"Body":"<p>Although other romance languages haven't lost verb conjugations, they <em>have</em> lost noun declensions by essentially the same process. People frequently don't pronounce the ends of words in rushed or casual speech, and this can eventually become the norm. English lost its declensions and conjugations in roughly the same way.</p>\n\n<p>French (like English) compensates for the lack of conjugations by generally requiring pronouns which can be left out in other romance languages and in Latin. Colloquial French actually goes further than English, requiring pronouns even when there is already a noun, as in \"La France, c'est belle!\" This may well be the root of a new conjugation system someday...</p>\n\n<p>I know this wasn't the main point of your question, but it's worth remembering that in general written language tends to lag behind spoken language. The mess that is English spelling came about largely because the spoken language changed significantly without any reforms to the writing system. French has fared slightly better but is still riddled with no-longer-pronounced letters or even syllables.</p>\n", "Id":"461", "ParentId":"459", "LastEditorUserId":"58", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T17:40:08.397", "OwnerUserId":"58", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-18T17:04:47.170", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"43", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"58", "AccountId":"264197", "Views":"14", "Reputation":"458", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:34:17.763", "DisplayName":"Anschel Schaffer-Cohen", "LastAccessDate":"2011-11-03T19:12:24.783"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-18T17:04:47.170", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"43", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"58", "AccountId":"264197", "Views":"14", "Reputation":"458", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:34:17.763", "DisplayName":"Anschel Schaffer-Cohen", "LastAccessDate":"2011-11-03T19:12:24.783"}}
