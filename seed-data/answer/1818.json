{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Regarding Romanian's history: it's a member of the Eastern Romance (<em>sensu strictu</em>) subfamily or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Romance_languages\">\"Vlach\" languages</a>. The peculiarities of Romanian are shared by its sisters in that branch such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanian_language\">Aromanian</a> in Greece, Macedonia, Albania; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megleno-Romanian_language\">Megleno-romanian</a> in Greece, Macedonia, and Turkey; and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istro-Romanian_language\">Istrian</a> in, well, Istria. Their peculiar history was influenced by at least 4 distinct factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Being the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Romania#Dacia\">earliest area to split off from the Empire</a>, in 271 AD - leading to loss of stabilizing linguistic influence from Rome</li>\n<li>Geographical and later social separation from the other Romance languages, leading to less influence by and fewer borrowings from Germanic. E.g. 'white', instead of coming from Germanic <strong>blank</strong>, is <strong>alb</strong> from Latin <strong>albus</strong></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund\">Balkan Sprachbund</a> shared with Slavic, Greek, and Albanian. The Sprachbund had a significant influence on both grammar and, to a lesser extent, lexicon.</li>\n<li>The influence of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Romance_substratum\">Paleo-balkan substratum</a> which is not inconsiderable - some scholars report <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Romanian_words_of_possible_Dacian_origin\">up to 500 roots may be inherited from Dacian</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, every modern Romance language has its own peculiar history, but the above I think covers the bases about what makes the Dacian language different.</p>\n", "Id":"1818", "ParentId":"375", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T01:38:06.027", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"537", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-19T01:38:06.027", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
