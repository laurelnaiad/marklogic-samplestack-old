I don't always view it as a bad thing. We all should accept that times move on, and nobody misses Akkadian nowadays or wishes that Avestan was still being spoken on the streets so we could go around asking for 'satem' of everything (:D), but times do have to move on and if we move onto a world in 50 years with only 1,000 (500?) languages, that's the way it will have to be and we all have to adjust to that. However, it's still not the case that we're losing something special every time those last speakers perish.</p>\n", "Id":"1586", "ParentId":"1549", "CreationDate":"2012-03-07T00:47:04.887", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"720", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-07T00:47:04.887", "CommentCount":"1"}
