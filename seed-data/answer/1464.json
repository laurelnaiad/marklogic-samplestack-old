{"OwnerDisplayName":"user325", "Body":"<p>Your question is a bit confused because it conflates ungrammaticality with things like garden paths and center embeddings. Both of these (garden paths and center embeddings) are indeed grammatical but are often at first perceived to be ungrammatical because of processing difficulty. In this way, the linguist is in fact more equipped to determine the relevant sentences' grammaticality than your average Joe.</p>\n\n<p>It's also the case that there is a normal amount of variation in intuition, sometimes because of dialect and sometimes just differing acquisition. In other words even two people who grow up in relatively similar circumstances are probably walking around with slightly different grammars of English. (Clearly, in yours, multiple that is fine: in mine, it's not.) Some grammaticality judgments are more rigid than others, of course; everybody would say that a determiner following its noun in English is ungrammatical, but certain ECP violations will sound better or worse depending on the exact sentence and the listener. (And in fact adding words like \"yesterday\" to a triple embedding does help its parse-ability.) It does not necessarily mean that you are out of touch if people differ in their grammaticality judgments, although you might be an outlier. That is why it's important to check with other real people, even as haphazard as that can be. (Lack of evidence for a construction, for example on the Internet or in a corpus, does not necessarily mean it is ungrammatical, as is the case for triple center embeddings.) Rarely will an argument ride entirely on one judgment, though.</p>\n", "Id":"1464", "ParentId":"1439", "CreationDate":"2012-02-18T18:46:10.467", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-18T18:46:10.467", "comments":[]}
