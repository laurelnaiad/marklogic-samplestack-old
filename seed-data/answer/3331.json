{"Body":"<p>The thing is that two musical systems are different, the Occidental being septatonic and the Oriental, pentatonic. Thus, 'western' music distiguishes seven tones, while 'eastern' music distiguishes five tones.</p>\n\n<p>However, in both musical metanarrations the 4:3 and 3:2 ratios are used for the melos and canon settings. And, yes, there was a time when septatonic scale was also applied in Chinese music.</p>\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://baruchim.narod.ru/Roll1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">a link to Chinese poetry transcribed in western alphabet and read by native speakers along with the Chinese music played</a>  (sorry, the translations are in Russian only). One can notice that there is a certain match between the tones in Chinese speech and those in the music.</p>\n", "Id":"3331", "ParentId":"3309", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T08:39:50.153", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-08T08:50:07.753", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
