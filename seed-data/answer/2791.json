{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>One possible approach would be the following:</p>\n\n<p>Semantic relatedness can be derived from <a href=\"http://www.sics.se/~mange/TheWordSpaceModel.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">word-space models</a>. With a word-space model you could also identify the different contexts in which an ambiguous word is used (e.g. through clustering different contexts based on their vectors). If you do this, let's say, for the word <em>bass</em>, you should end up with two clusters - one with bass occurring in fish-related contexts, one with music-related contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have done this, you might be able to disambiguate new words through comparing their context vectors, and see which cluster provides the best match.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this is just a suggestion. Whether or not it would work very well is a different matter. :)</p>\n\n<p>(A link to the paper you mentioned would be appreciated, by the way!)</p>\n", "Id":"2791", "ParentId":"2776", "CreationDate":"2012-11-03T23:21:57.960", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1452", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-03T23:21:57.960", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Groningen, Netherlands", "Id":"1452", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1943733", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"188", "CreationDate":"2012-10-30T17:13:14.697", "DisplayName":"Bjerva", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-17T14:05:45.320", "AboutMe":"<p>Ph.D. student in Computational Semantics at the University of Groningen</p>\n"}}
