{"comments":[], "Body":"<p><em>Both...And, Either...Or,</em> and <em>Neither...Nor</em> are the classic examples of correlative conjunctions.<br>\n<em>Either</em> is a disjunctive dual form in English, parallel with <em>both</em>, a conjunctive dual form, in some uses: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>He wants to talk to both Bill and Mike</em> ~ <em>He wants to talk to Bill and Mike.</em></li>\n<li><em>He wants to talk to either Bill or Mike ~ He wants to talk to Bill or Mike.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Outside of dual reference, however, <em>both</em> and <em>either</em> don't work as correlatives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>*<em>He wants to talk to both Bill, Mike, and Joe.</em> ~ <em>He wants to talk to Bill, Mike, and Joe.</em></li>\n<li>*<em>He wants to talk to either Bill, Mike, or Joe.</em> ~ <em>He wants to talk to Bill, Mike, or Joe.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Both</em> and <em>either</em> can be used pronominally</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>He wants to talk to both (of them).</em></li>\n<li><em>He wants to talk to either (one) (of them).</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Though only <em>both</em> (as the suppletive dual of the quantifier <em>all</em>) can undergo Q-Float:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>He wants to talk to both/all (of them).</em> ~ <em>He wants to talk to them both/all.</em></li>\n<li><em>Both/All (of them) want to talk to him.</em> ~ <em>They both/all want to talk to him.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, I think it's most useful to consider <em>either</em> as an auxiliary conjunction; it does some of the work of a conjunction, and appears in an optional supporting role with other conjunctions in special circumstances. That's pretty much what <strong>all</strong> auxiliaries do in English -- <em>be, get, have, can</em>; articles, particles, and prepositions. Why not conjunctions?</p>\n", "Id":"4218", "ParentId":"4216", "CreationDate":"2013-08-18T18:20:11.763", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-18T18:20:11.763", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
