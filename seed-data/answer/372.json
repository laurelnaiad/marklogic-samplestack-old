{"Body":"<p>In order to study documents written in some unknown language, or to study the language itself, there's the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_method_%28linguistics%29\">Combinatorial method</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It  is used to study texts which are written in an unknown language, and to study the language itself, where the unknown language has no obvious or proven well-understood close relatives, and there are few bilingual texts which might otherwise have been used to help understand the language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure it's what you needed since this is mainly about texts, rather than analyzing a spoken language.</p>\n\n<p>But, speaking about the linguist having to master an unknown language, I'd like to introduce Quine, who was not a linguist but a philosopher and a logician. </p>\n\n<p>About translation, \"<i>Quine tried to show that \"radical translation\" from one language to another is logically impossible. Suppose, he said, that you are standing by a native in a foreign land who speaks only a language you do not understand. A rabbit runs by and the native says \"<em>gavagai</em>\". Quine claims that you have no way of knowing whether 'gavagai' means \"<em>rabbit</em>\", or \"<em>there goes a rabbit</em>\", or \"<em>isn't it a lovely day!</em>\". Of course, linguists and even ordinary people have sometimes gone into foreign areas knowing not a single word of the local language, and have mastered it quite well. [...] The simple answer to Quine's puzzle is that if you have not yet got enough experience with the new language to be sure of its proper translation, then get some more experience with it. As long as beings share a common universe, and to the extent they share a common existence, proper translation will always be possible.</i>\"</p>\n\n<p>This belongs to the theory called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation\">Indeterminacy of translation</a>\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: There are other methods illustrated in this slideshow, provided by the Professor Peter Austin, called \"<a href=\"http://bit.ly/r8kGOe\">Linguistic Fieldwork: An introduction</a>\".
