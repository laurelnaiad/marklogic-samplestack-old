{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Thanks to Robert for pointing me at this. Here is an approach to approximate the number of word types in a corpus. We assume that Zipf's law holds and the frequency of the second most common word type is 1/2 the frequency of the most common word type and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Let N be the corpus size. Let maxfreq be the (relative) frequency of the most common word type. Then by Zipf's law, it should be</p>\n\n<p>freq(w) = maxfreq / rank(w)</p>\n\n<p>where rank tells us at what rank(w) the word type is with respect to its frequency, and freq(w) is the relative frequency of that word type.</p>\n\n<p>The number of word types can be approximated by the maximal rank of words that have an absolute frequency higher than 1.</p>\n\n<p>max rank(w)<br/>\ns.t.  N*freq(w) >= 1</p>\n\n<p>that means that this maximum is N*maxfreq</p>\n\n<p>So, if the most common word had a relative frequency of 20%, then the number of word types would also be roughly 20% of the corpus size. I think this will overestimate pretty much always.</p>\n", "Id":"4442", "ParentId":"4431", "CreationDate":"2013-09-13T09:36:07.053", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2463", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-13T09:36:07.053", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2463", "AccountId":"1387645", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"116", "CreationDate":"2013-09-12T11:54:42.957", "DisplayName":"kutschkem", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-13T09:24:10.320"}}
