They're more like some English ones, just strings of nouns. The only difference is that in writing they don't use spaces or hyphens. \nI think the reason why long compound formations are found so often in agglutinative languages is probably just because of the usefulness of derivational morphemes- they allow a language to have a smaller core vocabulary, which makes it easier to learn. </p>\n", "Id":"3435", "ParentId":"2064", "CreationDate":"2013-03-27T03:58:19.557", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1901", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-27T03:58:19.557", "CommentCount":"1"}
