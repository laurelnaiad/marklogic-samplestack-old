{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It is impossible to really know for sure how a feminine marker \"originated\" in Indo-European, since the exact nature of gender there is unknown, since Hittite conveys only two genders (or states): animate and inanimate. Furthermore, \"animalia\" is a neuter plural. Nevertheless, it suffices to say that the Semitic ending in Arabic ة-/ية (-ah/iyah) is not at all related to the Indo-European one. Take for example a Berber word for \"house\": \"tamdint\"; the t-t indicates a feminine. The root is \"mdn\" like \"مدينة\" (medīnah, city) in Arabic, which becomes \"مدينات\" (medīnāt, cities) in the plural. Therefore the Eurasiatic theory is far-fetched. \nI might not have fully answered your question, but at least this hopefully narrows it. I think it is important to ponder this sort of thing, but the answer will likely never be known.</p>\n", "Id":"2675", "ParentId":"1258", "CreationDate":"2012-10-11T04:48:14.977", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1394", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-11T04:48:14.977", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1394", "AccountId":"1926489", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"82", "CreationDate":"2012-10-11T03:30:07.557", "DisplayName":"Maxwell Garrison", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-23T00:43:35.460"}}
