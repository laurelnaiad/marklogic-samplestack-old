{"Body":"<p>The answers so far agree that <em>a/an</em> must be a preposition because it can be replaced by other prepositions. I think this is a possible but not ideal analysis. It is not ideal because it means positing a new preposition <em>a/an</em> which only occurs in phrases of the type <em>[x amount of currency] a/an [(time) unit]</em>, where 'unit' is a measure of something that can be bought - hours of working time or things, for example (thanks to dainichi for pointing out <code>Ten bucks a piece</code>). The description of a grammar and vocabulary of a language should be <strong>parsimonious</strong>, which is to say it should have as few entries in the lexicon/vocabulary and syntactic rules as possible as long as this results in an equally accurate analysis.</p>\n\n<p>I think the phrase <em>[x amount of currency] a/an [(time) unit]</em> might have arisen due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis\" rel=\"nofollow\">ellipsis</a> from <em>[x amount of currency] for a/an [(time) unit]</em>. This explanation avoids positing a new entry of <em>a/an</em> as preposition.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that such expressions are common in other languages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>German: zehn Euro die Stunde (&lt; zehn Euro für die Stunde)</li>\n<li>Gloss:       ten euro the hour</li>\n<li>German: zehn Euro das Stück</li>\n<li>Gloss: ten euro the piece</li>\n<li>French: dix euro l'heure</li>\n<li>Gloss:       ten euro the-hour</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Not 100 % sure about the French example since I'm not a native speaker, but I think it's grammatical).</p>\n\n<p>The only difference is that German and French use a definite article, whereas English has the indefinite article. In neither of these languages, I think, do articles/determiners double as prepositions.</p>\n", "Id":"4055", "ParentId":"4049", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "CreationDate":"2013-07-24T20:07:40.340", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-25T16:28:37.803", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-25T16:28:37.803", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
