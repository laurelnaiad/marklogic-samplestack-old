Page xxii is a summary of the principles the IPA (association) uses to select the symbols for the IPA (alphabet) and if you wonder about a specific symbol you can look it up in the same book. Most of the symbols have their own separate histories, for instance one of the principles is that letters taken from the latin alphabet is to stand for the most common (as in number of languages, not number of speakers) sound for that letter. However the {r} is used for the alveolar trill, which isn't really that common.</p>\n", "Id":"231", "ParentId":"213", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T18:19:21.613", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-16T18:19:21.613", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
