{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>If you are interested in the philosophical side of this question, there are relevant texts by Leibniz, who mastered several languages. He had a take on the way one thinks with or without symbols:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is only too true that even in their minds men put words in place of\n  ideas, especially when the ideas are complex and indeterminate. But it\n  is true also, as you have observed, that in such a case the mind\n  contents itself with merely taking note of the truth without yet\n  understanding it, being convinced that it can understand it whenever\n  it wants to.</p>\n  \n  <p>G. W. Leibniz, <em>New Essays on Human Understanding</em>, Book IV, Chap. 5, § 4 (text available here for instance: <a href=\"http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfbits/ne41.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfbits/ne41.pdf</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The following publication (in German) provides a good overview of the subject:  S.
