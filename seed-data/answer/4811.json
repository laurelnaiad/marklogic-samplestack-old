Their definition is very general: adverbs are distinguished from adjectives, which modify nouns, by saying that ‘adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs’; to this one can add that they may also modify phrases and clauses as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>If something doesn’t fit nicely in some other word class, it generally gets lumped in as an adverb of some sort. Traditionally, adverbs (and adverbials, which means ‘any chunk that acts like an adverb’ -– not a terribly precise definition) represent qualifications and afterthoughts to ordinary propositions. </p>\n\n<p>And they can occur in many different positions in the sentence, which means they may or may not be close to whatever constituents they focus on. Which allows lots of useful variations and conventions.</p>\n\n<p>\"Sentence adverb\" is not a type of adverb.<br>\nIt's a type of adverbial <strong>construction</strong>, or usage;<br>\none of the things some adverbs can do.<br>\nThat's all. </p>\n\n<p>And \"sentence adverb\" is a sloppy technical term, since it doesn't distinguish \"sentence adverbs\"<br>\nfrom \"clause adverbs\", or \"phrase adverbs\", which also exist, but are not mentioned.<br>\nSo I wouldn't worry too much about \"sentence adverbs\".</p>\n", "Id":"4811", "ParentId":"4805", "CreationDate":"2013-10-29T16:56:55.660", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-29T16:56:55.660", "CommentCount":"8"}
