If the 'uo' in 'uomo' is treated like a single vowel, then it's a diphthong; but if the 'u' is treated like a consonant, then it's a glide.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, a diphthong is when a vowel-vowel sequence is treated like one vowel; and a glide is when one vowel in a vowel-vowel sequence is treated instead as a consonant. (Really, it's not that glides have lower sonority than vowels, it's that vowels have their relative sonority level reduced when they're used as glides.)</p>\n", "Id":"3842", "ParentId":"3839", "CreationDate":"2013-06-09T18:07:59.667", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-09T18:07:59.667", "CommentCount":"3"}
