{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There are a fairly large number of works on theoretical syntax applied to North American indigenous languages, for example on Stʼatʼimcets (Lillooet), Halkomelem, Plains Cree, Blackfoot, Navajo, and Slave, where the linguists have worked firmly within the Government &amp; Binding → Minimalism framework. The work on the syntax of Salishan languages gives serious problems for syntax in terms of part-of-speech categories (noun vs. verb vs. adjective), and also in word order (they are mostly VSO); see work by Lisa Matthewson, Henry Davis, Martina Wiltschko, and others. Athabaskan, Algonquian, and Eskimo-Aleut languages challenge the idea that sentences need to have subjects and objects, since all of these families frequently show sentences consisting solely of verbs and perhaps adverbs; see work by e.g. Rose-Marie Déchaine, Meredith Johnson, Clare Cook, and Jeff Meuhlbauer. The Athabaskan (and Na-Dene) languages strongly challenge the concepts of morphology, since in these languages the verbs are constructed in a non-concatenative way that looks much more like syntax than it does conventional morphology; see work by Keren Rice, Leslie Saxon, Eloise Jelinek, and Ken Hale, among several others.</p>\n", "Id":"1030", "ParentId":"538", "CreationDate":"2011-11-16T02:23:41.830", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"511", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-16T02:23:41.830", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"30", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.drangle.com/~james", "Id":"511", "AccountId":"513739", "CreationDate":"2011-11-16T02:03:12.387", "AboutMe":"<p>I’m a PhD student in linguistics at the University of British Columbia. I work on Tlingit, a critically endangered language of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and southeast Alaska. I also have extensive interests in the related Athabaskan languages, language documentation theory and practice, orthography design, morphological theory, phonological theory, and the syntax of noun phrases and relativization.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using TeX and friends for more than a decade. I use Xe(La)TeX, fontspec, memoir, and BibLaTeX extensively, and I am working on a BibLaTeX style for linguistics publications. Other packages I use frequently include pst-jtree, expex, and booktabs. I’m learning PGF/TikZ and considering developing a library to produce autosegmental representation diagrams. I do my writing in TeXShop, and my TeX programming in MacVim, having abandoned FSF Emacs and XEmacs due to their perpetually disappointing Unicode rendering.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"5", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"866", "DisplayName":"James C.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-03T19:13:48.097"}}
