{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I would agree with your second hypothesis. Since <code>P_1*V_1 = P_2*V_2</code> for an ideal gas, and an obstruction farther along the vocal tract creates a larger volume than another, there will be a corresponding pressure decrease.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting related phenomenon is that voiced alveolar stops tend to be more retroflex than their voiceless counterparts (which have longer VOT). Ohala (1983) explains that, counterintuitively, retroflex stops have a larger oral cavity behind the constriction; thus, the gas law above predicts that they will have a shorter VOT.</p>\n\n<p>Ohala, J.J.
