{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>According to the Wiktionary for the Old Norse name <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%8Dvarr#Old_Norse\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ívarr</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first part (<em>Ív-</em>) stems from Proto-Germanic *<em>īwaz</em> (“yew”), whence also Old English <em>īw</em>. The second part (<em>-arr</em>) stems from Proto-Germanic *<em>harjaz</em> (“warrior”), whence also Old Norse <em>herr</em> (“army, crowd”). Partly merged with Old Norse <em>Yngvarr</em>, <em>Ingvarr</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>About <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Álvaro</em></a>, the same source presents the following etymology:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Álvaro</em> and <em>Álvara</em> stem from the Late Latin proper name <em>Alvarus</em>, from Spanish-Visigothic. The Germanic proper name consists of two parts: The first part stems from *<em>all-</em> (\"all\") or from *<em>adal-</em> (\"noble\"). The second part stems from *<em>-wars</em> (\"protection, defense\"). However, there exist other etymologies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the name Álvaro can also be found in <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Portuguese</a>, one of these \"other etymologies\" is that <em>Alvaro</em> would have stemmed from <em>Ælfred</em>, related to Germanic <em>alfi</em>, \"elf\", <em>radi</em>, \"counsel\". The voicing (from [f] to [v]) could have been influenced by the Hispanic <em>albar</em>, derived from Latin <em>albor</em> (from <em>albus</em>, \"white\").</p>\n\n<p>There is another, more far-fetched etymology: according to Meyer-Lübke, <em><a href=\"http://books.google.com.br/books/about/Romanische_Namenstudien.html?hl=pt-BR&amp;id=6yETAAAAQAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Romanische Namenstudien</a></em>. I, 8, 81, II, 73, the name <em>Álvaro</em> stems from <em>al-</em>, \"all\", and *<em>wars</em>, \"aware, circumspect\"; another possibility for the second element is a derived form of the Gothic <em>warjan</em>. So, it would mean something like \"he who is aware of everyone/everything\" or \"he who defends himself from everyone/everything\".</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the etymological evidence is quite weak and there is no consensus on the matter. </p>\n", "Id":"1162", "ParentId":"1159", "CreationDate":"2011-12-15T17:10:48.773", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-15T17:10:48.773", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
