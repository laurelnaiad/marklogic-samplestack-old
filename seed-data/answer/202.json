Superstrate languages are the languages of the colonisers (so usually French/English/German) and the substrate languages are the local indigenous or imported labourers. In the traditional view of creolisation it's usually the superstrate language that provides the lexicon and the substrate languages that brings many grammatical structures. See the wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language): \"Most often, the vocabulary comes from the dominant group and the grammar from the subordinate group, where such stratification exists.\" </p>\n\n<p>I know it's not exactly the same situation that you're referring to, but it gives an indication that substrate languages can influence language in more than just the lexicon.</p>\n", "Id":"202", "ParentId":"190", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T01:00:19.847", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"64", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-16T01:00:19.847", "CommentCount":"3"}
