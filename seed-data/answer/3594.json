{"Body":"<p>I don't know another language which has singulatives like Welsh. </p>\n\n<p>But it's well to remember that Welsh, like English and the Western Romance languages, has lost all its case inflection except on pronouns. The reason I bring this up is that in Russian and other Slavonic languages many nouns have a suffix <em>except</em> in the genitive plural (eg рука (ruka) 'hand'; рук (ruk) 'hand <em>gen. pl</em>')</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm pretty sure that Welsh singulatives aren't like this, and they do actually contain a singulative suffix (IIRC <em>plant</em> 'children' is borrowed from Latin <em>planta</em>, so the singular <em>plentyn</em> must be derived). But you can't tell that from their current form.</p>\n", "Id":"3594", "ParentId":"3587", "LastEditorUserId":"718", "CreationDate":"2013-04-21T00:25:28.413", "OwnerUserId":"718", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-23T23:27:06.793", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"90", "Location":"England, United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"718", "AccountId":"34526", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"1364", "CreationDate":"2012-01-27T00:02:42.473", "DisplayName":"Colin Fine", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:15:12.837"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-23T23:27:06.793", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"90", "Location":"England, United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"718", "AccountId":"34526", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"1364", "CreationDate":"2012-01-27T00:02:42.473", "DisplayName":"Colin Fine", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:15:12.837"}}
