Almost always in \"root-and-pattern\" systems, you'll find roots that have their own inherent vowels and CV-patterns (or syllable structures), but the templates often ride roughshod over those vowels and CV-patterns, and sometimes the consonants too.</p>\n\n<p>The most notable/studied native American language of this type is Yowlumni (usually called Yawelmani until recently). You'll find some similar features in Muskogean languages, and probably several others.</p>\n\n<p>You'll also find templatic morphology at the next level up from Semitic, in other Afro-Asiatic languages like Berber and Hausa.</p>\n", "Id":"4656", "ParentId":"4630", "CreationDate":"2013-10-08T14:48:30.353", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2358", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-08T14:48:30.353", "CommentCount":"1"}
