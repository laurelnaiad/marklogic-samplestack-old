{"Body":"<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Historical linguistics is my hobby, it’s not my area of professional expertise. So here are my thoughts.</em></p>\n\n<p>Morphologically, we have CeRC here (R stands for the resonant). </p>\n\n<p>It’s an athematic noun, which means that endings were added directly to the stem (sunu-) without an intervening thematic vowel. Obviously, it is also an u-stem.</p>\n\n<p>All athematic nouns have strong (e.g. nom. and acc. sg., nom.pl.) and weak cases (the rest).</p>\n\n<p>If you subscribe to accent and ablaut paradigms, this particular noun is proterokinetic (or proterodynamic), which means that in strong cases the accent was on the full-grade root (the e-grade), whereas in weak cases both the accent and full grade shifted onto the suffix, so the u-suffix becomes –eu- (or –ou-, the o-grade) in  weak cases. So, at this stage, we reconstruct  NOM.SG. as *seunus - the standard citation form is the e-grade.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the (PIE) daughter languages the root didn’t ablaut already, cf. Sanskrit sunus, Lith. sunus etc. (sorry, no diacritics).</p>\n\n<p>Now about the root vowel. Usually the long u is not reconstructed as a vowel phoneme in the PIE. Since in Sanskrit and Lithuanian we have a long root vowel – and “y” in Slavic, we need something to make our short u long. If you subscribe to the laryngeal theory, obviously you propose  a laryngeal H (capital H means unspecified); some researchers propose h3 here. So, now, at this stage, we reconstruct NOM.SG. as *seuHnus (or *seuh3nus). For weak cases, we could reconstruct the zero-grade stem *suHn-eu or rather *suHn-ou (other variants: *suh3neu, *suh3nou). Here's a partial paradigm for this noun (singular):</p>\n\n<p>IE <strong>*séu̯h3-nu-s</strong> ‘son’</p>\n\n<p>NOM. *séu̯h3-nu-s</p>\n\n<p>ACC. *séu̯h3-nu-m</p>\n\n<p>DAT. *su̯h3-nóu̯</p>\n\n<p>GEN. *su̯h3-nóu̯-s</p>\n\n<p>(Herzenberg 2010: 69)</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t subscribe to the laryngeal theory, you could use a schwa instead of the laryngeal or simply reconstruct *suənu-, without any ablaut.</p>\n", "Id":"2296", "ParentId":"2286", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2012-07-24T17:28:26.037", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-25T00:10:59.490", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-25T00:10:59.490", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
