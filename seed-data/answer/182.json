In many languages including English,  /t͡ʃ/ is a separate phoneme from /t/ and /ʃ/, although the phonetic pronunciation could be identical in some dialects.  That is, most speakers would perceive the phoneme /t͡ʃ/ as sounding different from /t/ and /ʃ/, even if the waveforms are identical.</p>\n\n<p>In many circumstances, however, the waveforms may not be identical and you may be able to tell the difference between an affricate and a plosive+fricative sequence due to other phonological processes in a particular language.  For example, many American English speakers would pronounce <strong>cat shit</strong> (phonemes: /kæt.ʃɪt/) with unreleased final t's [kʰæt̚.ʃɪt̚] or even final glottal stops  [kʰæʔ.ʃɪʔ].</p>\n", "Id":"182", "ParentId":"179", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T22:57:10.947", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"95", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-15T22:57:10.947", "CommentCount":"1"}
