Strictly speaking you can add a non-syllabic marker (like the bow /̯̯̯/, or the more-open diacritic to closed vowels or the more-closed diacritic to an open vowel) to <em>any</em> vowel to produce a semi-vowel suitable for a diphthong, if how you define diphthong is a semivowel preceding or following a vowel.</p>\n\n<p>As usual for IPA, frequent/common semivowels get their own symbols, which is why we have /j w ɥ ɰ/.</p>\n\n<p>(Pet peeve: IPA isn't very good at showing diphthongs at a phonetic level, or rather, there seems to have been insuffcient interest in typological comparisons of diphthongs such that there is no agreed upon way of marking the difference between for instance English /aj/ in \"hi\" and Norwegian /ɑˑi̯/ \"hai\" or what have you.)</p>\n", "Id":"916", "ParentId":"905", "CreationDate":"2011-10-30T16:41:24.403", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-30T16:41:24.403", "CommentCount":"12"}
