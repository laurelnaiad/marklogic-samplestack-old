{"Body":"<p>Language appeared more than 50 000 years ago (and that's a conservative estimate.) The oldest writing systems appeared 6000 years ago. \nAnd in many parts of the world, writing appeared only during the XXth century. Most languages still aren't written.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, languages are dying nowadays, but are they really dying faster, or do we just get this impression because we started counting them, studying them, accounting for them ? \nWe have little elements of comparison between now, and a thousand years ago. We have no element of comparison between now and a ten thousand years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Add to that the fact that it is easy to notice when a language dies without posterity, but it takes more time to see if a new language was born, for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n<p>Historical linguistics can only get us so far back in the past, and even then, it only gives us reliable information about languages which survived and evolved. </p>\n\n<p>We will never know when there were the most languages.</p>\n", "Id":"3773", "ParentId":"3706", "LastEditorUserId":"2105", "CreationDate":"2013-05-27T00:45:26.647", "OwnerUserId":"2105", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-27T16:06:20.860", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"50", "WebsiteUrl":"http://baalhammon.fr", "Location":"France", "Id":"2105", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"2818685", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"185", "CreationDate":"2013-05-26T19:57:56.107", "DisplayName":"Typhon", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T17:08:53.360", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-27T16:06:20.860", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"50", "WebsiteUrl":"http://baalhammon.fr", "Location":"France", "Id":"2105", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"2818685", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"185", "CreationDate":"2013-05-26T19:57:56.107", "DisplayName":"Typhon", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T17:08:53.360", "AboutMe":""}}
