However, the place where they originated, which is called /Bao'an/ is in Tongren County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China. The former group are Muslims. The latter group are Tibetan Buddhists. The Muslims left because of conflict with the Buddhists. The Buddhists are classified as /Tu/ as are the Chinese-speaking residents of Wutun, which is also in Tongren County. The Wutun people, though classified as /Tu/, are devout Tibetan Buddhists and, among their number, are some of the best thanka painters in the world. </p>\n\n<p>Also in Tongren County are other Tu, who live in Gaomer and Niandehu. These Tu speak a language that is very close to what Bao'an residents speak. </p>\n\n<p>Other Tu dialects are spoken in Huzhu and Minhe.</p>\n\n<p>The contention that the Tu are descended from the Xianbei is questionable. This contention derives mostly from a sense of nationalism and the claim that /Tu/ is related to the /Tu/ in the term /Tuguhun/ /Tuyuhun/. </p>\n", "Id":"4366", "ParentId":"2573", "CreationDate":"2013-08-31T04:36:33.600", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2419", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-31T04:36:33.600", "CommentCount":"1"}
