The script could be considered a bit longer but is very exacting. It is also congruent with most sounds in UK English - spellings etc. So it makes Akha easier for a non Akha to learn, and if an Akha learns it they will not get real frustrated if they want to learn english later and find it all in conflict, spellings, sounds etc.  There are a number of books in this script on our site <a href=\"http://www.akha.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.akha.org</a> and a whole lot more that I should be transcribing but haven't due to shortage of time.</p>\n", "Id":"3907", "ParentId":"3863", "CreationDate":"2013-06-25T02:26:56.470", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2189", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-25T02:26:56.470", "CommentCount":"2"}
