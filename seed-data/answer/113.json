As a counterexample, in English, the main difference in pronunciation between regional dialects is in the vowels. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soundex</a> was originally developed to get around this issue by deleting vowels in order to find names in lists (such as telephone books and census lists). There are some parts of the US where <em>pen</em> and <em>pin</em> are pronounced the same. </p>\n\n<p>As an example in support of your hypothesis, Scandinavian languages have more vowels, and some of my relatives try to explain the difference between them to me, but I can't hear the difference. Is this training? Lack of musical ability on my part? Are they making fun of me? </p>\n", "Id":"113", "ParentId":"8", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:28:21.553", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"117", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T14:28:21.553", "CommentCount":"1"}
