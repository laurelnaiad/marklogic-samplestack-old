If what they're attaching to is a single word, you might not be able to tell the difference: in a phrase like <em>to Rome</em>, <em>to</em> looks like it could be analyzed a a prefix. But this is no longer true when a longer phrase is involved: in <em>to the beautiful city of Rome</em>, <em>to Italy's capital</em>, <em>to that place we went last summer</em>, it's clear that <em>to</em> can't be a prefix since it's attaching to a whole phrase, not just the nearest word.</p>\n\n<p>Another test that's sometimes useful is coordination: you can say <em>to and from Rome</em>, but affixes can't typically be coordinated in that way.</p>\n", "Id":"5888", "ParentId":"5886", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T22:15:54.457", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-11T22:15:54.457", "CommentCount":"2"}
