{"Body":"<p>In current mainstream generative L2 acquisition research, there are no parameters per se anymore (because there are no parameters in the MP). So, crosslinguistic variation is explained by the following factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>different languages may select different features;</li>\n<li>a feature may or may not project a functional category;</li>\n<li>the same functional category may have a set of different features;</li>\n<li>how features are realized/expressed, lexically or morphophonologically.</li>\n<li>feature strength;</li>\n<li>feature interpretability;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus, generative L2 acquisition research deals with:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ability/inability to select features;</li>\n<li>feature reassembly;</li>\n<li>accessibility of features;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For further discussion, see Lydia White (2003), <em>Second language acquisition and Universal Grammar</em>, and an excellent collection of articles, <em>The Role of Formal Features in Second Language Acquisition</em> (2010), eds. Liceras, Zobl, and Goodluck.</p>\n\n<p>As for L1 acquisition, what you mentioned in your question (Hyams' markedness, head-initial parameter etc.) was relevant in the good olde GB  days but, I'm afraid, is no longer valid in the MP. A popular view was that children set (\"switched on/off\") UG parameters on the basis of PLD (primary linguistic data). With features in the MP, there is no consensus what causes crosslinguistic variation (interfaces? lexicon? etc.). However, points 1-6 I mentioned above still hold for L1-acquiring children.</p>\n\n<p>cf. \"In the absence of a coherent minimalist theory of this type, it is not in fact possible to meaningfully evaluate the success of the P&amp;P enterprise to date.\" (Biberauer 2008, Introduction, In <em>The Limits of Syntactic Variation</em>)</p>\n", "Id":"985", "ParentId":"984", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2011-11-08T16:54:50.647", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-08T19:56:44.883", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-08T19:56:44.883", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
