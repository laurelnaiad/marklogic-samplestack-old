{"Body":"<p>I am not a linguist in any sense, but the answer appears to be that <strong>English has no unique traits</strong> (excluding trivial \"features\")*. From both a spoken and written perspective, English was formed as a mix of other languages. There is nothing that I'm aware of—<em>grammatically</em>, <em>phonetically</em>, or <em>conceptually</em>—that can be expressed solely in English.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some possibilities that stand out in English (from comments):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>English stands out as one of about a dozen languages to use <a href=\"http://wals.info/feature/40A\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"we\" as \"I\"</a> (the Royal \"we\" / <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_plural\" rel=\"nofollow\">Majestic plural</a>), though it's not unique. – Zairja</li>\n  <li><strong>Not unique as per comment:</strong> I remember that in one of his books (probably « la structure des langues »), Hagège mentioned that constructions à la “Do you know what I'm thinking about?“ with this separation between the preposition and the conjunction were very original. I will try to find what he says exactly and post it as an answer. – JPP</li>\n  <li>\"Did\" at the beginning of this sentence has no meaning. That's a feature caused English being filtered through Celtic language speakers. Their feature came out as a \"do\" as in \"Do you have a car?\" which would be rendered as \"Vous avez une voiture?\" in French, literally \"You have a car?\"  – Nick Anderegg, \n  (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-support\" rel=\"nofollow\">Do-support</a> - though there seems to be some controversy between grammarians and linguists)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additional traits might be gleaned from <a href=\"http://rara.linguist.de/\" rel=\"nofollow\">these published works</a>, but I could only preview some of them (no university access at the moment).</p>\n\n<p>*A trivial feature would be, for example, no language spells \"horse\" like English.</p>\n", "Id":"2459", "ParentId":"2427", "LastEditorUserId":"1242", "CreationDate":"2012-08-24T13:38:16.663", "OwnerUserId":"1242", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-05T02:48:42.543", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "WebsiteUrl":"http://n/a", "Id":"1242", "AccountId":"1438398", "CreationDate":"2012-08-08T18:41:37.320", "AboutMe":"<p>Here I am!
