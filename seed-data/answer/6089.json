{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There's a number of other programs out there as well, but a lot have flaws. Having control over what you can search and what your outputs are is really useful, so you'll need to learn some regular expressions and a wee bit of coding (not much, I promise!). The <a href=\"http://nltk.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural Language ToolKit</a> can do this nicely if you're willing to learn a bit of python. I'd also recommend <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0415962706\" rel=\"nofollow\">QCLWR</a> but the learning curve is a bit higher for R than for python. R and python are both free, btw. </p>\n", "Id":"6089", "ParentId":"6034", "CreationDate":"2013-12-07T20:26:30.100", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2838", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-07T20:26:30.100", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2838", "AccountId":"3697576", "CreationDate":"2013-12-07T20:18:53.400", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"26", "Location":"California", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"11", "DisplayName":"wugology", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-12T07:26:37.063"}}
