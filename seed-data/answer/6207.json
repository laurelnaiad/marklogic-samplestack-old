{"Body":"<p>The two words are, actually, <code>kisfan (كِسْفًا)</code> and <code>kisafan (كِسَفًا)</code>. They are <a href=\"http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=ksf\" rel=\"nofollow\">derived</a> from the triliteral root <strong>k-s-f</strong> (kāf-sīn-fā, ك س ف) with the general meaning of \"fragments, pieces, lumps, to shatter, to make into fragments\". Both words are indefinite <em>singular</em> masculine nouns in the Accusative Case. The case ending, <strong>tanwīn fatḥ</strong> over the letter <strong>alif</strong> (ـًا‎) is an obvious sign the nouns are singular. Still, the second noun, <code>kisafan (كِسَفًا)</code>, can be used as a collective noun, it can be translated like \"a piece\", \"(in) pieces\", \"a fragment\", \"fragments\". The first noun, <code>kisfan (كِسْفًا)</code>, is \"a portion\", \"a part\", \"a fragment\".</p>\n\n<p>As for looking up words in Arabic dictionaries, you must find out their root first. It is easy with triliteral roots like in these words, but when the root contains <strong>y</strong> or <strong>w</strong>, those consonants can disappear in some forms, which makes looking up such words a bit more difficult. In <a href=\"http://www.studyquran.co.uk/LLhome.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lane's Lexicon</a> our root <strong>k-s-f</strong> is not found, it must be on <a href=\"http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume7/00000141.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> of volume 7, and it is there, in the lower left corner, but without any translation, \"See Supplement\" is only written there. In the supplement, which is in the end of volume 8, there is again <a href=\"http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume8/00000254.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a reference</a> (in the center of the page) to still another word (بال), its root is <strong>b-w-l</strong> with the <strong>w</strong> disappearing, it is <a href=\"http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume1/00000314.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but there is nothing interesting about <strong>k-s-f</strong> in that article.</p>\n", "Id":"6207", "ParentId":"6205", "LastEditorUserId":"2689", "CreationDate":"2013-12-20T22:15:14.473", "OwnerUserId":"2689", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-20T22:35:36.953", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "Location":"Ukraine", "DownVotes":"12", "Id":"2689", "AccountId":"2118122", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"828", "CreationDate":"2013-11-06T08:33:33.413", "DisplayName":"Yellow Sky", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:45:10.363", "AboutMe":"<p>I've been working as a teacher of English and German for more than 10 years already.
