Igbo (Ibo), a language of approximately 18 million\n  speakers in Nigeria, does not have verbs at all. Instead, Igbo uses clusters termed ‘inherent complement verbs’ (ICV) that have the structure <em>–gbá</em> plus a noun. The root <em>gbá</em> is the only root in Igbo “devoid of meaning”, and the most productive one (Chinedu Uchechukwu, p.c.; see also Uchechukwu 2004). Here are some examples of Igbo clusters: <em>–gbá egwú</em> ‘dance a dance’ — <em>egwú</em> ‘dance’, –<em>gbá igwè</em> ‘ride a bicycle’ — <em>igwè</em> ‘bicycle’, <em>–gbá ákụ́/egbè</em> ‘shoot’ — <em>àkụ́</em> ‘arrow’/<em>égbè</em> ‘gun’, <em>gbá ụkwụ́</em> ‘kick’ — <em>ụ́kwụ</em> ‘foot’, <em>–gbá ọsọ</em> ‘run a race’ — <em>ọsọ</em> ‘race’, <em>–gbá motò</em> ‘travel with a vehicle’ — <em>motò</em> ‘vehicle’, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2219", "ParentId":"2216", "CreationDate":"2012-07-06T16:56:11.173", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-06T16:56:11.173", "CommentCount":"2"}
