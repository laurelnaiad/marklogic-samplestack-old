{"Body":"<p>I would not know what you call linguistics in its modern meaning\n(probably not the same thing I would). Linguistics has so many\naspects. Were grammarians in former centuries doing linguistics? What\nof Alexandrine grammarians, though their work was not quite similar to\nlater grammarians a millenium later (and some). What of these later\ngrammarians ? Grammatical concepts evolved slowly and I suspect (I am\nonly an amateur) often with prescriptive rather than descriptive\nintent at first (e.g. the Académie Française in the 17th century).</p>\n\n<p>Neverthelees, the Greek civilisation was very adept at analysing texts\nand discourse (is that modern linguistics?). It actually lead to the\ndiscovery of logic and rhetorics. And logic happens to be now, in\nvarious guises, a fondamental ingredient of language analysis.</p>\n\n<p>They started things, and building up concepts and organized thought\nand knowledge is a very long process of evolution. This brings\nquestions on the structure of this evolution, But it is probably not\nthe place to ask.</p>\n\n<p>Were the Greeks doing modern physics. Well, they knew some laws. Does\nthat qualifies them even though they knew nothing of the modern\ndescription of the world, of the standard model, of atoms and\nelectromagnetism, or of gauge theories. Archimedes is indeed\nconsidered a great physicist.</p>\n\n<p><em>Post-scriptum</em></p>\n\n<p>I just found by chance a very relevant reference, though <strong>Indian</strong> rather\nthan Greek or Roman. According to Wikipedia, the Indian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanskrit grammarian\nPāṇini</a> did very early work in the 4th century BC, that apparently had\na strong influence on modern linguistics. Still according to\nWikioedia, Pāṇini's work is purely grammatical and lexicographic\n(Sanskrit morphology).</p>\n\n<p>In his monograph <a href=\"http://www.helsinki.fi/esslli/courses/readers/K54.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mathematical Linguistics</a>,\nAndrás Kornai starts the foreword as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mathematical linguistics is rooted both in Euclid's (325BCE ­ 265BCE)\n  axiomatic method and in Pāṇini's (520BCE ­ 460BCE) method of\n  grammatical description.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pāṇini's contribution was first noted here by Gaston Ümlaut, in a\n<a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/6064#comment-13953\">comment above</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So that may be another proof that our early forefathers\ndid real science, ... and that it was not limited to Greece or Rome and the Mediterranean area as western\nculture would sometimes have it.</p>\n", "Id":"6065", "ParentId":"6064", "LastEditorUserId":"2129", "CreationDate":"2013-12-04T02:25:47.873", "OwnerUserId":"2129", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-06T12:40:36.160", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"15", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zegup.png", "Id":"2129", "AccountId":"2350982", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"246", "CreationDate":"2013-06-03T21:52:14.630", "DisplayName":"babou", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T10:17:24.477", "AboutMe":"<p>The name Babou was given to me by my grandson (two years old at the time).
