{"Body":"<p>Americans have very long open vowels when speaking so when they sing the don't sound very different.<br>\nMany people with different accents sing with long open vowels too, so they do sound very American.<br>\nBut not everyone sings like that - some people hold on to their accent more than others do when singing so they don't sound like an American.</p>\n\n<p>You guys can argue all you want on this topic but I think it's true.</p>\n\n<p>Some people read this and probably didn't want to believe it because they thought it would be an insult to their accent to sound American, but it's not necessarily sounding American - it's just having long open vowels when you're singing, which you're supposed to do.
