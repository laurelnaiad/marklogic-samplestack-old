However, most computational linguists are focused on statistical models, which are productive for real-world application, but run counter to the field of theoretical linguistics. Statistics simply plays no role in <em>human</em> language.</p>\n\n<p>The mismatch in approaches results in both fields largely ignoring one another.</p>\n\n<p>Be that as it may, many theoretical models, such as LFG and HPSG, incorporate discoveries and approaches from computational linguistics. The fields are not entirely mutually exclusive, just for the most part.</p>\n", "Id":"268", "ParentId":"150", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T15:11:13.703", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"164", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-18T15:11:13.703", "CommentCount":"3"}
