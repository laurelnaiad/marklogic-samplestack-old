Anything else seems like a poor model to me.</p>\n\n<p>Historical categories don't remain the same. Just because the etymology of \"mouse\" is still transparent, it doesn't mean it's still both the same lexeme.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, concepts such as \"polysemy\" and \"homonymy\" are made up by linguists; I don't expect them to have psychological reality. But that doesn't mean we can't use them to model semantics, just as we use terms such as antonyms, meronyms, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Be that as it may, there are certainly several competing defintions of homonymy and polysemy, so it's kind of wrong to argue which one is \"right\".</p>\n", "Id":"3880", "ParentId":"3672", "CreationDate":"2013-06-19T22:35:44.660", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1380", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-19T22:35:44.660", "CommentCount":"1"}
