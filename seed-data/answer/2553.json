{"Body":"<p>I'm going to try to live up to <a href=\"http://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/chaplaincy/judaism.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hillel's example</a> and try to give you an answer short enough to answer while standing on one leg: <em>It depends on which consonants are in the root, and where they fall.</em></p>\n\n<p>Take the ordinary \"vanilla\" verb כתב (to write). The masculine singular present form in the pa'al binyan is כּוֹתֵב. There are many similar verbs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דוֹפֵק (dofayk)<br>\n  פּוֹגֵשׁ (pogaysh)<br>\n  צוֹבֵט (tsovayt)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and so on. (The vowel represented by a pair of dots sounds somewhat like the \"ay\" in the English \"bay,\" though it's not a diphthong. Remember that Hebrew goes from right to left, so this is the final vowel in the words.)</p>\n\n<p>But there are several consonants that throw a wrench into the works: \n א ה ח י ו נ ע    They have subtle sounds, some of which are or were guttural (pronounced in the throat). They generally influence the infix vowels in a predictable (\"regular\") way, but sometimes they do something oddball, and sometimes they fall out entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Let's say you have ה in the final position. Now the pattern becomes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שׁוֹתֶה (shoeteh)<br>\n  רוֹצֶה (roetzeh)<br>\n  קוֹנֶה (koeneh)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, \"eh\" represents a vowel like the one in English \"bet,\" followed by an \"h\" sound. The vowel has become shortened from the \"ay\" examples above. So that's what you might call a regular irregular pattern. Whenever you have final ה, that's what you'll see.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, final ע causes a change:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שׁוֹמֵעַ (shomay'a)<br>\n  פּוֹגֵעַ (pogay'a)<br>\n  יוֹדֵעַ (yoday'a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Note that פּוֹגֵעַ is the masculine singular present form of the verb in the active pa'al binyan; above, you had פַּגוּעַ, which is in the passive pu'al binyan.)</p>\n\n<p>But there are some oddities. One of the verbs you chose, ישנ, is one of them. The initial י is the reason for the weirdness, but other words that begin with that letter are more regular (for example, יוֹדֵעַ, one of the verbs I listed above). Fortunately, this kind of weirdness is not common enough to hide the more regular patterns. Other oddities are the adjective-like verbs like צרכ, whose forms are quite different in the present, but I believe those can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p>\n\n<p>I really like Lewis Glinert's <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0415101905\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Modern Hebrew: An Essential Grammar</em></a>, which is clear, practical, and thorough, but not scholarly. He goes into the subject of vowel changes within the binyanim in detail.  </p>\n\n<p>I confess that I didn't stand on one leg while I typed this, but I hope I at least answered your basic question and didn't squelch your interest in learning more.</p>\n", "Id":"2553", "ParentId":"2282", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2012-09-13T11:52:17.777", "OwnerUserId":"1328", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-13T15:00:15.200", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
