{"Body":"<p>There are some languages where the inclusive forms clearly pattern separately from the second person forms. One such language I've studied is Walmajarri, an Australia language. Here are the subject agreement markers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>       singular  dual         plural\n1      -rna\n1 exc            -rli         -rlipa\n1 inc            -tjarra      -rna-()-lu\n2      -n        -n-()-pilla  -n-()-lu\n3      -0        -()-pilla    -()-lu\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See <em>The pronominal clitic complex in Walmajarri</em> by Fritz Schweiger (Folia Linguistica Historica, 28(1-2), 251â€“268) for the full details. The brackets indicate where an object marker may be inserted, which could be considered an infix. (For those markers without brackets the object marker is inserted afterwards.)</p>\n\n<p>If the first person inclusive markers were fundamentally second person then we would expect them to begin with an /-n/. Instead, the first person plural inclusive form /-rnalu/ is the same as the first person singular form /-rna/, but with the common plural marker. The first person exclusive forms are unrelated.</p>\n", "Id":"4663", "ParentId":"4631", "LastEditorUserId":"2555", "CreationDate":"2013-10-09T00:53:43.580", "OwnerUserId":"2555", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-09T07:42:17.143", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"70", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"2555", "DownVotes":"16", "AccountId":"3401915", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"311", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:31:40.093", "DisplayName":"curiousdannii", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T22:35:43.143", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-09T07:42:17.143", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"70", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"2555", "DownVotes":"16", "AccountId":"3401915", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"311", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:31:40.093", "DisplayName":"curiousdannii", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T22:35:43.143", "AboutMe":""}}
