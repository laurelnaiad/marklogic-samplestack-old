{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The answer is probably that pidgin and creole languages are easier to learn. First, they tend to be not especially complicated formally: you are not going to find a pidgin/creole language with multiple tone levels, scores of obstruent consonants, or Iroquoian-style inflectional paradigms. Second, and probably just as importantly, a pidgin/creole doesn't really belong to anyone, so there is little resistance to outsiders using it, and it is not a turnoff when a novice speaks it badly. In the specific personal history of the OP, however, there is no guarantee that this applies.</p>\n", "Id":"2248", "ParentId":"2238", "CreationDate":"2012-07-14T04:26:48.033", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-14T04:26:48.033", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
