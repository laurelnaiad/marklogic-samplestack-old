Basque is the most obvious - clearly not Indo-European, and indeed clearly pre-Indo-European, and yet spoken by people that are genetically very European. Sumerian and maybe Elamite might have also been counterexamples - they've since been replaced by Semitic languages (> Aramaic > Arabic in the case of Sumerian) or Indo-European languages ( > Persian in the case of Elamite), despite the fact that neither language was anything like either Semitic or Indo-European (or each other) and the fact that the people that spoke them were never 'replaced' with anyone else.</p>\n", "Id":"3813", "ParentId":"3810", "CreationDate":"2013-06-04T23:59:57.060", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-04T23:59:57.060", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"13", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2132", "AccountId":"2572199", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"701", "CreationDate":"2013-06-04T23:59:57.060", "DisplayName":"Sjiveru", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T21:42:32.287", "AboutMe":"<p>Still in training, but hopefully somewhat knowledgeable.
