{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The most common way for new languages to form is fairly regular.  When two cultures meet, the dominant culture's language forms the basis for a pidgen in which those in the less dominant culture try to accomodate the dominant language while using grammatical structures, vocabulary, and metaphors/symbols from their own language.  Once a complete language develops from these, it's often called a creole which has elements from both languages, including the metaphoric/symbolic imagery from each--(at the same time, the creole simplifies the grammar/syntax of the original).  So the idiom is usually a metaphor which meant something concrete in the original language but which has taken on a more abstract meaning in the creole--which is then a real language.  English went through this process, absorbing symbols and metaphors while simplifying forms. Sometimes individuals create idioms which go on to be applied to many things; for instance, Shakespeare:  wild goose chase, the crack of doom, as pure as the driven snow, and many more. America added many:  well healed, on the wagon, off the record, +++.  It's a fascinating study.</p>\n", "Id":"2232", "ParentId":"2227", "CreationDate":"2012-07-11T02:17:47.160", "Score":"-3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1177", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-11T02:17:47.160", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1177", "AccountId":"1644700", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2012-07-11T02:17:47.177", "DisplayName":"bob sauerbrey", "LastAccessDate":"2012-07-11T02:17:47.177"}}
