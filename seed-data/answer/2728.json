{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I think the point is that making prescriptive rules is not what linguists are supposed to do. Prescriptivism is not that bad per se, and I think it is unavoidable, especially in written language. When we write, we can be less sloppy than when we speak, because we have time to formulate our thoughts clearly and concisely. Encouraging this should be a good thing. But this is a job for educators and editors. That said, the prescriptive rules can be of use for sociolinguists, because they can tell them which variety of a language has high status.</p>\n", "Id":"2728", "ParentId":"155", "CreationDate":"2012-10-21T08:44:13.683", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1426", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-21T08:44:13.683", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1426", "AccountId":"134622", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"85", "CreationDate":"2012-10-20T17:38:59.567", "DisplayName":"michau", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-16T17:43:22.383"}}
