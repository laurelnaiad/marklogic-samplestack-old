For example: \"The players gave <strong><em>their teammates high fives</em></strong>.\" \"The players gave high fives to their teammates.\"\n  When two noun phrases follow a transitive verb, the first is an indirect object, that which is receiving something, and the second is a direct object, that being acted upon. Indirect objects can be noun phrases or prepositional phrases.</p>\n  \n  <p>Transitive Verbs: Vc verbs</p>\n  \n  <p>Vc verbs (named after the verb consider) are followed by a noun phrase that serves as a direct object and then a second noun phrase, adjective, or infinitive phrase. The second element (noun phrase, adjective, or infinitive) is called a complement, which completes a clause that would not otherwise have the same meaning. For example: \"The young couple considers <strong><em>the neighbors wealthy people</em></strong>.\" \"Some students perceive adults quite inaccurately.\" \"Sarah deemed her project to be the hardest she has ever completed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"4156", "ParentId":"4075", "CreationDate":"2013-08-10T16:52:03.727", "Score":"-1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2254", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-10T16:52:03.727", "CommentCount":"1"}
