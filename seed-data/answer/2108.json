{"Body":"<p>At first, some important remarks on animacy.</p>\n\n<p>Animacy is more like a continuum, meaning that it doesn't behave like a dichotomy (animate or inanimate) but rather \"a more or less continuous category ranging from most animate to least animate\" (Croft 2003: 130), cf. Dixon's animacy hierarchy, human &lt; animate &lt; inanimate. This is semantic animacy or what Croft calls \"animacy proper.\" Obviously, it is language-specific. For example, trees are inanimate in Slavic languages whereas they are animate in Algonquian languages (Plungian 2011: 142, n.47).</p>\n\n<p>Interesting examples from <strong>Russian</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><em>trup</em> 'a dead body' [inanimate]</p>\n\n<p><em>pokojnik</em> or <em>mertvets</em> 'a dead person' [animate] (from Plungian)</p>\n\n<p>A Wikipedia article on animacy (its Russian version) aslo mentions cases when the same noun can be both animate and inanimate (with no difference in meaning), e.g. <em>virus</em> 'virus' or <em>robot</em> 'robot'.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples from <strong>Dyirbal</strong> (Dixon 1972)</p>\n\n<p>non-human animates: some birds, moon, storms, rainbow, boomerangs, some spears, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to make things more complicated, this semantic animacy interacts with many other things, like definiteness, referentiality etc. (the extended animacy hierarchy).
