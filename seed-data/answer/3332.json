{"Body":"<p>I have heard the term \"tritransitive\" for verbs that are said to take four arguments. One example in English is this <code>She(1) bet me(2) ten euros(3) that they won't show up(4)</code>. As you can see, this is different from your example with causatives, because the fourth argument taken by the main verb <code>bet</code> is the whole <em>that</em>-clause. If I recall correctly, causative constructions have been analyzed as having only two or exactly three arguments. A problem for the analysis of any construction with regard to argument structure is to determine whether two or more arguments are taken by the same predicate, and thus are <em>coarguments</em>. You need syntactic and semantic evidence to prove that a verb can have four arguments, and as far as I know, causatives are not part of that kind of verbs. I'm sorry I can't tell you anything else about argument structure outside Germanic and Romance linguistics.     </p>\n", "Id":"3332", "ParentId":"3327", "LastEditorUserId":"1754", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T09:24:28.800", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-08T12:59:26.490", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q8I3U.jpg", "Id":"1754", "AccountId":"2338821", "CreationDate":"2013-02-12T08:06:32.000", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a linguistics student interested in semantics.
