{"Body":"<p><em>edit</em>: I had almost forgotten about the existence of <strong>WALS</strong>. Chapter 35 gives an overview of plurality in independent personal pronouns: <a href=\"http://wals.info/chapter/35\">http://wals.info/chapter/35</a></p>\n\n<p>It looks like the category most relevant to your question is type 8 (person stem with a nominal plural affix). If you look at the map on WALS, you can see 19 type 8 languages listed, many of which have been mentioned here, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Southern US English. Type 3 (person-number affixes) and type 7 (person stem with a pronominal number affix) might also be of interest to you, as they show some morphological complexity in the expression of number in the pronominal system.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, it looks like it's far more common <em>not</em> to have a morphologically transparent pronominal system, like English. The morphologically transparent pronominal systems are in a small minority.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Several meso-melanesian languages have morphologically complex pronominal systems, including number marking on plural pronouns. One example:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Babatana</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1sg exclusive = <em>ra</em></li>\n<li>1dual exc. = <em>raru</em></li>\n<li>1pl exc. = <em>rami</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Kubokota, another meso-melanesian language is especially interesting, in that the plural form is suppletive, but the dual and trial forms are morphologically complex, with the plural form as a stem:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kubokota</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1sg. exc. = <em>ara</em></li>\n<li>1pl. exc = <em>yami</em></li>\n<li>1dual exc = <em>yami-kori</em></li>\n<li>1trial exc = <em>yami-kue</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>'Nominal Number in Meso-Melanesian' (Palmer, 2012): <a href=\"http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/LFG/17/papers/lfg12palmer.pdf\">http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/LFG/17/papers/lfg12palmer.pdf</a></p>\n", "Id":"4151", "ParentId":"4145", "LastEditorUserId":"2328", "CreationDate":"2013-08-10T11:33:02.903", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-10T11:53:01.957", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
