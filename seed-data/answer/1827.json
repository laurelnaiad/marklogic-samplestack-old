It could be, of course, but it could also be that the writer knows that a particular addressee is really dense and needs a lot more explicit explanation, or maybe the writer addresses a very short paragraph to another person because the writer knows that person won't read anything longer than 50 words.</p>\n\n<p>Would you be better to analyze the different lexical items, style, etc., used in the paragraphs to particular people? Does the writer use any pet names? Any diminutives? What tenses? These things are all quantifiable, and research has been done in this area. Off the top of my head I'm not sure what might indicate addressee importance, but you could get a benchmark from looking at other people's writings to important people (or maybe better yet, if you KNOW a particular addressee of the writer in question was very important) to look for trends. </p>\n", "Id":"1827", "ParentId":"1824", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T23:04:25.570", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"908", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-19T23:04:25.570", "CommentCount":"1"}
