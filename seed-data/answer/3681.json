{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I don't know much about Catalan, but based on the example it seems like a more accurate analysis is that nasals assimilate in place to following obstruents and then word-final non-continuants undergo deletion. So:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>/ben+k/ --> beŋk</li>\n<li>beŋk --> [beŋ]</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This interaction is opaque because once the word-final consonant is deleted we no longer see on the surface what triggered the place assimilation in the nasal. </p>\n\n<p>These rules, ordered how they are, are in a counterbleeding relationship. If word-final non-continuant deletion happened first, then there would be nothing to trigger the nasal place assimilation. In other words, the deletion would <em>bleed</em> the assimilation. But as they stand the rules are in the opposite--<em>counterbleeding</em>--order. This kind of opacity results in a surface form that appears as though a certain rule (in this case the nasal place assimilation) has \"overapplied\".</p>\n\n<p>I hope that's clear! Feeding, bleeding, counterfeeding, and counterbleeding can be kind of confusing.</p>\n", "Id":"3681", "ParentId":"3678", "CreationDate":"2013-05-09T14:46:05.007", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"385", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-09T14:46:05.007", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
