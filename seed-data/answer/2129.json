{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I had the opportunity to talk about this issue with a Chinese linguist who is teaching a class I'm auditing at Fudan University.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese-linguists have traditionally used the term \"apical vowel\" (and the otherwise unseen characters ɿ and ʅ) to describe the nucleus of the \"zhi chi shi ri\" and \"zi ci si\" syllables. The textbook we used was no exception.</p>\n\n<p>As others have pointed out, these are often analyzed (or at least written as) syllabic fricatives by the linguistics community at large. I wasn't sure if my professor knew this, so I brought it up with him after class.</p>\n\n<p>He was actually quite insistent that there is no frication in nuclei of these syllables (and was able to pronounce the syllables in a way consistent with that hypothesis). We eventually agreed that there was a fair amount of variation among Chinese people as to the realization of these phonemes.</p>\n\n<p>So, if and when they're produced without frication, what <em>are</em> they? The retroflex one can be analyzed as a syllabic-retroflex-approximant. The apical one is harder, as both the front and the middle of the tongue are raised quite close to the roof of the mouth. A bit like a [ ɨ ] with the front of the tongue raised slightly.</p>\n", "Id":"2129", "ParentId":"552", "CreationDate":"2012-06-18T15:07:46.567", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1115", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-18T15:07:46.567", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"47", "WebsiteUrl":"http://peterthenelson.com", "Id":"1115", "AccountId":"1331637", "CreationDate":"2012-06-18T12:58:59.783", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm interested in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All things Chinese</li>\n<li>Historical linguistics and etymology</li>\n<li>Computationally sane models of grammar</li>\n<li>People who are not Noam Chomsky</li>\n</ul>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"251", "DisplayName":"Stumpy Joe Pete", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-10T22:34:12.867"}}
