For example, if you are korean or chinese, you may find hard the pronunciation, but if your mother tongue is Spanish, it is quite easy to learn the language. Don't forget that English comes exceptionally from a the German division of languages in the proto-indoeuropean model. However, there aren't many inflections as in Deutsch. Besides, there is no genre. So, the complexity of a language should be in terms of comparison with your mother tongue, and taking into account all the aspects of it.\nEnglish would be easy in terms of syntax, since you cannot change the words as you do in those that come from romance languages, and it woul be easy in comparison to those language where yoy seem to use symbols more that written phonemes, but it is still complex in some cases, above all, when you are in a upper-advanced level and you deal with literary English, and I'd say it depends on the epoch it is spoken. Why is Shakespeare rather complex for us, contemporaneous speakers?</p>\n", "Id":"2404", "ParentId":"2386", "CreationDate":"2012-08-09T14:20:41.323", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1245", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-09T14:20:41.323", "CommentCount":"2"}
