{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There are several quite complex statistical models that try to deal with this, with various degrees of success. Phrase based systems, linguistically perhaps a misnomer as the phrases have nothing to do with syntax at all, tend to be able to alleviate this somewhat. Phrases are found by looking at paralell corpora. Hierarchal phrase based systems can work even better. Instead of translating word by word, the system tries to translate complete phrases. The trouble with all these models is that it's very difficult to estimate the parameters in an acceptable way, there just isn't enough data. Furthermore, the models quite quickly get computationally very expensive, both in time and space.</p>\n\n<p>It is common though, to construct a big n-gram language model of the <em>target</em> language, and use that to rerank complete sentences. This can deal with small differences in word order, for instance if the adjective goes to the left or the right of the noun it modifies, as the correct word order will typically have a much higher likelihood assigned to it by the model. As n-grams have limited length in practice, the model fails when the movement is big, as in English to German. In that case, the language model reranking usually only works for short sentences, where the movement is inside the <em>n</em> of the n-grams.</p>\n", "Id":"495", "ParentId":"387", "CreationDate":"2011-09-24T15:43:43.180", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"47", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-24T15:43:43.180", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"19", "Location":"Oslo, Norway", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"47", "AccountId":"38561", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"286", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:06:25.687", "DisplayName":"johanbev", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-26T11:45:13.660", "AboutMe":"<p>Student.</p>\n"}}
