{"Body":"<p>There is <a href=\"http://www.linguistik-online.de/43_10/fabunmi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a paper</a> that gives an overview of the additive, subtractive and multiplicative derivations of number-words as used in the three dialects of Yoruba. </p>\n\n<p>I'll quote a few things here, but the number system is far too complicated, and needs the paper I linked to to describe it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the first pattern, it uses addition solely to derive the number words but with a counting pattern where 'ten', 'twenty' and the added number units are taken as a whole. In the second counting pattern, subtraction is used to derive number words but this is applicable only to three numbers i. e. seventeen – /mɛ́ɛtadínóɡu/, eighteen – /méèʤìdínóɡu/ and nineteen – /mɔkɔdínóɡ́u/.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most importantly, the idea expressed in [Standard Yoruba] and [Yoruba Ifè Nigeria] ... is 1 + 10, 2 + 10, 3 + 10, 4 + 10 for eleven to fourteen; and 20 - 5, 20 - 4, 20 - 3, 20 - 2, 20 - 1 for fifteen to nineteen; twenty (ogún) is a \n  basic word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The paper also compares the preferences of the older and newer generations of people when it comes to specific numbers.</p>\n", "Id":"2703", "ParentId":"2685", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2012-10-17T13:02:07.593", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-17T13:16:43.130", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-17T13:16:43.130", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
