Instead, language changes put pressure on other parts of the language to change, either through analogy or a need to disambiguate things which have been conflated.</p>\n\n<p>As to the evidence, processes like grammaticalization and periphrasis can been seen in a lot of languages; and those that have a long enough written record bear testimony to going back and forthâ€”perhaps not always in a full cycle but certainly oscillating between alternatives, neither of which is any more stable than the other.</p>\n", "Id":"462", "ParentId":"460", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T17:54:43.470", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"165", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-23T17:54:43.470", "CommentCount":"2"}
