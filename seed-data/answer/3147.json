{"Body":"<p>It was too long for the comment, so had to post it as an answer. As a native speaker of several languages, when I talk to someone who is also proficient in these languages I select:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>a word that is shorter in one language</li>\n<li>a word that expresses more</li>\n<li>a word that is easier to articulate</li>\n<li>a word that is used and heard more frequently in one language. For example, such words as midterms, finals, papers are generally used in English because I study in English medium university and I hear them more frequently, than in my mother tongue.</li>\n<li>a word that has association with past or something special, for example denoting the group from which I came. </li>\n<li>and for constructions generally those that express more.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are my observations of myself and my friends. It is clear that some factors are stronger than others such as 4, but I think more research could be done on this topic.</p>\n", "Id":"3147", "ParentId":"3141", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2013-01-30T00:47:07.283", "OwnerUserId":"1469", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-30T11:35:23.133", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
