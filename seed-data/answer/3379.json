{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I don't think that the expletive insertion could work for <code>The boy was rumoured</code> but not for <code>The boys were rumoured</code>. Your test sentence <code>It was rumoured that the boys did so</code> indeed proves that <code>be rumoured</code> is a <strong>raising predicate</strong>. Look at your wrong result: <code>*It were rumoured to have done so</code>. Of course it's unacceptable because it doesn't have the (CP) that-clause that you used in the correct expletive test. If I recall correctly, this kind of clauses prevent the subject to be raised, but the expletive comes to the rescue. The verb has to agree with the expletive, not with a noun phrase that is blocked for movement. That's why you get <code>it was</code> and not <code>*it were</code>.   </p>\n", "Id":"3379", "ParentId":"3375", "CreationDate":"2013-03-13T13:56:10.867", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-13T13:56:10.867", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q8I3U.jpg", "Id":"1754", "AccountId":"2338821", "CreationDate":"2013-02-12T08:06:32.000", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a linguistics student interested in semantics.
