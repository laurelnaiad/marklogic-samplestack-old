{"Body":"<p>I do know of at least one example in Latin where a feminine noun is given as a name to a male, namely <em><a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext:1999.04.0059%3aentry=cupido\" rel=\"nofollow\">cupido</a></em>, a normally feminine noun meaning \"desire\", but given to the male deity <em>Cupido</em> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cupid</a> in English).</p>\n\n<p>You restrict your question to given names, though I think family names might be more likely to exist with a mismatch between grammatical and natural gender.  In Spanish, for example, family names do not have to be words of the same gender as the referent, i.e., a woman can have the surname <em>Delgado</em> (<em>delgado</em>, a masculine word meaning \"skinny, slender\") and a man can have the surname <em>Vega</em> (<em>vega</em>, a feminine word meaning \"meadow\").   The same thing of course happens in English (a woman can be called <em>Johnson</em> even though <em>son</em> is masculine), but compare Russian and other Slavic languages, where surnames usually change form depending on whether they are given to a male or a female; a man's surname can be <em>Толстой</em> (Tolstoj, from <em>толстый</em> = \"stout\") but his wife or daughter will have the feminine form <em>Толстая</em> (Tolstaja).</p>\n", "Id":"1942", "ParentId":"1937", "LastEditorUserId":"472", "CreationDate":"2012-05-16T13:11:00.957", "OwnerUserId":"472", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-16T13:21:20.480", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"472", "AccountId":"1010298", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"300", "CreationDate":"2011-11-01T23:30:01.573", "DisplayName":"Muke Tever", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-12T17:28:00.543", "AboutMe":"<p>I like to split hairs.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-16T13:21:20.480", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"472", "AccountId":"1010298", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"300", "CreationDate":"2011-11-01T23:30:01.573", "DisplayName":"Muke Tever", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-12T17:28:00.543", "AboutMe":"<p>I like to split hairs.</p>\n"}}
