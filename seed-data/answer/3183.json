{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There is something fairly close to what you're talking about, which is the Speech Accent Archive someone above mentioned: <a href=\"http://accent.gmu.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://accent.gmu.edu/</a></p>\n\n<p>This is a collection of speakers from different regions and with different native languages (there are a lot of native English speakers from various regions but also non-native English speakers with various native languages) reading the same short passage. The passage is a little bit weird but I believe it was designed to include as much of the English phonological inventory as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Entries in the Speech Accent Archive include the speaker's birthplace, current place of residence, age at time of recording, native languages, other languages spoken, age at which they began learning English, where they lived that English was spoken, and how long they've lived there.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the passages have been transcribed in IPA, but unfortunately not all. I'm not sure how new transcriptions are added.</p>\n", "Id":"3183", "ParentId":"3043", "CreationDate":"2013-02-10T22:05:09.380", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"771", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-10T22:05:09.380", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"771", "AccountId":"1252240", "CreationDate":"2012-02-15T21:16:15.190", "AboutMe":"<p>Linguistics graduate student.</p>\n\n<p>Research interests: Sociolinguistics, sociophonetics, language attitudes, Asian American English, attitudes toward accented English and ethnolects.</p>\n", "Age":"32", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "DisplayName":"funnyletter", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-21T03:53:00.450"}}
