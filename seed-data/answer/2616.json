Horses have drawbacks and limitations compared with cars as a means of transportation, but one big advantage of horses is that they can make more horses without a factory, or even any education. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that most people in a community are literate does not automatically result in the children of that community becoming literate, the way a common language generates new speakers (or signers). They have to go to school -- no school, no literacy.</p>\n\n<p>But they all speak or sign, whether they're literate or not.</p>\n", "Id":"2616", "ParentId":"2615", "comments":[], "CreationDate":"2012-09-24T21:12:19.203", "Score":"10", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-24T21:12:19.203", "CommentCount":"6"}
