{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>You'll find a decent overview of valency-changing processes, with some comments on the term <em>middle</em> in <a href=\"http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99024413.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dixon &amp; Aikhenvald (2000: secs.3--5, esp. pp.11--12)</a>, and references therein. Those authors suggest that the term is used with a wide variety of senses, and recommend that it be avoided (almost) altogether because of its ambiguity. Rather than insert a long block quote, I'd encourage interested people to just click through to the PDF and read the passage on pp.11--12.</p>\n\n<p>Two works that Dixon and Aikhenvald cite that may be worth consulting are <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/The_middle_voice.html?id=mQv0QmkTHbMC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kemmer (1993)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4178392?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=55942714153\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keyser &amp; Roeper (1984)</a></p>\n", "Id":"1696", "ParentId":"1695", "CreationDate":"2012-03-24T19:04:37.123", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-24T19:04:37.123", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
