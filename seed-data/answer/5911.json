{"Body":"<p>I don't see any figurative element here either. <em>\"Negative Nancy\"</em> is perceived as having a negative attitude to many things, quite literally. These nicknames may be exaggerations, but that doesn't make them figurative. </p>\n\n<p>A figurative nickname would be <em>\"Thunderstorm Thomas\"</em> to describe an irate person. Thomas is not actually a thunderstorm, but has some quality (compared to other people) that is likened to some quality of a thunderstorm (compared to normal, calm weather).</p>\n\n<p>And as Dominic pointed out, your examples are alliterative - The alliteration makes these nicknames just more catchy.</p>\n", "Id":"5911", "ParentId":"5910", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "CreationDate":"2013-11-15T13:58:46.410", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-15T16:48:21.567", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-15T16:48:21.567", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
