{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It seems that the term you are looking for is <em>phonotactics</em> and it has more to do with phonology than with morphology. Basically, the phonotactics of a language defines what sequences of sounds are allowed (or not allowed) and the basic syllable structure. For example, in Dutch the syllable structure is (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C), where C stands for consonant and V, for vowel. Letters in parentheses indicate optional sounds. Having the basic rules, you can, in theory,  derive the words (even those that don't actually exist in the language).</p>\n\n<p>After a quick search, I could find a small section on Wikipedia about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_phonology#Phonotactics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dutch phonotactics</a>, which, granted, is very superficial. But I bet that if you try more academic sources, you will find more detailed information.</p>\n", "Id":"3157", "ParentId":"3155", "CreationDate":"2013-02-01T11:49:58.940", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-01T11:49:58.940", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
