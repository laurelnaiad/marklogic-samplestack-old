{"Body":"<p>I myself have never heard of \"co-compounds\" before but here's what I've been able to find.</p>\n\n<p>At first, a note on terminology. There is a coordinate compound and there's also a co-compound. These are two different things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A coordinate compound</strong> (sometimes called coordinative compound) is usually understood as compound with two heads (e.g Fabb 2001: 67, Scalise and Bisetto 2009: 46). Under this analysis, \"bittersweet\" is <em>an endocentric coordinate compound</em> (with mixture interpretation, Lieber 2009).</p>\n\n<p><strong>A co-compound</strong> is a \"<em>natural word-like unit consisting of two or more parts which express natural coordination</em>\" (Wälchli 2005: 1). In other words, those coordinated items are closely related in meaning, they are expected to co-occur, they form a conceptual unit, and <strong>the whole meaning is more general than the meaning of its parts</strong>  (Wälchli 2005: 1, 5).</p>\n\n<p>English examples:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>husband and wife, eat and drink, hands and feet</em> etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is why the following are <strong>not</strong> co-compounds, although they are coordinate compounds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>southwest, blue-green</em> (no coordination)</p>\n  \n  <p><em>poet-doctor</em> (no close relationship)</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Austria-Hungary</em> (fusion)</p>\n  \n  <p><em>twenty-two</em> (different hierarchy)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OED defines bittersweet as \"sweet with an admixture or aftertaste of bitterness. <em>fig</em>. agreeable or pleasant with an alloy of pain or unpleasantness.\" As you can see from this definition, the parts, <em>bitter</em> and <em>sweet</em>, are on different hierarchical levels; thus, \"bittersweet\" is <em>not a co-compound</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For further discussion of co-compounds, see <a href=\"http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Linguistics/SyntaxMorphology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199276219\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wälchli 2005</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are many other classifications of compounds; e.g. <strong>under Haspelmath's classification</strong>, <em>bittersweet</em> is <strong>an appositional compound</strong> and not coordinative (Haspelmath and Sims 2010: 141)/copulative (Booij 2007: 80) etc. Next time you ask a question, please define the terms you use.</p>\n", "Id":"1683", "ParentId":"1678", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2012-03-22T18:24:57.533", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-22T22:49:38.170", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
