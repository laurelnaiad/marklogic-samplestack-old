One simple example would be the deduction of the theoretical equation for the Piotrowski law modeling language change by Altmann et al.</p>\n\n<p>The increase of new forms <code>p'</code> is proportional to the product of the proportions <code>p</code> of new and <code>1-p</code> old forms: <code>p' ∝ p(1 - p)</code>. Introducing the factor of proportionality <code>b</code> then yields the differential equation <code>p' = bp(1-p)</code>, which can be solved for <code>p</code> as a function of time: <code>p = 1/(1 + a exp(-bt))</code>. (Skipping a few details here, like Piotrowski's earlier fitting of a tangens hyperbolicus curve, which is compatible with the above, since <code>1/(1 + a exp(-bt)) = 1/2 tanh w(t-t₁) + 1/2</code>, where <code>1/2 tanh w(t-t₁)</code> was one of Piotrowski's original proposals. Also, this can be (and was) generalized for partial change, and there are other viable approaches besides the interactionistic model.)</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in quantitative linguistics, I'd suggest the works of Prof. Gabriel Altmann and Prof. Reinhard Köhler.</p>\n", "Id":"3289", "ParentId":"3287", "CreationDate":"2013-02-26T15:23:01.047", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1393", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-26T15:23:01.047", "CommentCount":"1"}
