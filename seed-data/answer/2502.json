Spanish and its ancestor Latin do not have vowel reduction. If you expand your definition of vowel reduction to include derounding, shortening, devoicing, elision, ATR movement, monophthongization, and so on, then languages like Japanese would have vowel reduction. Fast speech does not count for vowel reduction—everything \"reduces\" when people speak quickly, but that's not a property of the phonological system. </p>\n\n<p>Vowel reduction must be phonetic and not phonemic or else another word is being formed: If you had the word [bula] and it \"reduced\" to [bʊla], but [bʊla] was another word in the language (/ʊ/ is a phoneme), then you would be dealing with homophony.</p>\n", "Id":"2502", "ParentId":"2447", "CreationDate":"2012-09-01T04:42:39.847", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1298", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-01T04:42:39.847", "CommentCount":"1"}
