On of the most interesting works on this kind of effect is Brown and Levinson's book on Politeness (1987). They talk about these things in terms of face - saving your own face and threatening someone elses. They argue that this accounts for a great deal of the choices like 'I think' - which is a hedging strategy to weaken your assertiveness (or in some cases, strengthen it! Language is funny like that).   </p>\n\n<p>Brown, Penelope and Stephen C. Levinson. 1987. Politeness: Some universals in language usage.
