{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>As was said in the comments, just selecting one arbitrarily and sticking to it is probably a bad idea as this could be confusing. Your best options are probably to either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Provide the necessary context so as to resolve the definiteness of what is being referred to.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use 'a/the' in the translation line. An example of this can be found in <a href=\"http://wals.info/chapter/37\" rel=\"nofollow\">the WALS Online entry for definite articles</a> in the example from the Cherokee language. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It probably depends on the purpose of your example. If it is to point out that the language does not possess definite or indefinite articles (as in the Cherokee examples), then the second option would be the way to go, otherwise it's up to you I guess.</p>\n", "Id":"2885", "ParentId":"2846", "CreationDate":"2012-11-23T02:32:14.000", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"81", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-23T02:32:14.000", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"81", "AccountId":"28887", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"231", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:04:32.127", "DisplayName":"humble coffee", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-14T00:32:37.073"}}
