Pursuing it leads down the fascinating rabbit-hole of so-called \"fine-grained phonetics\", and typically winds up at a theory claiming that people store much more (and much more nuanced) phonetic detail in their mental lexicon (the repository of words in our mind, in particular their sound-meaning(-and-perhaps-spelling) associations).</p>\n\n<p>A good start on the homophone question is the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gahl, S. \"Thyme\" and \"Time\" are not homophones.
