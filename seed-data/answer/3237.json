{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>According to what I have learnt, I wouldn't say that <code>should</code> <strong>is</strong> a tense, but I would say that it <strong>carries</strong> a past tense inflection. And about your idea of T merging with V, I would suggest considering the following. Basically, there is a hypothesis saying that TPs are headed by a T constituent, either overt or null. Merging occurs, but that wouldn't fully explain what happens to T. In your fist example, the head of T is the modal auxiliary verb, but in the finite clause, the T would have a null phonetic spell out of a tense affix which also carries person and number features. The idea is that heads cannot be empty, and in this case the tense affix undergoes a morphological operation called <strong>affix hopping</strong>.  Thus, in the sentence <code>I played the piano</code>, the T head would be something like <code>Tense-3SgPr</code> and it would be lowered onto the head V <code>play</code>. The derived structure would be <code>[play+Affix-3SgPr]</code>, which in turn would be spelled out as <code>played</code>. See Radford (2006) for a more detailed explanation.  </p>\n", "Id":"3237", "ParentId":"3234", "CreationDate":"2013-02-20T09:20:48.980", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-20T09:20:48.980", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q8I3U.jpg", "Id":"1754", "AccountId":"2338821", "CreationDate":"2013-02-12T08:06:32.000", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a linguistics student interested in semantics.
