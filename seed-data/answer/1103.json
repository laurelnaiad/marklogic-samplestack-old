{"Body":"<p>[Here is an answer whose substance was suggested to me by Diana Archangeli]</p>\n\n<p>The form of the OCP I was assuming was a somewhat classical one, more or less like Goldsmith's (1976:272) formulation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>At the phonetic level, any conti[g]uous identical (auto)segments must be\ncollapsed into each other. \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Under this formulation, OCP does not prefer either of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X1  X2   X1 X2\n/\\  |     | /\\\ni i j     i i j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>since it is just evaluating the surface sequence <strong>[i i j]</strong>. However, a <em>generalized</em> OCP, as proposed by Suzuki (1998:64) <em>can</em> distinguish between the two. Here is Suzuki's formulation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Generalized OCP (GOCP)\nIn the scheme *X...X where “...” is intervening material, a sequence of two Xs is\n   prohibited in some domain D.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The key is to recognize that the GOCP could apply cyclically, first at one domain, then at a higher domain, since it can apply to all domains generally. So <strong>[[i i] [j]]</strong> contains two violations of GOCP, first for <strong>[i i]</strong>, then for <strong>[i i j]</strong>, while <strong>[[i] [i j]]</strong> contains only one violation, for <strong>[i i j]</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As @James C. points out, I did not consider representations where one of the featural elements was multiply-linked.
