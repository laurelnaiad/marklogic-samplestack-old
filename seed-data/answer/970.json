{"Body":"<p>You may be interested in <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0816614024\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, a book Felix Guattari co-authored with Gilles Deleuze</a>, in which they discuss Chomskyian linguistics in some depth and with a great deal of care. </p>\n\n<p>Some caution may be warranted: they may seem to take Chomsky rather lightly, and their position may appear to be antithetically opposed in many ways -- you will find them, for instance, arguing against 'tree-based' sentence analysis, promoting in its stead a kind of 'an-hierarchical' or 'rhizomatic' language analysis emphasizing the pragmatic and collective aspects of discourse. However, a careful reading of this work will find a unique encounter with Chomsky's linguistics that is well worth the time to unpack.</p>\n\n<p>They also offer a detailed reading of the Labov-Chomsky debate, which may be of some interest in this context.</p>\n", "Id":"970", "ParentId":"964", "LastEditorUserId":"492", "CreationDate":"2011-11-07T00:54:56.593", "OwnerUserId":"492", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-07T03:22:39.283", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ontology.io", "Id":"492", "AccountId":"32433", "CreationDate":"2011-11-07T00:54:45.457", "AboutMe":"<p>Hi!
