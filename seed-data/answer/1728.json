{"Body":"<p>One further intriguing side note is given by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=cm-VwKgY8jcC&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;ots=eSJWLmw38c&amp;dq=dekm%20kmtom&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q=dekm%20kmtom&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quiles (2007)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...PIE <strong>kmtóm</strong>, <em>hundred</em>, (probably from <strong>*<em>dkmtóm</em></strong>, a zero-grade suffixed\n  form of <strong>dékm</strong>, <em>ten</em>)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>a view closely echoed by <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=nLIufwC4szwC&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;ots=DDKj54wO8o&amp;dq=%22tom%22%20proto-indo-european&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tom%22%20proto-indo-european&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anthony (2007)</a> but without the explicit reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut#Ablaut_in_Proto-Indo-European\" rel=\"nofollow\">ablaut</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...Proto-Indo-European *<em>k’ṃtom</em> probably was a shortened version of\n  *<em>dek’ṃtom</em>, a word that included the Proto-Indo-European root *<em>dek’ṃ</em> 'ten'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>*<strong>dékm</strong> was an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>e</em>-grade form</a> with a zero-grade form <strong>*dkm</strong><sup>1</sup>.  </li>\n<li>*<strong>-tóm</strong> was a suffix. Neither source conjectures as to its nature<sup>2</sup>.</li>\n<li>The initial d of <strong>*dkmtóm</strong> was lost, presumably for phonotactic reasons as happened with <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix%3aProto-Indo-European/d%CA%B0%C3%A9%C7%B5%CA%B0%C5%8Dm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>*dʰ(é)ǵʰōm</strong></a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So those two sources essentially say \"<strong>hundred &lt;- ten + suffix</strong>\". . This is not a complete explanation, but it's certainly suggestive that two of the authors you mention essentially agree. We don't know the nature of the suffix but maybe it's better that we don't, rather than suggest things like \"ten-ness\" or \"units of\". This would give \"ten\" as the older word from which \"hundred\" is derived, which makes sense culturally too</p>\n\n<p><sub><sup>1</sup>In PIE a series of forms like *CéC, *CeC, *CóC, *CoC, *CC were related in a mechanism called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_ablaut#Ablaut_and_grammatical_function\" rel=\"nofollow\">ablaut</a> which was used to express grammatical function.</sub> </p>\n\n<p><sub><sup>2</sup>Although I note that *<em>tom/tóm/tam</em> is reconstructed as an accusative demonstrative or pronoun, e.g. in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher%27s_fable\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schleicher's fable</a>.</sub> </p>\n", "Id":"1728", "ParentId":"786", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "CreationDate":"2012-03-31T01:05:58.057", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-03T15:13:39.477", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-03T15:13:39.477", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
