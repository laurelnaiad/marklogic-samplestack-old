{"Body":"<p>Douglas Hofstadter's <em><a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/purity.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Person Paper on Purity in Language</a></em> is not exactly a \"study\", but I consider it a must-read. It is a satire on racism and sexism in language. I'll let Hofstadter himself summarize it for you.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps this piece shocks you. It is meant to. The entire point of it is to use something that we find shocking as leverage to illustrate the fact that something that we usually close our eyes to is also very shocking. The most effective way I know to do so is to develop an extended analogy with something known as shocking and reprehensible. Racism is that thing, in this case. I am happy with this piece, despite-but also because of-its shock value. I think it makes its point better than any factual article could. As a friend of mine said, \"It makes you so uncomfortable that you can't ignore it.\" I admit that rereading it makes even me, the author, uncomfortable!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Speaking for myself, the piece did not make me uncomfortable in any way... I just found it very very amusing.</p>\n", "Id":"1067", "ParentId":"1052", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2011-11-24T13:57:04.770", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-25T13:20:01.480", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-25T13:20:01.480", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
