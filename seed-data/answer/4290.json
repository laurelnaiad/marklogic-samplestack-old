{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I don't know of any standard models but <em>size</em>, <em>source(s)</em>, <em>quality</em>, <em>fitness for purpose</em>, <em>language(s)</em> and <em>copyright vettedness/copyright restrictions</em> seems like relevant factors. Big size (a copy of the internet) isn't necessarily an asset if what the buyer needs is a domain-specific high quality corpus. There are many corpora already for English, fewer for other languages, but fewer are studying other languages so the market is smaller and they can pay less. </p>\n\n<p>Corpora with too strict licensing can be worthless because you can't use the data for what you need to use it for or there are restrictions on publishing methods etc. As to vettedness: not good to have to scrap research because the seller didn't have the right to sell the raw data in the first place... There was a lot of copyright angst when I dipped my toes into corpus linguistics years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Advice: Be a salesman, pose as a buyer to figure out what the competition is doing :)</p>\n", "Id":"4290", "ParentId":"4288", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:00.630", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:00.630", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
