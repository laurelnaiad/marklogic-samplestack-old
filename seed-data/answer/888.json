{"Body":"<p>I'm not sure if this deserves to be an answer in its own right or if it should just be a comment, because I don't think it's exactly what you're looking for. It involves aspect marking instead of tense marking...</p>\n\n<p>Japanese uses the constructions <em>-te-iku</em> and <em>-te-kuru</em> as aspect markers on verbs. When used as verbs in their own right, <em>iku</em> and <em>kuru</em> express 'go' and 'come', respectively. When used in combination with other verbs (with a verb \"linker\" -<em>te</em>-), they can either retain their original meanings in tandem with the other verb or serve a purely grammatical function. In the latter case, <em>-te-iku</em> expresses a kind of continuation of an action or a state from now on, while <em>-te-kuru</em> expresses actions or states that have been continuous until now. The following examples were taken from <a href=\"http://homepage3.nifty.com/i-yasu/Lesson-e32.htm\">this online Japanese tutorial,</a> one of many informative lessons on a website called \"Yasuko's Nihongo House\"!  (Note that <em>kita</em> is the past tense of <em>kuru</em>.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kanojo wa (korekara mo) onnade hitotsu de kodomo o <em>sodatete iku</em>.<br>\n     'She will (continue to) bring up her child by herself (from now on).' </p>\n  \n  <p>Samuku <em>natte iku</em>.<br>\n     'It will get cold.' </p>\n  \n  <p>Kanojo wa (ima made) onnade hitotsu de kodomo o <em>sodatete kita</em>.<br>\n     'She has brought up her child by herself (until now).' </p>\n  \n  <p>Atsuku <em>natte kita</em>.<br>\n     'It is getting hot.' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have seen these markers glossed simply as -IKU and -KURU in syntax and semantics examples, but Matsuo Soga calls this aspect <em>ingressive aspect</em> in his book <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=-02o0sSJO68C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=ingressive+aspect+japanese&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LcymTsrjCerL0QH8opmeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ingressive%20aspect%20japanese&amp;f=false\"><em>Tense and aspect in modern colloquial Japanese</em></a>.</p>\n", "Id":"888", "ParentId":"886", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "CreationDate":"2011-10-25T00:59:06.097", "OwnerUserId":"385", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-25T14:47:16.453", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
