I'm starting to think that something like a phontactic rule set is only \"complete\" or \"comprehensive\" insofar as the level of detail desired. Like how IPA transcriptions can be as narrow as needed, a phonology needs only to be as detailed as the application demands. I found this book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0199545839\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Phonology of Japanese</a> which claims to be \"the fullest account of Japanese phonology ever published\" all in 320 pages. I ordered the book just yesterday so we'll see. If I wanted a complete guide to American English, however, then I would just get a bunch of books on the subject of \"English phonetics and phonology\" and compile one myself. It may not, after all, be very large.</p>\n", "Id":"2215", "ParentId":"2209", "CreationDate":"2012-07-06T00:46:32.793", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1162", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-06T00:46:32.793", "CommentCount":"3"}
