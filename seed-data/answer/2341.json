{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The differences might be visible in a spectrogram. You could do the experiment yourself: record yourself saying /sasas/ /zazaz/ both voiced and whispered and make spectrograms with for instance Praat, and compare. You'll need to increase the size of the  y-axis though, since you're comparing fricatives. If you're comparing other consonants the standard setup should be fine. If you're not comfortable with reading spectrograms you could add the images to your question and let us have a look at it.</p>\n\n<p>A little quick experimentation of my own makes me think the whispered voiced fricatives are more tense than the unvoiced ones: less space between the articulators, and less air pressure. An interesting follow-up question to this though: is whispering language dependent? That is: is a whispered /z/ the same sound acoustically speaking in, say, French and English?</p>\n", "Id":"2341", "ParentId":"2340", "CreationDate":"2012-08-03T07:31:37.177", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-03T07:31:37.177", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
