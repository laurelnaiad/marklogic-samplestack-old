{"Body":"<p>I would suggest formulating a narrower question if you want some focused answers :-). It would be useful to first come up with a question you would like to ask about meronymy before getting into the nitty-gritty of designing a questionnaire (incidentally, using dictionary entries as empirical evidence for a lexical semantics paper strikes me as deeply odd).</p>\n\n<p>You could, for example, ask questions about the taxonomy of meronymic relations (see, e.g., this paper in CogSci: <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1104_2/pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1104_2/pdf</a> ) - to what extent is the 'part of' semantic relation primitive? We can say that a leaf is part of a tree, and a ship is part of a fleet - but do these express the same primitive semantic relation? </p>\n\n<p>(Just to clarify, i'm not suggesting you ask these questions in your questionnaire, but i'm suggesting a possible over-arching research question to guide your questionnaire construction)</p>\n", "Id":"4132", "ParentId":"4129", "LastEditorUserId":"2328", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T15:38:59.413", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-07T15:48:40.477", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
