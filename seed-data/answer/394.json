{"Body":"<p>From what I understood of the model proposed by Hanson &amp; Stevens 2000, variation in stop VOT by place of articulation is a consequence of the cross-sectional area formed by articulators. There is a plateau in area before vowel onset during which frication occurs. This plateau duration is proportional to anterior-posterior length of the contact region (longer for velars, shorter for labials), and as a result VOT varies by place.
