I.e., the \"mental lexicon\" entry for <em>durar</em> would specify it as being associated with imperfect aspect. The situation in Russian is far more developed than that, in that iirc every single verb has a perfect variant and an imperfect variant, and that systematically one has a prefix and the other does not. That would be <em>grammaticalization</em> because it really becomes a system, not just the idiosyncratic information of a lexical item. (Another important difference is that the Russian aspect distinction is maintained across tenses, i.e. reflected also in the present tense and even in the infinitive, which is again quite different from the Spanish case.)</p>\n\n<p>But as Dan Velleman noted, the Spanish cases appears to (still) be only a tendency, and neither a reflection of lexicalization nor grammaticalization. Still, very interesting data!</p>\n", "Id":"1821", "ParentId":"1663", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T10:11:19.230", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"941", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-19T10:11:19.230", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"9", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.didyoulearnanything.net", "Location":"Germany", "Id":"941", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"522746", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"317", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T09:51:50.690", "DisplayName":"michaelsappir", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-14T14:20:51.253", "Age":"26"}}
