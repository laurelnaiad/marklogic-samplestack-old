{"Body":"<p>The typical linguistic response is that much like Chomsky's famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Colourless green ideas sleep furiously\"</a>, the liar sentence is well-formed but meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>If you insist on evaluating the truth value of the sentence, and posit it is not meaningless in a simple way like \"The present King of France is bald\" (we can't evaluate the truth-value of this sentence since we are referring to something that doesn't exist) but saying that \"This sentence\" is a proper self-reference (note that in formal systems, saying 'this sentence' or a similar reference is much more involved) then the alternative way out for the linguist is to say that language is simply <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liar-paradox/#IncVie\" rel=\"nofollow\">inconsistent</a> and the sentence is both true and false.</p>\n", "Id":"4566", "ParentId":"4556", "LastEditorUserId":"33", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T19:46:48.070", "OwnerUserId":"33", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-02T16:06:11.187", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"125", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akazna/", "Id":"33", "AccountId":"459207", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:58:42.087", "AboutMe":"<p>From the School of Computer Science and Department of Psychology at McGill University, I marvel at the world through algorithmic lenses.
