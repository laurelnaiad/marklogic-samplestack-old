However I've thought about this myself because I use qualifiers a lot in the same manner you do. Your friend's theory is probably the most common, but I think it's completely wrong. Example: I don't have any sense of social hierarchy. I talk to my 3-year old sister the same way I talk to any adult, including the profuse panoplies of \"I think\" and \"I dunno.\"</p>\n\n<p>I think what those hedge words mean is <em>precision</em>. In particular, linguistic precision with respect to the environment. You say \"I think\" because you're expressing something about the real world. In that real world, you aren't 100% sure about that something, so it would be a misrepresentation of reality to imply that you are.</p>\n\n<p>So I think \"I think\" implies both precision and a particular respect/perspective of the world, which may be two sides of the same coin.</p>\n", "Id":"2608", "ParentId":"2601", "CreationDate":"2012-09-23T17:54:13.517", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1123", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-23T17:54:13.517", "CommentCount":"2"}
