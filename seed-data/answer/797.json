{"Body":"<p>One example of a non-argument <em>of</em>-phrase would be <em>of</em>-possessives.  (Possessors are by definition not arguments.)  The best way to make sure that an <em>of</em> phrase is really a possessive is to mark it (redundantly) with <em>'s</em>:</p>\n\n<pre>\n(1) That dog of John's is really vicious.\n</pre>\n\n<p>It is less than clear, syntactically/semantically speaking, what is going on here (Why the double-marking of possessive?  Is there some kind of partitivity?  What, if any, is the difference in meaning between the above and \"John's dog\"?) â€“ but it is clear that this is a non-argument <em>of</em>-phrase.</p>\n", "Id":"797", "ParentId":"784", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "CreationDate":"2011-10-13T16:15:54.127", "OwnerUserId":"46", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-13T16:23:23.320", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
