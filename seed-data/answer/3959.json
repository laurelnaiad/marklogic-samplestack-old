{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>One good attempt at a language like this is Dutton Speedwords, which was elaborated under a principle known as Zipf's law, namely, that most common words are the shortest. One language that preceded Esperanto was Volap√ºk, which made words unrecognizable and difficult to connect to words in other languages. In the free marketplace of ideas, Esperanto rose to the top of the IAL heap even without adhering to Zipf's law, so those who have learned it have not found that lack of conciseness to be disadvantageous. If conciseness were a necessity for the advancement of a language, then you would see greater popularity of Solresol, whose alphabetic components are the seven basic tones of the music scale, or Toki Pona, the product of a transgendered Canadian teenager dabbling in Eastern religions. </p>\n", "Id":"3959", "ParentId":"3957", "CreationDate":"2013-07-03T10:26:15.333", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2218", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-03T10:26:15.333", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2218", "AccountId":"3000509", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"51", "CreationDate":"2013-07-03T10:26:15.333", "DisplayName":"Gael Rumain", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-03T15:48:00.817"}}
