Only reforms in Chinese is a counter-example. The impetus of changes derives of the cultural changes in the communities. Historical American English and Brazilian Portugues changed faster. One language with many more or less isolated communities (historic Greek), isolated Portuguese in Portugal and Brasil. Small Dutch/Flanders may have easier reforms.</p>\n\n<p>Regulation like revisions, and cross-community standardisation, are conservative (though still receive much opposition). Take the reform of German where some occurrences of <code>ÃŸ</code> (but not all) were replaced by <code>ss</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Regulation authorities are seldom speeding things up to a larger degree. In general they start to allow new orthography and finally make some new spelling the standard. They also cannot really hinder new cultural terms.</p>\n\n<p>The dictionary though intending to be non-regulative, in fact <em>is</em> regulative. As people tend to follow spelling and word choice as provided in the dictionaries.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Conclusion:</em></strong> The mosquito steering the elephant. Though language regulation is linguistically important, its controlling function (negative or positive) depends on other factors, like the Chinese in the past wanting to do a huge simplification.</p>\n", "Id":"5949", "ParentId":"3324", "CreationDate":"2013-11-20T17:13:04.490", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1611", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-20T17:13:04.490", "CommentCount":"2"}
