{"Body":"<p>The short answer is: no. This sequence of letters comes from various roots, and it even cuts right through some of them, like <em>-ped-</em> below. It is not a suffix, but merely a sequence of letters. What those words do have in common etymologically is <em>-t-ion</em>, which is in all cases a combination of the same two suffixes <em>-t-</em> and <em>-ion-</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>ex-ped-i-t-ion</strong>, it comes from Latin <em>pes,</em> stem <em>ped-</em>, meaning \"foot\". The original sense of the verb <em>ex-ped-i-o</em> was \"to get the foot out of [a snare]\" (<em>-i-</em> is here a suffix that can turn a noun into a verb). Hence it came to connote a certain sense of (increased) movement or speed. It was already used with various similar connotations in Latin: <em>expedio</em> also meant roughly \"to expedit\".</p>\n\n<p>The suffix <em>-t-</em> is used to form a past participle out of a verbal stem.</p>\n\n<p>The suffix <em>-io(n-)</em> is generally added to the stem of a past participle (here <em>ex-ped-i-t-</em>) to form a noun of action or result: the act of expediting, or the result of expediting.</p>\n\n<p>In your other examples, <em>-di-t-ion</em> comes from the Latin verb <em>do,</em> verbal stem <em>da-</em>, past participle <em>da-t-us/-di-t-us</em>, participial stem <em>da-t-/-di-t-</em>, meaning \"give\". In compound words, <em>do</em> also means simply \"put\" or \"set\". </p>\n\n<p>In an <strong>e-di-t-ion</strong>, you give out your book to the public (Dutch <em>uit-geven</em>, \"to give out, to publish\"): Latin <em>e(x)</em> = \"out\". </p>\n\n<p>In <strong>ex-tra-di-t-ion</strong>, you give someone <em>out</em> from your own group to the other side/party: from <em>ex-tra</em> = \"on the outside\", which is short for <em>extra parte</em>, \"on the out-side\", from the adjective <em>ex-ter</em> = \"out\", stem <em>ex-tr-</em>, from <em>ex</em> and the adjectival suffix <em>-ter/-tr-</em>). </p>\n\n<p>In <strong>ad-di-t-ion</strong>, you give or place a certain something <em>next to</em> something else, as in adding something to a sum: from <em>ad</em> = \"to, at\".</p>\n\n<p>But there are other words where it comes from yet other stems:</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>sed-i-t-ion</strong>, it comes from <em>se(d)-</em> = \"apart, away\", plus <em>eo</em> = \"to go\", present stem <em>e-/i-</em>, plus the participial suffix <em>-t-</em>: \"a going away (from a group), a rebellion\".</p>\n\n<p>Related question: <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/40390/word-formation-with-the-nominal-suffix-tion-when-and-why-do-we-insert-an-a\">Word formation with the nominal suffix -tion: when and why do we insert an “a”?</a></p>\n", "Id":"2788", "ParentId":"2786", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2012-11-02T20:21:37.067", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-08T06:26:01.813", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-08T06:26:01.813", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"12", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
