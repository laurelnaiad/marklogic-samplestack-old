{"Body":"<p>Campbell (2004: 36) gives the OE form of 'thunder' as <strong>þunrian</strong> (though whether this OE form or the other is considered shouldn't affect the explanation), and indicates the addition of the stop consonant to be an example of excrescence, along with <strong>þy:mel</strong> > <em>thimble</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Note that in both examples the excrescent stop follows a nasal consonant and precedes an oral sonorant. The transition from a nasal consonant to an oral sonorant requires a velum-raising gesture and an obstruction-releasing gesture to happen more or less at the same time. The production of a voiced stop following a nasal consonant happens naturally and spontaneously if the obstruction-releasing gesture lags the velum-lowering gesture just a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be of anecdotal interest to note that in a number of languages (e.g., Korean, some Amazonian languages) what are described as nasal consonants may be pronounced as either nasals, voiced stops or prenasalized voiced stops.</p>\n\n<p>Campbell, L.
