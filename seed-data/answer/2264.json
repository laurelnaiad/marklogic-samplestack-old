{"Body":"<p>End-rhyming is actually not even an originally English mechanism! Old English poems didn't rhyme like we do now. Instead, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_verse\" rel=\"nofollow\">alliterative verse</a> was widely found in the early Germanic languages. Alliterative verse uses head-rhymes (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliteration\" rel=\"nofollow\">alliteration</a>) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony\" rel=\"nofollow\">stress-timing</a>, instead of modern end-rhymes and syllable-timing. </p>\n\n<p>The modern English rhyming scheme was borrowed from the Classical and Romance traditions. </p>\n\n<p>As you say, end-rhymes are more natural to languages that make wide use of suffixal inflections (like most Romance languages and Latin/Greek). Syllable timing is more natural to many of these languages, too, since the interval between syllabic nuclei is approximately equal. Vowel quantity also played an important role in Latin and Greek meter. Stress-timing on the other hand, where the interval between <em>stressed</em> syllables is approximately equal, is more natural to languages like English and Portuguese that have notable vowel-reduction processes. And since English has nearly no suffixal inflections, end-rhymes are less common though, of course, still plentiful in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/59989/16191\"><strong>my answer to a similar question on English.SE</strong></a> for a fuller explanation of the verse form.</p>\n", "Id":"2264", "ParentId":"2260", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "CreationDate":"2012-07-17T15:48:00.300", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-17T16:57:29.640", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-17T16:57:29.640", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
