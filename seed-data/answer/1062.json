This is is notably the case in the Germanic languages, with the divergent distribution of the groups represented by NE <em>sea</em> and NHG <em>meer</em>.\" Any typos are mine, very small and unclear type in my copy of the book...</p>\n\n<p>Nobody got it \"wrong\", and it is safe to assume that every word has its own story and its own path through time.
