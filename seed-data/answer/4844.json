Says Whitney in his Sanskrit Grammar (pp. 58-9):</p>\n\n<p>\"Before an initial sibilant -- รง, แนฃ, s -- s is either assimilated, becoming the same sibilant, or it is changed into visarga. The native grammarians are in some measure at variance as to which of these changes should be made, and in part they allow either at pleasure. The usage of the manuscripts is also discordant; the conversion to visarga is the prevalent practice, though the sibilant is also not infrequently found written, especially in South-Indian manuscripts. European editors generally write visarga.\"</p>\n", "Id":"4844", "ParentId":"4842", "CreationDate":"2013-11-03T21:48:20.003", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-03T21:48:20.003", "CommentCount":"2"}
