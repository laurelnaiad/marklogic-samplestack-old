I've actually read a few texts written by nonconformists that use kana and spaces instead of kana and kanji. Meanings are contextually obvious frequently enough that it's not really a problem most of the time (and I can imagine that if the switch was made, those problem words would be replaced with more distinct ones fairly quickly).\nIt's also true that Korean has more potential readings for hanja than Japanese has for kanji (it allows syllable-final consonants, for one thing), but I'm not sure how much this affects anything.</p>\n", "Id":"3832", "ParentId":"3831", "CreationDate":"2013-06-09T00:48:56.193", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-09T00:48:56.193", "CommentCount":"6"}
