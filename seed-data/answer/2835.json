{"Body":"<p>Andrew Sihler (Sihler 1995) argues that Greek is \"the only centum language [...] attesting a contrast between reflexes of ḱw and *kʷ\". In Greek \"two distinct sounds *ḱw give a double consonant medially, while the unitary *kʷ gives a single consonant\" (p. 159). For example,</p>\n\n<p><strong>PIE *ḱw > Greek ππ</strong>, e.g. Greek ἵππος, Latin equus, equos, Myc. iqo</p>\n\n<p><strong>PIE *kʷ > Greek π</strong>, e.g. Greek ἕπομαι, Lat. sequitur</p>\n\n<p>He also acknowledges the fact that this argumentation is based on one word only, Greek ἵππος, \"whose peculiarities <strong>do not inspire confidence</strong>\" (p. 160) [emphasis mine - Alex B.].</p>\n\n<p>As for the contrast PIE *kw - PIE *kʷ, I think the evidence also comes from Greek (and Mycenaean): e.g. the so called boukolos rule states that \"a labiovelar lost its labial element when adjacent to the vowel *u\" (Fortson 2010: 70). For example,</p>\n\n<p>Greek βουκόλος 'cowherd' (PIE *gʷoukʷolos > PIE *gʷoukolos), but αἰπόλος 'goatherd' (PIE*aikʷolos).</p>\n\n<p><strong>To conclude:</strong> PIE was not a monolithic, 'timeless' language that never changed. There is good reason to believe that there were different stages in its development, too.</p>\n", "Id":"2835", "ParentId":"2832", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2012-11-13T00:56:49.297", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-13T16:27:47.167", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-13T16:27:47.167", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"11", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
