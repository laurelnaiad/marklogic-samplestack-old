{"Body":"<p>Someone who's done a fair amount of work on studying the applicability of evolutionary metaphors (with greater or lesser degrees of abstraction) is <a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~wedel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrew Wedel</a> (who has the additional benefit of PhDs in both biology and linguistics). In particular, he wrote \"<em><a href=\"http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~wedel/publications/PDF/WedelExEvLangChange.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exemplar models, evolution and language change</a>\"</em> that explicitly addresses (i) pruning of lines of inheritance, (ii) blending inheritance, and (iii) natural selection as pathways of evolutionary language change.</p>\n\n<p>He has several other papers along with this one that discuss evolutionary dynamics in language change and acquisition, most of which deal with fairly low-level sound change, and many of which involve simulation/modelling couched in a particular non-generative  framework (exemplar/memory-based). Following the links on his pubs page and the references therein should net you much.</p>\n", "Id":"961", "ParentId":"392", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2011-11-06T02:34:35.733", "OwnerUserId":"485", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-05T15:10:06.357", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
