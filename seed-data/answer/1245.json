If I have to talk about X in English, I would be concerned about preserving the precise meaning together with all surrounding context so that no information is lost to the audience. When there's an exact match (occasionally it's a loanword from French or another language which is not in the dictionary) I do this much more easily. Alternatively, if German and French have a single word for X, I might suspect English has one, too, which I don't know. English is a very malleable language and I'm a bit hesitant to coin new phrases if established ones already exist.</p>\n", "Id":"1245", "ParentId":"1223", "CreationDate":"2012-01-09T14:08:25.020", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"655", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-09T14:08:25.020", "CommentCount":"2"}
