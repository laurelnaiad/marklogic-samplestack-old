{"Body":"<p>I disagree with hippietrail's answer as I have not seen any dictionaries which describe this type of relationship as antonymy. For example: <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/father#related-to-more\" rel=\"nofollow\">father</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnrtl.fr/antonymie/p%C3%A8re\" rel=\"nofollow\">père</a>. In Merriam-webster we have <strong><em>descendant</em></strong> as antonym, and in TLFi <strong><em>enfant</em></strong>.  As such, I don't think considering these types of words as antonyms is a common point of view.</p>\n\n<p>In Semantics (1977, pp. 279—280), John Lyons calls this relationship <a href=\"http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=jQA6wVLCINUC&amp;q=converseness#v=snippet&amp;q=converseness&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>converseness</em></a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To be distinguished from antonymy and complementarity is\n  converseness*, exemplified by pairs like 'husband' : 'wife' (which may\n  be regarded as two-place predicates). The sentence 'X is the husband\n  of Y' express a proposition whose converse is expressed by 'X is the\n  wife of Y' (cf. 6.3).</p>\n  \n  <p>Converse relations between lexemes which may be used as two-place\n  predicative expressions are especially common in areas of the\n  vocabulary having to do with reciprocal social roles\n  ('doctor' : 'patient', 'master'/'mistress' : 'servant') and kinship\n  relations ('father' : 'mother','son' : 'daughter' etc.) &lt;...></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in my opinion it's not applicable for lion/lioness, tiger/tigress so I don't know how to call this kind of relationship.</p>\n", "Id":"4284", "ParentId":"4258", "LastEditorUserId":"1055", "CreationDate":"2013-08-27T19:17:58.150", "OwnerUserId":"2410", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-28T07:17:07.067", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"102", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Seoul, South Korea", "Id":"1055", "DownVotes":"9", "AccountId":"1453460", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"1947", "CreationDate":"2012-05-29T05:50:57.073", "DisplayName":"acattle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:59:41.983", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently studying for an MA in Computational Linguistics even though my background is not in linguistics.
