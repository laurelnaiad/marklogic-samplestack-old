Instead we typically refer to the noun phrase after the copula as a <em>subject complement</em>. (Subject complements can also be adjective or preposition phrases, incidentally.)</p>\n\n<p>That's the difference between  a copula and a transitive verb: a copula takes a subject and a subject complement, a transitive verb takes a subject and a direct object.</p>\n\n<p>One way to test this is that transitive clauses can be passivised but clauses with a copula cannot.
