{"Body":"<p><em>One thing to remember about English spelling is that for the most part it is \"frozen\", and reflects the Middle English pronunciation. Another thing to remember is that there has never been a standardized spelling for English, and individual judgment, errors, and a variety of dialects have played a large role in how words are spelled. So every question about English spelling has to be considered in light of these two major issues.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Night</strong>, <strong>fight</strong>, and <strong>wight</strong> are all pronounced with a final /-aɪt/ in Modern English. Their &lt; -ght > spelling reflects the Middle English pronunciations, which had a final /-ixt/. (The digraph &lt; gh > in MidEng represented the sounds /x/ or /ç/, which were also variously spelled &lt; h >, &lt; ch >, &lt; ȝ >.) </p>\n\n<p>The reason the three words are spelled similarly in Modern English is that they rhymed in Middle English. The reason they rhymed in Middle English despite differing etymologies is that they underwent regular predictable phonological mergers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In Proto-Germanic these words were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>nɑxt</strong>-s 'night <em>n.</em>' &lt; PIE <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P1373.html\">*nokʷts</a></li>\n<li><strong>wiht</strong>-iz 'creature, person, thing <em>n.</em>' &lt; PIE <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P2130.html\">*wekti-</a></li>\n<li><strong>fex-t</strong> ɑn 'to comb wool, to struggle <em>v.</em>' &lt; PIE <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P1469.html\">*pek-</a>. The /t/ came from the personal suffix on the verb.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In Old English the three rhymes were not yet homophones. The /a/ in the <strong>night</strong> etymon had raised to /i/ under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_umlaut#Palatal_umlaut\">palatal umlaut</a>, causing it to rhyme with <strong>wight</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>niht</strong> /niht/ [niçt] 'night'</li>\n<li><strong>wiht</strong> /wiht/ [wiçt] 'wight' </li>\n<li>but <strong>feoht</strong> /feoht/ [feoxt] 'fight <em>n.</em>' </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>By Middle English the rhymes were all homophonous in /-iːht/. This was due to the effects of raising on the sequence /eoh/ to /ih/ in a series of steps: /eoh/ -> /øːh/ -> /eːh/ -> /iːh/; thus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>niht</strong> -> <strong>night</strong> /niːht/</li>\n<li><strong>wiht</strong> -> <strong>wight</strong> /wiːht/</li>\n<li>and <strong>feoht</strong> -> <strong>fight</strong> /fiːht/</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In the <a href=\"http://eweb.furman.edu/~mmenzer/gvs/what.htm\">English Great Vowel Shift</a>, Middle English /iː/ diphthongized to [ɪi], then became [əɪ], and finally Modern English [aɪ]. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_fricatives_and_affricates#Taut.E2.80.93taught_merger\">Non-initial /h/ was lost</a>. This led to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>night</strong> /naɪt/</li>\n<li><strong>wight</strong> /waɪt/</li>\n<li><strong>fight</strong> /faɪt/</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>QED</p>\n", "Id":"2767", "ParentId":"2765", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "CreationDate":"2012-10-29T00:32:28.940", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-29T00:40:33.240", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-29T00:40:33.240", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
