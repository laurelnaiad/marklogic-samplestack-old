{"Body":"<p>Which paradigm is the more accurate or more adequate can not be answered in general. It may depend on what should be achieved since there are different advantages and disadvantages to both systems.</p>\n\n<p>Many commercial approaches use a so called hybrid system which means that there is both a statistic and a rule-based component (or even an example-based component).</p>\n\n<p>There are some advantages to the statistical approach, e.g. coping better with \"irregularities\" or better coverage of phrasemes, and some advantages to the rule-based approach, e.g. the abilitiy of syntactic validation. In hybrid systems like the Pangloss or the Verbmobil-system both components are parallel or in order with the goal to adjust both advantages for a better product.</p>\n", "Id":"581", "ParentId":"350", "LastEditorUserId":"119", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T11:27:33.677", "OwnerUserId":"74", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-28T18:48:08.550", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-28T18:48:08.550", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/beyeran", "Location":"Germany", "Id":"74", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"236916", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"131", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:15:35.837", "DisplayName":"beyeran", "LastAccessDate":"2012-06-26T15:07:09.240", "Age":"27"}}
