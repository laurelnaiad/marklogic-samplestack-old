{"OwnerDisplayName":"Damkerng T.", "comments":[], "Body":"<p>I am not a linguist, but perhaps I could share some useful insight as someone who works in the field of human language technology (HLT), specifically making the machine to understand human languages.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience, we don't use the prescriptive grammar (the one that dictates good composition and style) when we think; the same applies to speaking, which is mainly spontaneous. The prescriptive grammar comes into play when we write, or give a formal public speech, where we have enough time to reflect our thoughts and to rephrase our words appropriately.</p>\n\n<p>The natural grammar in our brains is very flexible, and can vary from one person to another, even within the same dialect. In my opinion, this natural grammar is developed in our brains in our childhood and finally imprinted as we grown up. It is also possible that we can have more than one set of such a natural grammar, if we grown up in a multi-cultural environment. And pretty much like swimming, once the grammar, no matter how many languages in total, has been imprinted to your brain, you will never forget it.</p>\n\n<p>I myself was raised in the south of Thailand until I was five, and I never forget how to say the southern dialect. But similar to you, I have to use a little effort to speak in that dialect, or it might just come out the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is useful.</p>\n", "Id":"2239", "ParentId":"2238", "CreationDate":"2012-07-11T02:17:24.760", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1482", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-11T02:17:24.760", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1482", "AccountId":"850963", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"191", "CreationDate":"2012-11-10T13:37:06.807", "DisplayName":"Damkerng T.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T17:53:11.193"}}
