In standard orthography they would be written as <em>give me</em> etc., but we all know most people pronounce them as these fused forms. So the real question is when these will become established orthography, and my suspicion is that it will never happen given how strongly English spelling resists reform despite its clearly showing age.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if I may add a claim that I cannot substantiate, I thought I read somewhere that PIE had only two genders (animate and inanimate). If this is indeed the case, the distinction between masculine and feminine was gained at some point. I think it was said that the feminine evolved out of the plural of inanimates; I don’t know exactly how that’s supposed to work, but it would explain why neuter nominative plural and feminine nominative singular tend to have the same ending, <em>-a</em>, in many IE languages.</p>\n", "Id":"134", "ParentId":"127", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T18:56:18.590", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"50", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T18:56:18.590", "CommentCount":"3"}
