As with Lojban it has the problem that it forces the human to change behavior by being much more precise and specific than normal.

Because of this I don't see how using a programming language that was also a human language would gain us anything: No matter the syntax of the programming language, in order for the computer to be able to do something predictable with it, the human coder would still have to be a pedantic perfectionist crossing all t's and dotting all i's.</p>\n\n<p>Humans do fuzzy matching and inference very well, computers not so much.</p>\n", "Id":"1702", "ParentId":"1697", "CreationDate":"2012-03-25T14:43:20.820", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-25T14:43:20.820", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
