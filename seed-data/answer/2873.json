{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The Turkish language has two simple 2nd person pronouns: \"sen\" and \"siz\". \"Sen\" is the 2nd person singular pronoun which is used to address a single person and connotes a speaker's familiarity, friendship, or consanguinity with the person being addressed. \"Sen\" is sometimes also used by the speaker if he/she is addressing someone much younger than themselves (e.g., a child) or someone of an inferior position or rank (e.g., in academia or on a job). \"Siz\" is the 2nd person plural pronoun and is used to address more than one person (irrespective of their relationship to the speaker) or a single person with whom the speaker is not very familiar with or closely related to. It's also used when addressing someone of a superior rank, position, or age. \"Siz\" is also typically used to express the speaker's politeness.</p>\n", "Id":"2873", "ParentId":"2445", "CreationDate":"2012-11-21T02:45:36.980", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1513", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-21T02:45:36.980", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1513", "AccountId":"2064751", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"95", "CreationDate":"2012-11-21T01:19:02.507", "DisplayName":"Rajan S.", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-30T10:25:28.210"}}
