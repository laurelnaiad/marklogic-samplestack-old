Plus it doesn't really make sense. If you wanna get rid of word-initial *<em>w-</em> by reconstructing it as *<em>we-</em>, you'll notice that *<em>w-</em> is still initial. So now you need to reconstruct *<em>we-</em> as *<em>wee-</em>, *<em>wee-</em> as *<em>weee-</em> etc. ad infinitum.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, we don't reconstruct *<em>w-</em> as *<em>we-</em> and *<em>ū</em> as *<em>ew</em> because there are lots and lots of examples of PIE *<em>we-</em> and *<em>ew</em> that didn't become *<em>w-</em> and *<em>ū</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"2881", "ParentId":"2859", "CreationDate":"2012-11-22T20:19:00.713", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"105", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-22T20:19:00.713", "CommentCount":"1"}
