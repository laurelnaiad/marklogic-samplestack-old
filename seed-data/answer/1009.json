{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Insofar as the status of head directionality as a binary parameter is considered to be an empirical hypothesis, it is false as an absolute universal. So you are not missing anything. Uniform head directionality, however, is a bidirectional statistical universal. VO word order is highly predictive of prepositions, and prepositions are highly predictive of VO word order. And vice versa. For data on the correlations between verb-object and noun-adposition word orders in 1142 languages, see <a href=\"http://wals.info/chapter/95\">Dryer 2011</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, you would rather not reject the parametric head directionality hypothesis, you can claim that something else is going on in the languages which fail to adhere to the word order correlations. <a href=\"http://rci.rutgers.edu/~mabaker/Amharic-Ps-as-case-paper-posted.pdf\">Baker and Kramer 2011</a>, for example, argue that prepositions in Amharic (which has OV word order) are not really prepositions, but case markers. But the more you indulge in the \"it's not really a post/preposition\" gambit, the more strict head directionality turns into an analytical principle rather than a testable hypothesis.</p>\n", "Id":"1009", "ParentId":"1007", "CreationDate":"2011-11-11T00:29:24.750", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-11T00:29:24.750", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
