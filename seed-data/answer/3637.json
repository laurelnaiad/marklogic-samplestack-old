{"Body":"<p>In general, vowel backness (as well as all the other attributes) is not the property of a certain language. It's because of the nature of the human vocal tract.</p>\n\n<p>This way, each vowel sound produced has a certain backness (as well as the other features).</p>\n\n<p>However, languages use different <em>mappings</em> of phones to phonemes. In other words, each point on a vowel diagram is not a point, but rather an area. Everything that falls into that area is mapped to a certain phoneme.<br>\nThere are plenty of languages that do not distinct backness (on IPA vowel diagram, it looks like an area occupying the whole width of the diagram).</p>\n\n<p>For example:<br>\nPolish \"m<b>y</b>sz\" (mouse) <code>[mɘ̟ʂ]</code>. Different speakers may actually say <code>[mɪʂ]</code> or <code>[mʊʂ]</code>, but a listener would <em>map</em> it to an existing phoneme, <code>ɘ̟</code>.<br>\nGerman \"bitt<b>e</b>\" (please) <code>[ˈbɪ-tə]</code><br>\nGreek \"ακακί<b>α</b>\" (acacia) <code>[ɐ-kɐ-ˈci.-ɐ]</code>  </p>\n\n<p>There is yet another consideration. Although some languages lack <em>cardinal</em> central vowels, those vowel appear <em>in a spoken language</em> due to various phonetic phenomenons (of course, individual for every language). For instance, it's a common effect of centralization/reduction of unstressed vowels in Russian:</p>\n\n<p>\"молоко\" (milk) <code>[mə-ɫʌ-'kɔ]</code><br>\nNote that this word contains three \"o\", the last one in stressed, and two unstressed ones are reduced in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>\"этот\" (this) <code>[ˈɛ-tət]</code><br>\nNote that <code>ɛ</code> (front mid) in this word, regardless of stress, is often pronounced <code>ɜ</code> (central mid).</p>\n", "Id":"3637", "ParentId":"3636", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-05-03T23:38:38.897", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-06T12:02:07.607", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-06T12:02:07.607", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
