Given that it is thought that the majority of the world's languages make use of some kind of tonal contrast in their phonology, that tone seems to be a feature likely to be conserved diachronically, and that tonogenesis seems to happen fairly readily, we shouldn't expect there to be many examples of the loss of tone.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/aalled/Univ_ete/3LCourseMaterial/African%20%28Cushitic%29%20topics%20-%20M.%20Mous/Downing.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Downing (2004)</a> proto-Bantu is reconstructed as having had two tones. While most present-day Bantu languages have tonal contrasts a few have lost them, retaining only a stress system, eg Chimwi:ni, Kituba, Nyakyusa and Swahili.</p>\n\n<p>It has been argued by Indo-Europeanist scholars (including <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/piep15.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christian Lehmann</a>) that an early stage of proto-Indo-European had a pitch-accent system which was lost in most daughter branches. It was preserved into Ancient Greek (although lost in Modern Greek) and continues in present-day Lithuanian and some Slavic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_accent\" rel=\"nofollow\">languages</a>. The tone systems found in some North Germanic languages are thought to be relatively recent innovations.</p>\n", "Id":"2543", "ParentId":"2532", "CreationDate":"2012-09-08T12:49:13.283", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-08T12:49:13.283", "CommentCount":"2"}
