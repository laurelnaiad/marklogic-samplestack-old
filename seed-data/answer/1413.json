{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This problem has been in no way settled in historical linguistics and has caused much debate. However, there is some consensus that in the case of language contact there are usually some <strong>barriers to diffusion</strong>, such as geographical, social, and typological. Alan Dench (Dench 2006) argues that \"where languages spring from a common source, their split must be seen as the eventual result of an accumulation of <strong>blocked diffusions</strong> - waves breaking against geographical and, most importantly, social barriers\" (p. 113). Have a look at a nice collection of papers on this topic in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=sPGe7aBSkpkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Areal diffusion and genetic inheritance: Problems in comparative linguistics</a> , ed.
