{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Here are two such arguments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cinque separates epistemic and \"root\" (= circumstantial and deontic) modality, based on the positioning of certain adverbs, which he argues are associated with functional heads.

Modal semantics are understood (especially by Kratzer, one of the architects of this theory) in terms of possible worlds.  It is possible to understand tense also via possible worlds, but this is orthogonal to what is going on with the hydrangeas.  Look into some of Kratzer's work on ordering sources to unpack the nuances of the modal interpretations further.  (I can give a reference if you want; I don't have that paper in front of me now and Google is not being helpful.)</p>\n", "Id":"383", "ParentId":"362", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T00:29:01.217", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-22T00:29:01.217", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
