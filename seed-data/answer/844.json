Who knows what criteria for \"fluent\" the native speakers were using (or my professor, for that matter). Maybe \"fluency\" is culturally related to \"adulthood\" in the native speakers mind or something. </p>\n\n<p>Just thought I'd put it out there!</p>\n", "Id":"844", "ParentId":"778", "CreationDate":"2011-10-18T17:41:50.550", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"42", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-18T17:41:50.550", "CommentCount":"1"}
