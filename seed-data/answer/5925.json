{"Body":"<p>If you're trying to gather information on aphasia, you'll have much more luck consulting the literature of Speech/Language Science or Neuropsychology than you will in the Linguistics literature.   Speech/Language Sci departments &amp; Neuropsychologists educate not only the neuropsychologists &amp; speech/language therapists who assess and treat aphasia but also most of the scientists who do aphasia research.  </p>\n\n<p>a.   Examples of relevant journals:   </p>\n\n<p>Advances in Speech-language Pathology</p>\n\n<p>American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology</p>\n\n<p>Canadian Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology</p>\n\n<p>International Journal of Speech Language Pathology</p>\n\n<p>Journal of Medical Speech-Language Pathology</p>\n\n<p>Journal of Speech and Language Pathology, Applied Behavior Analysis</p>\n\n<p>Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research</p>\n\n<p>Language and Speech</p>\n\n<p>Topics in Language Disorders</p>\n\n<p>b.   If you have lots of money, the pricey online \"Aphasiology\" journal may be useful:  <a href=\"http://www.psypress.com/journals/details/0268-7038/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.psypress.com/journals/details/0268-7038/</a></p>\n\n<p>c.   Here's a guide to Aphasia research:  <a href=\"https://www.aphasia.org/?q=content/research-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.aphasia.org/?q=content/research-guide</a></p>\n\n<p>d.   Most hospitals have speech/language therapists on staff, and some are Ph.D.'s in this field.    </p>\n\n<p>e.   Here's a list of books and articles about aphasia at Questia:   <a href=\"http://www.questia.com/library/science-and-technology/health-and-medicine/diseases-and-disorders/aphasia\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.questia.com/library/science-and-technology/health-and-medicine/diseases-and-disorders/aphasia</a>   </p>\n\n<p>f.
