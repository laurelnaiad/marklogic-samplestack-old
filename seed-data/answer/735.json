However, this theory can't explain why \"m\" is dominant than other nasal sounds, why only first-person, and why m-based first-person pronouns tend to co-occur with t-based second-person pronouns. This also can't explain why it's only common in northern Eurasia.</p></li>\n<li><p>They come from the same genealogical origin.
