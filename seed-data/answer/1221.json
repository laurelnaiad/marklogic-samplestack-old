{"Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/SMOG_Readability_Formula_G._Harry_McLaughlin_%281969%29.pdf\">original 1969 SMOG paper</a> is pretty clear that the number is treated as a single unit:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the 30 selected sentences count every word of three or more\n  syllables. Any string of letters or numerals beginning and ending with\n  a space or punctuation mark should be counted if you can distinguish\n  at least three syllables when you read it aloud in context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the single number \" 23,578 \" which begins and ends with a space is indeed polysyllabic when pronounced. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: It depends entirely on which test you choose. Compare Flesch (<a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/32/3/221/\">Flesch R (1948). \"A new readability yardstick\". Journal of Applied Psychology 32: 221–233</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Count as words numbers or letters separated by space... Count the\n  number of syllables in symbols and figures according to the way they\n  are normally read aloud, e.g two for $ (\"dollars\") and four for 1918\n  (\"nineteen-eighteen\"). If a passage contains several or lengthy\n  figures, your estimate will be more accurate if you don't include\n  these figures in your syllable count.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Flesch says to count a number as one word, but gives you the ability to skip big numbers in your statistics.  </p>\n\n<p>But see also Kincaid (<a href=\"http://digitalcollections.lib.ucf.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/IST&amp;CISOPTR=26301&amp;CISOSHOW=26253\">DERIVATION  OF  NEW  READABILITY  FORMULAS  ( AUTOMATED READABILITY  INDEX ,  FOG  COUNT  AND  FLESCH  READING  EASE  FORMULA ) FOR  NAVY  ENLISTED  PERSONNEL</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Recalculated Fog Count: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Fog Count treats all numbers, regardless of size, as easy words. \n  Therefore, <strong>all numbers receive a value of 1</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Recaculated \"Flesch-Kincaid\" readability: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Count as a word any numbers, letters, symbols, groups of letters\n  surrounded by white spaces...For example, <strong>each of the  following count\n  as one word</strong>: couldn't F.O.B. i.e. <strong>32,008</strong>\"</p>\n  \n  <p>With symbols and figures the syllables are known by the way they are\n  normally  pronounced, for example, ¢ (cent) 1 syllable R.F.D. 3\n  syllables <strong>1918 (nineteen eighteen) 4 syllables</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"1221", "ParentId":"1220", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "CreationDate":"2012-01-03T02:19:11.943", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-03T17:19:11.163", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-03T17:19:11.163", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
