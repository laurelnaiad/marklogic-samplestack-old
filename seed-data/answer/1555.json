Sorry mate, the locals have been assimiliated into a more westernized culture and only eats the same stuff you do now. Want to know how the locals used to make the paint of a particular shade of blue that is more long-lasting than anything found in the west? Sorry, the conquerors killed the people who knew how for being witches and cut out the tongues of those who spoke the language. Want to know whether this fungus has been used for medical purposes? No can do, the locals who used the fungus died of cholera in the fifties, etc. ad nauseam.</p>\n\n<p>For science, the loss of information is a tragedy.</p>\n", "Id":"1555", "ParentId":"1549", "CreationDate":"2012-03-03T11:39:41.567", "Score":"14", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-03T11:39:41.567", "CommentCount":"2"}
