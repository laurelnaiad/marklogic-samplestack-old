But despite not being a historical linguist,  I can say re question 1 that where a feature is found in only one language family (if Khoisan is a language family!) and there's no evidence of it in others (apart from borrowing), the default assumption is usually that it was an innovation of the ancestor of that language family. So it makes sense to say that clicks were probably an innovation of proto-Khoisan and therefore pretty recent, at least compared to 'proto-World'. The spread of the Bantu languages was even more recent, so they were able to borrow them. The fact that they were borrowed and have been stable in those languages for some time suggests that they aren't that 'unfit'.</p>\n", "Id":"666", "ParentId":"663", "CreationDate":"2011-10-03T02:45:03.177", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-03T02:45:03.177", "CommentCount":"1"}
