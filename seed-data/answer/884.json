{"Body":"<p>To enlarge on what Cerberus said: your premise is wrong. Different phonemes in a language are by definition different in sound (for  at least some phonological environments). The fact that speakers of some other language may find them similar is a fact about that other language, not about the target language. </p>\n\n<p>I completely agree with Louis Rhys' comment, that a notation which confuses two different phonemes in a language is a particularly bad notation for that language - <em>especially</em> for learning it. (Conventional orthographies for languages sometimes do confuse phonemes in this way, but in these cases materials for learners will often disambiguate them.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: added rider about phonological environment - thanks @Musicallinguist - and not about conventional orthographies.</p>\n", "Id":"884", "ParentId":"882", "LastEditorUserId":"348", "CreationDate":"2011-10-24T11:45:00.137", "OwnerUserId":"348", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-25T10:09:11.197", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"17", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"348", "AccountId":"371222", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-09-29T12:58:58.827", "DisplayName":"Colin Fine", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-02T01:03:55.383"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-25T10:09:11.197", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"17", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"348", "AccountId":"371222", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-09-29T12:58:58.827", "DisplayName":"Colin Fine", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-02T01:03:55.383"}}
