The iconic assumption that\n  such a regular bi-unique correspondence must exist motivates the\n  inclusion under a single heading of the various meanings of a single\n  form in both traditional dictionaries and grammars. It also serves as\n  the unspoken basis for the commonly accepted axiom that no true\n  synonyms exist, i.e. that different forms must have different meanings\n  (cf. Bloomfield 1933:145, Nida 1958:282, Bolinger 1968:127 for\n  representative statements of this axiom). Following Hjelmslev,\n  Kurylowicz, and Martinet, I will refer to this relationship as the\n  iconicity of ISOMORPHISM.
