The precise meaning of \"voicing\" is important here: are we simply asking whether the vocal chords are vibrating? If we are, then voicing is a binary (yes/no) distinction. For this reason, Phonologists usually use the term <em>sonority</em> to refer to the relative 'strength' of voicing.</p>\n\n<p>A great place to start reading about this is pp. 38-64 in Ferdinand de Saussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\". We have the sense that voicing is not an \"all or nothing\" phenomenon, and de Saussure explains this nicely. </p>\n\n<p>The so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_hierarchy\" rel=\"nofollow\">sonority hierarchy</a> is a well-established method of ranking the relative sonority of sounds, which is closely related to voicing. This is central to modern phonology, check out John Goldsmith's \"<a href=\"http://hum.uchicago.edu/~jagoldsm//Papers/syllables.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Syllable</a>\" for a great overview of modern thought on this question. </p>\n", "Id":"1335", "ParentId":"1290", "CreationDate":"2012-01-25T21:00:23.330", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"550", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-25T21:00:23.330", "CommentCount":"1"}
