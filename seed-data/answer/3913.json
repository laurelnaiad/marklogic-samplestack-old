There is no true vowel in 'world' for me either, the [ɹ] is the syllable nucleus. It doesn't honestly make much sense to me either why Wikipedia and others don't seem willing to transcribe them as such - my guess would be that they haven't yet fully dropped a traditional 'English syllables must have at least one vowel in them' mindset.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not these syllabic consonants are phonemic is a bit of a hairier question. I would venture to guess that they're not - I would say 'fur' is still phonemically /fəɹ/ (or whatever that vowel is), but that /ə/ is one of the vowels that's deleted before /ɹ/, so the word comes out as [fɹ̩ː]. English vowels and their allophony can be pretty screwy.</p>\n", "Id":"3913", "ParentId":"3912", "CreationDate":"2013-06-25T17:41:19.753", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-25T17:41:19.753", "CommentCount":"4"}
