{"Body":"<p>Below you can see how I would do it. I didn't use triangles to be clearer.</p>\n\n<p>I follow Carnie (2012), just instead of a TP, a tense phrase, I used an IP, an inflectional phrase  (see Tallerman 2005). Supposedly the IP structure is the structure that all finite verbs have and all finite verbs have an inflection as far as European languages are concerned.</p>\n\n<p>'Here' is out of the scope of the inflection phrase since it's an adjunct; this type of information is not required by the theta roles of the verb. Also, since 'here' is not under the scope of any of the core arguments and you can't have oblique arguments in a sentence like \"X be X\", it must be an adjunct and therefore lie outside the scope of the IP.</p>\n\n<p>You can generate the tree using this:</p>\n\n<p>[S[IP [DP [D' [NP [N' [N I]]]]] [I' [I am] [NegP [Neg' [Neg not]] [DP [D'[D the][NP[N' [N alien]]]]]]]][DP[D'[D[AdvP[AdvP'[AdvP[here]]]]]</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mtnei.png\" alt=\"Notice: no triangles were used to improve clarity\"></p>\n", "Id":"6310", "ParentId":"4622", "LastEditorUserId":"2972", "CreationDate":"2014-01-04T20:29:12.583", "OwnerUserId":"2972", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-04T20:36:53.980", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "Location":"Oxford, United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2972", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29ca72846bbfe39f8ccfb702680ea250?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3802454", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"44", "CreationDate":"2014-01-04T18:35:16.563", "DisplayName":"Fede", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T01:09:46.557"}, "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-04T20:36:53.980", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "Location":"Oxford, United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2972", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29ca72846bbfe39f8ccfb702680ea250?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3802454", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"44", "CreationDate":"2014-01-04T18:35:16.563", "DisplayName":"Fede", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T01:09:46.557"}}
