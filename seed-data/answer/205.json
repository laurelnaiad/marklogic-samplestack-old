{"Body":"<p>Have you looked at <a href=\"http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W11/W11-0139.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper</a>? I quote the abstract:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>we describe the Baseball Announcers’ Language Linked with General Annotation of Meaningful Events (BALLGAME) project – a text corpus for research in computional semantics. We collected pitch-by-pitch event data for a sample of baseball games and used this data to build an annotated corpus composed of transcripts of radio broadcasts of these games. Our annotation links text from the broadcast to events in a formal representation of the semantics of the baseball game. We describe our corpus model, the annotation tool used to create the corpus, and conclude by discussing applications of this corpus in semantics research and natural language processing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Besides this, many people have worked on creating and/or analysing RoboCup commentary data. I haven't looked for links for that. But I think they ought to be easy enough to find. Try <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/wasp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this website</a> where they have <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/wasp/robocup-clang/corpus.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">the corpus as an XML file</a>. The text within &lt;nl lang=\"en\"&gt; is what you are looking for, I guess.</p>\n", "Id":"205", "ParentId":"178", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T01:57:29.513", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-16T02:16:25.643", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-16T02:16:25.643", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
