{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There is a theory in American Sign Language Syntax (proposed by Neidle et al 2000) that one of the doubled wh-phrases might actually be a topic (dubbed a wh-topic) in which case it follows the syntactic rules for a base generated topic. One of these rules is that if the wh-phrase occurs with a moved topic, it must precede the moved topic, just like any other base generated topic would. So in American Sign Language anyway the wh-phrase is actually first, followed by the other topic. And since you mentioned the articulatory demands/conflicts, it should be noted the that one of the prominent non-manual markers for wh-questions is brows furrowed, and one of the prominent non-manual marker for topic marking is brows raised, obviously there is a conflict, which is one of the reasons that this theory is up for debate (although there is some evidence that the topic+wh marker is slightly different from just the wh marker)</p>\n", "Id":"1971", "ParentId":"1846", "CreationDate":"2012-05-21T02:18:57.467", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1022", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-21T02:18:57.467", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1022", "AccountId":"1497041", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T07:09:33.983", "DisplayName":"StoneRose", "LastAccessDate":"2012-05-31T08:05:51.350", "AboutMe":""}}
