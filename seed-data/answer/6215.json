The English words “sign” and “signify” are both borrowed from Old French, which had them from Latin. English does not allow the cluster /gn/ in word-final position; that is why the /g/ is lost in “sign” but retained in “signify”. It is about phonology, not orthography.</p>\n", "Id":"6215", "ParentId":"6210", "CreationDate":"2013-12-21T15:40:42.103", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2556", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-21T15:40:42.103", "CommentCount":"1"}
