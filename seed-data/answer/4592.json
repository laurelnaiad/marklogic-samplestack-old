{"Body":"<p><a href=\"http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/lmatthewson/pdf/fieldwork.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matthewson 2004's paper</a> on semantic fieldwork distinguishes three kinds of judgements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>grammaticality judgements (i.e., syntactic/morphological well-formedness),</li>\n<li>truth-value judgements (i.e., true or false in a given context), and</li>\n<li>felicity judgements (i.e., acceptable or not acceptable in a given context).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The discussion of (in)felicity judgements suggests that they deal with a speaker's failure to make sure the context satisfies either</p>\n\n<p>(i) (lexically-encoded) presuppositions, or </p>\n\n<p>(ii) Gricean Maxim-induced implicatures.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, she uses the following example to contrast truth-value judgements from felicity judgements.</p>\n\n<p>(1) Context: Two cats are in the room, and they are both asleep.</p>\n\n<p>a. The cats are awake.\nb. The cat is asleep.</p>\n\n<p>(1a) is FALSE, because the cats are both asleep. (1b) is INFELICITOUS because 'the' presupposes something like: the entity referred to is the maximal entity that satisfies the NP restriction in the context, and the maximal entity in the context is both cats, not a single cat</p>\n\n<p>An example of infelicity via failure to satisfy Gricean Maxims would be something like (c):</p>\n\n<p>c. One of the cats is asleep. </p>\n\n<p>(1c) is TRUE, but INFELICITOUS because it implicates that the other cat is awake, and this violates the Maxim of Quantity.</p>\n\n<p>If you consider presuppositions to be grammatically encoded (which I think is the standard view, eg., Heim 1983), then instances of infelicity via presupposition failure would be considered a subset of the 'grammatical errors.' </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if you consider implicatures to be grammatically encoded (not the standard view, but cf. Chierchia, Fox and Spector 2008 on 'scalar implicatures'), then instances of infelicity via Gricean-violations would also be a subset of 'grammatical errors.'</p>\n", "Id":"4592", "ParentId":"4555", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2013-09-29T19:13:23.663", "OwnerUserId":"177", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-02T15:23:42.337", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-02T15:23:42.337", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tqgTp.png", "Id":"177", "AccountId":"896176", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T16:30:42.833", "AboutMe":"<p>Linguistics grad student.
