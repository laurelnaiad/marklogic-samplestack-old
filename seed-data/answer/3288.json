{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>If we see those constructions just as <code>finite + infinitive</code>, I wouldn't know other term different from <em>complex verb phrase</em>. However, your example includes the verb <code>want</code>, which has some particular features. In the sentence <code>Pete wants to paint</code>, the matrix verb <code>want</code> is followed by the nonfinite clause <code>to paint</code>. In English, these clauses do not have an overt subject, so they are said to have a nonfinite null subject called <code>PRO</code>. Thus, the sentence structure is something like <code>Pete wants [PRO to paint]</code>. We think that this null subject PRO is <strong><em>controlled</em></strong> by the subject of the sentence, in this case <code>Pete</code>. You can see the subject as an antecedent of the null pronoun PRO. The sentence would mean something like <code>Peter wants</code><em>himself</em><code>to paint</code>. Verbs such as <code>want</code> or <code>like</code>, which admit this kind of infinitive complements, are called <strong>control verbs</strong>, and the clause with a null PRO subject is a <strong>control clause</strong>. The complete phrase would be then known as <strong>control predicate</strong> or <strong>control structure</strong>. This explains what happens in English, but languages vary in terms of the kind of clauses that allow null subjects.</p>\n", "Id":"3288", "ParentId":"3283", "CreationDate":"2013-02-26T14:37:59.680", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-26T14:37:59.680", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q8I3U.jpg", "Id":"1754", "AccountId":"2338821", "CreationDate":"2013-02-12T08:06:32.000", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a linguistics student interested in semantics.
