{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This is because \"nowhere\" is a combination of \"no\" and \"where\"; \"where\" in this case means \"a place\" instead of acting as a question word. \"Now here\" is always written as two separate words. This also goes back to the tendency of english spelling to not have a letter-to-letter connection to english pronunciation. (Notice that \"ere\" represents two different sounds in the words \"where\" and \"here\"- Then there's also words like \"ear\", \"near\", \"bear\", \"air\"... This is what I dislike most about English.) </p>\n", "Id":"3437", "ParentId":"3432", "CreationDate":"2013-03-27T04:47:21.323", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1901", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-27T04:47:21.323", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vGq9U.jpg", "Id":"1901", "AccountId":"2550250", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"83", "CreationDate":"2013-03-27T03:41:32.680", "DisplayName":"Kaninchen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:14:44.377", "AboutMe":"<p>Ich kann ziemlich gut Deutsch, oder so glaube ich, 和会说一点中文，可是说的不好。Have never formally studied linguistics.</p>\n"}}
