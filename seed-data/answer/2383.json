{"Body":"<p>The modern Moscow school asserts that PIE was predated by Proto-Eurasiatic. It is quite reconstructable at least in terms of vocabulary (examples include *apa for \"father\", *'aku and *wete for \"water\") and some other features (-s ending for the Genitive, *mi(n) for \"I\" and *ti for \"thou\", *ku and *io interrogative pronouns). Unlike PIE, numerals cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Eurasiatic which suggests that people did not know counting yet at the time.</p>\n\n<p>The families, included in Eurasiatic are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Indo-European</li>\n<li>Uralic</li>\n<li>Altaic</li>\n<li>Nivkh</li>\n<li>Chukotko-Kamchatkan</li>\n<li>Eskimo–Aleut</li>\n<li>Etruscan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is further asserted that Proto-Eurasiatic is predated by Proto-Nostratic which includes</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eurasiatic</li>\n<li>Afro-Asiatic</li>\n<li>Kartvelian</li>\n<li>Dravidian</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A large part of Nostratic vocabulary has been reconstructed, you can find a dictionary here: <a href=\"http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/196512/49/00ND_ALL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/196512/49/00ND_ALL.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Further speculation is that Proto-Nostratic was predated by Borean, which includes Nostratic and Dene–Daic (which is subdivided into Dené–Caucasian and Austric).</p>\n", "Id":"2383", "ParentId":"2368", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2012-08-07T06:21:36.510", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-21T18:33:57.630", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-21T18:33:57.630", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
