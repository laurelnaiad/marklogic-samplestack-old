The difference is that the examples 1a–c are clearly predicative, while 2a is purely attributive (modifying a noun), and 2b–c are somewhere in between. </p>\n\n<p>Compare <em>she came first</em>, <em>he arrived late</em>: <em>first</em> belongs to <em>she</em> syntactically, but it also describes the action. Those are called predicative adjectives. Non-predicative adjectives and participles (which are in a way a kind of adjectives) modify only the noun, whereas predicative adjectives are said to modify both the verb and the noun the belong to. The distinction between predicative and non-predicative adjectives is necessarily a bit vague, as can be seen in 2b and 2c, but it can be useful.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing is that attributive adjectives can be defining and non-defining, just like relative clauses (<em>the table that I bought</em> v. <em>the table, which I bought</em>). When a postpositional participle is non-defining, a comma is usually added. Example 2a is a good example of a defining adjective/participle.</p>\n", "Id":"1655", "ParentId":"1654", "CreationDate":"2012-03-16T17:19:27.337", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-16T17:19:27.337", "CommentCount":"2"}
