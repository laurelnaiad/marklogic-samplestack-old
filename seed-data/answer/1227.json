If it's in the dictionary it's real. Unfortunately, collocations (transparent combinations of words preferred for a specific meaning, like \"lack of clarity\" instead of \"missing clarity\") and multiword expressions (MWE, non-transparent collocations, like \"kick the bucket\" for \"die\") often aren't in dictionaries even if they need to be memorized just like \"spaceless\" words. Hm, maybe it's the spaces they object to? </p>\n\n<p>English uses more spaces than other Germanic languages. You can make large compounds in English too but recently made ones are written with spaces and thus probably insufficiently word-like for the sort of posters you told us about.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, it might be they consider it prestigious to use spaceless words instead of collocations and so strive to replace the latter with the former.</p>\n\n<p>So, to your question: other languages use spaces differently, if at all. The other Germanic languages aren't afraid to write newly minted compounds without spaces, and languages like French (if my Francophile French-teacher in high-school is to be believed) and Russian do tend to prefer \"spaceless\" words to standardized collocations. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know of any research specifically looking at this, anyone?</p>\n", "Id":"1227", "ParentId":"1223", "CreationDate":"2012-01-04T08:21:12.227", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-04T08:21:12.227", "CommentCount":"7"}
