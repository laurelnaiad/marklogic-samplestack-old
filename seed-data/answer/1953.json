{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>While Old English did have grammatical gender, it is completely extinct in that native words are not at all perceived as masculine or feminine according to their endings. The survival of perception of gender-based endings for names is probably attributable to extensive language contact with languages that have them. Particularly, as with many European languages, lots of Christian names were imported via Romance languages.</p>\n\n<p>We would expect gendered name endings in the absence of grammatical gender to be peculiar to a few languages like English that both lack gender and have borrowed names extensively.</p>\n\n<p>However, a similar phenomenon could apply in languages which retain grammatical gender whose inflections either have been sound-changed or are distinct from those of a language from which it borrows many names. The result is distinct inflections for common nouns and (subsequently-)imported names. For example, native German nouns inflect with various combinations of /ə/ /n/ /s/, whereas many female given names are instead indicated with /a/.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, most Slavic languages take gender-based endings further: they even inflect surnames and patronymics according to gender. For example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Леонид Ильич Брежнев​</a> had a son named Юрий Леонид<strong>ович</strong> Брежн<strong>ев</strong> and a daughter named Галина Леонид<strong>овна</strong> Брежн<strong>ева</strong>, </p>\n", "Id":"1953", "ParentId":"1634", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T04:21:31.980", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1021", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-18T04:21:31.980", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"176", "WebsiteUrl":"https://launchpad.net/~replicator-snail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KPUcH.png", "Id":"1021", "AccountId":"124682", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T02:34:01.443", "AboutMe":"<p>.
