{"Body":"<p>Definitions of <code>parts of speech</code> and <code>syntactic categories</code> have already been given by Tim Osborne. I would like to add a point on whether there is any evidence to label a word a <code>noun</code> or a <code>preposition</code>, since this is also occurred in question.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say we already know that <em>table</em> is a noun. Then we can take a sentence where this word occurs and try to replace it with other words. If the sentence is still grammatical then the new word is also a noun. For example,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The mouse is under the table.</li>\n<li>The mouse is under the bucket.</li>\n<li>The mouse is under the behind.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>bucket</em> is also a noun since sentence 2 is grammatical, <em>behind</em> is not a noun since sentence 3 is not grammatical. In this way all words can be assigned to parts of speech. </p>\n", "Id":"4042", "ParentId":"4026", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T18:03:14.990", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-24T19:22:27.740", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-24T19:22:27.740", "Score":"-1", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
