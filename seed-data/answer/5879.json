So how many features do we pay attention to?  The minimalist doctrine says 'ignore all of them', but there could also be a 'maximalist doctrine' that says 'pay attention to all of them', in which case many instances of recursion would go away due to feature differences between the levels of the embedding.  So for example 'John's picture of Mary' would not be recursive if you supposed that 'of' assigned a kind of abstract genitive case to Mary that was not present on John.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, most linguists (eg Carnie in his textbook) seem to have assumed that standard PS category features count for recursion and others don't, but there is no satisfactory delineation of what the category features are, so the Minimalist view is probably the most coherent one out there.</p>\n", "Id":"5879", "ParentId":"5875", "CreationDate":"2013-11-10T21:06:27.977", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2705", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-10T21:06:27.977", "CommentCount":"1"}
