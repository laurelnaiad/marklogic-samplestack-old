I think I read somewhere, however, that items are more likely to be borrowed if they are similar in form to your own expressions, since they're easily integrated. I also read that it's usually 'contentful' words like nouns that are borrowed, and things like inflectional morphology and numbers are never borrowed - since why would you borrow what you already have which is nice and stable? German has a lot of English loan words, for example, but probably not many from a language like Javanese or Dyirbal. The chief reasons for that would be proximity to the culture, attitude to the culture - perhaps - but even if the Germans did want to borrow a word from a far-away language, morphosyntactic reasons would have some impact on whether that word was easily integrated and thus taken up. </p>\n", "Id":"2200", "ParentId":"2199", "CreationDate":"2012-07-03T06:51:10.720", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1153", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-03T06:51:10.720", "CommentCount":"1"}
