{"Body":"<p>Yes, there are concrete differences between dependency-based and constituency-based tree representations (D-trees vs. PS-trees). </p>\n\n<p>D-trees have the great advantage that they are minimal compared to PS-trees. Thus one can produce a D-tree for a given sentence with much less effort than one needs to produce the corresponding PS-tree for the same sentence. The number of nodes and edges in D-trees tends to be about half as many as for the corresponding PS-tree. </p>\n\n<p>The proponents of PS-trees will object, however, that minimalism and simplicity are not the entire story. Their objection is of course correct insofar as simplicity alone is of no value. A simpler model is only better if it succeeds at clarifying the phenomenon at hand as well as or better than a more complex model. (The principle is known as Occam's Razor)  </p>\n\n<p>My personal view is that the simpler D-trees can accomplish most anything that the more complex PS-trees can. In the scheme of things, each linguist has to form his/her own opinions about the strength/weaknesses of the competing principles for representing syntactic structure. </p>\n\n<p>To provide a brief and direct answer to the question, D-trees are more suited for those situations where simplicity and transparency are the primary concern. Dependency is now the preferred means for representing syntactic structure in computational linguistics, where one is interested above all in automated parsing of natural language. </p>\n\n<p>Phrase structure, in contrast, remains dominant in theoretical linguistics, where one tends to pay more attention to fine-grained syntactic and semantic distinctions. </p>\n", "Id":"4000", "ParentId":"3420", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T17:19:32.293", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-22T14:17:51.463", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
