{"Body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Beside him, the greyheaded man has let one arm slide<br>\n  awkwardly over his shoulder, [and] is talking and pointing<br>\n  at whatever it is ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your first quote is in fact one of only two full sentences in the poem;  <em>the greyheaded man</em> is the subject of both clauses, and it omits a conjunction between two clauses, which impels the poem forward and really associates the two actions more intimately.</p>\n\n<p>The second really needs its introductory phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>       In the distance, where<br>\n  mountains are clouds, lightning, but no rain.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, as in most of the periods of the poem, the verb (implicitly <em>is</em> or <em>are</em>) is omitted. The sense is <em>In the distance, where mountains are clouds, [is] lightning, but no rain</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>AFTERTHOUGHT:<br>\nThe syntax is actually not particularly unusual - just missing copulas. What's really interesting is the meter: there are two feet missing in that final line. I'd be inclined to read them as pauses on either side of <em>lightning</em>. And <em>lightning</em> and <em>but no</em> are, I think, spondees.</p>\n", "Id":"3337", "ParentId":"3334", "LastEditorUserId":"1597", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T19:22:38.943", "OwnerUserId":"1597", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-08T19:34:08.960", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"27", "Location":"St. Louis, MO", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1597", "AccountId":"1722349", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"180", "CreationDate":"2012-12-19T03:05:47.227", "DisplayName":"StoneyB", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:05:50.170", "AboutMe":"<p>A commercial writer for 20 years, a theatre guy for 30 years before that, once a drummer - until I heard Joe Morello.</p>\n", "Age":"66"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-08T19:34:08.960", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"27", "Location":"St. Louis, MO", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1597", "AccountId":"1722349", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"180", "CreationDate":"2012-12-19T03:05:47.227", "DisplayName":"StoneyB", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:05:50.170", "AboutMe":"<p>A commercial writer for 20 years, a theatre guy for 30 years before that, once a drummer - until I heard Joe Morello.</p>\n", "Age":"66"}}
