Distinguishing them, however, depends on the language - whether there can be two words that differ only by that sound. If this is not the case, then the two consonants are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone\" rel=\"nofollow\">allophones</a></p>\n\n<p>In English, the voiced and unvoiced consonants are not allophones. Aspiration was suggested as a possible reason for not distinguishing them, but I'm not sure if this is the case - aspirated and unaspirated voiceless consonants are allophones in English, but they differ from voiced ones. For example you have:</p>\n\n<p>crap - crab<br>\nbad - bat<br>\nknack - nag</p>\n\n<p>So it might be the recordings that are causing the problem (I don't have quicktime to hear them)</p>\n", "Id":"49", "ParentId":"11", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:08:46.977", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"80", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T00:08:46.977", "CommentCount":"2"}
