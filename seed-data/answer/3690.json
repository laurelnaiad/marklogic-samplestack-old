According to widely accepted theories, Turkish and Germanic languages aren't cognates. And plural endings usually don't get borrowed from one language to another, except a part of a noun.</p>\n\n<p>Are you sure that the Turkish plural ending is ''-er'' and ''-ar''? Not ''-ler'' and ''-lar''? For example: kitap (\"book\") — kitaplar, medrese — medreseler.</p>\n\n<p>The Scandinavian (Norwegian) examples could be: bok (\"book\") — bøker, skole (\"school\") — skoler. So ''-er'', ''-r'', ''-ar'' without ''l''.</p>\n", "Id":"3690", "ParentId":"3689", "CreationDate":"2013-05-11T12:19:27.857", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1773", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-11T12:19:27.857", "CommentCount":"3"}
