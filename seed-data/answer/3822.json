{"Body":"<p>Among ancient languages, there are certain traits of aggluttination in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language#Verbs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hittite</a> (especially in its verbs of mi-class).</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in living languages, then one of the possible suggestions would be verbs of the  regular -ar or -er types in modern Swedish. The -ar- type is a type of verbs of regular declention taking, like the rest of regular Swedish verbs, a similar ending (here, -ar) for all and any personal forms in Present.</p>\n\n<p>Consider e.g. the verb <strong><em>att svara</em></strong> (to answer):</p>\n\n<pre><code>     Sg.                          Pl.\n\n1.  jag svarar                        vi svarar\n\n2.  du svarar                         ni svarar\n\n3.  hen svarar                        de [dom] svarar\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em><strong>NB:</em></strong> <em><strong>hen</em></strong> is a new coinage, presumably a calque from the Finnish <strong><em>hän</em></strong>. Both new Swedish and the Finnish words mean the same: (s)he. The actual and more exact gender-specific pronouns in Swedish are <strong><em>hon</em></strong> for 'she' and <strong><em>han</em></strong> for 'he'. </p>\n\n<p>Now let's make a Past Tense form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   Sg.                          Pl.\n\n1.  jag svarade                 vi svarade\n\n2.  du svarade                  ni svarade\n\n3.  hen svarade                 de [dom] svarade\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, the Passive Form would be</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>svaras</em></strong> (it is answered = ´<strong>svara</strong>+ <strong>s</strong> ') and <strong><em>svarades</em></strong> (it was answered/answering = '<strong>svara</strong>+*<em>de</em>*+<strong>s</strong>').</p>\n\n<p>But there is more of agglunativity in Swedish nouns, though:-)</p>\n\n<p>Consider e.g. the word <strong><em>eld</em></strong> (fire).</p>\n\n<p>The plural form is <strong><em>eld+ar</em></strong> (yes, unlike <em>-or</em>, the <em>-er</em> and <em>-ar</em> endings are applicable for nouns <em>and</em> verbs, although the adjectives have a different plural - or, actually, emphasised - form).</p>\n\n<p>The postpositional definite article is <strong><em>-na</em></strong>; hence, 'the fires' will be </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>eld+ar+na => eldarna</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPD:</strong> the <strong><em>-na</em></strong> here conveys the meaning of <em>both</em> plurality and definitiveness, and can be divided into <strong>-n-</strong> (postpositive plural definite marker) + <strong>a</strong> (emphasised form of a noun applicable in plural only).</p>\n\n<p>So, this form of word can be further structured as <strong><em>eld+ar+n+a => eldarna</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Morover, there is a common Germanic survival of the Genitive case, which is - suprisingly! - <strong><em>s</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Hence, 'of [the] fires' (like in 'light of [the] fires') will be</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>[[eld+ar+n+a+s] ljus] => eldarnas ljus</em></strong></p>\n", "Id":"3822", "ParentId":"3652", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-06-06T18:42:35.667", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-16T16:06:26.790", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
