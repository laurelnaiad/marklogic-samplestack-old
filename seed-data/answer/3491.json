The technical support team at my work is especially trained to use \"issue\" for any thing which is treated by customer as something which needs explanation or fixing; but it's very hard to translate \"issue\" to Russian because all translations have a main sense more closer to some another English word; e.g. \"вопрос\" is \"question\", \"тема\" is \"topic\", \"предмет\" is \"subject\" or \"thing\" or even \"agenda\", and so on. Similar discussions in Russian tends to use \"проблема\", but it's much softer than English \"problem\"; the latter generally means a kind of principal discrepancy, which solving needs even some sacrifice, while Russian \"проблема\" is closer to \"issue\" in its level but not in kind (\"issue\" can be a feature request or even a polite suggestion). So, it's impossible to give a one-to-one translation for English \"issue\" or \"problem\" to Russian; each translation variant needs detection of importance level and selecting a proper equivalent among more than ten similar words. Whether is it similar to colors for you, I don't know, but anyway this isn't for colors.</p>\n", "Id":"3491", "ParentId":"3453", "CreationDate":"2013-04-04T20:15:02.810", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"865", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-04T20:15:02.810", "CommentCount":"1"}
