{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Speech is thousands of years older than writing (the earliest known writing is Sumerian cuneiform -pictographs inscribed in clay). So it has primacy over the written word. According to Crystal (2003:178-9) both speech and writing are recognised as 'alternative, equal systems of linguistic expressions'. Focus on writing is characterised by studies in to literature and therefore style, genre and, perhaps, the notion of linguistic excellence and standards. Historically, speech was not considered worthy of study. In modern times, there has been much wider analysis of speech for a number of reasons:\n1. Prevalence of 'second' language learning.\n2. Investigations in to primary language acquisition.\n3. Cognitive studies in to speech and the language centre of the brain.\n4. Striving for improved standards and teaching methodologies.\n5. etc..</p>\n\n<p>or perhaps for the very fact that not a lot of academic attention had been paid to it before.</p>\n\n<p>Speech is an innate skill that manifests itself without a formal learned environment (taking Krashen's distinction on 'acquisition' and 'learning'). Writing is a learned skill in formal learning settings. Children must learn to talk before they can write. So the primary focus in research is naturally on speech as the starting point of language acquisition.</p>\n", "Id":"2912", "ParentId":"788", "CreationDate":"2012-11-30T10:28:45.687", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1538", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-30T10:28:45.687", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "Location":"Germany", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1538", "AccountId":"1515990", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"161", "CreationDate":"2012-11-30T10:02:02.913", "DisplayName":"Qube", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-28T08:09:38.470"}}
