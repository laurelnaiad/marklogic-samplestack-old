{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I'm not an expert (or even a linguist), and my knowledge on this point is at least 10 years out of date (learning about ASL linguistics in high school from my dad who's an ASL interpreter).  But one system for phonemes in ASL is based on location, movement, and handshape.  For example, the \"A\" handshape can be done either with the base of the thumb touching the side of the hand or with the thumb sticking further out, and either is the same phoneme.  Whereas, if you put the thumb in front of the hand (the \"S\" handshape) that's a different phoneme.  Similarly, the difference in location between upper arm and lower arm is phonemic, but the exact location on the upper arm is not.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language_grammar#Phonology\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia has some more detail</a>.</p>\n", "Id":"482", "ParentId":"237", "CreationDate":"2011-09-24T03:31:33.480", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"276", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-24T03:31:33.480", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://sbseminar.wordpress.com", "Id":"276", "AccountId":"501919", "CreationDate":"2011-09-24T03:11:45.143", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm an assistant professor in mathematics at Indiana and an early adopter of Math Overflow.
