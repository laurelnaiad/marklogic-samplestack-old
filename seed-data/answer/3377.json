I discovered Computational Linguistics while receiving my B.A.Sc in Software Engineering when I built a basic bigram parser for an AI assignment. This caused me to become interested in linguistics and to take a few introductory level courses. I currently have completed my first year of my masters and am currently looking for a thesis topic.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-14T05:21:29.157", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}}
