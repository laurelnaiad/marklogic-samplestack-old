I'm interested in bi-lingualism, social variation, anthropological linguistics and blog about all on MetaphorHacker.net.</p>\n\n<p>I've also been involved in teaching foreign languages and teacher training. I've taught Czech to foreigners and co-written a grammar and textbook (see Czechly.com) and I've worked as a regional language specialist for the US Peace Corps. I've also been the academic director of a private TEFL teacher training school.</p>\n"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>You should clarify the question a bit to make sure you mean 'writing systems', not languages. Spoken language doesn't use spaces (or pauses) in the same way or same place as written language.</p>\n\n<p>But more generally, space in writing is a recent invention to aid in ease of reading. The writing systems of Ancient Greek and Latin did not use spaces. Neither did those of Mesopotamian languages or Ancient Egyptian.</p>\n", "Id":"6142", "ParentId":"6131", "CreationDate":"2013-12-14T13:45:16.817", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2121", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-14T13:45:16.817", "CommentCount":"3"}
