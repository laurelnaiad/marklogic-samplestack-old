{"Body":"<p>In PIE we have</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>dheĝhr</em></strong> <em>day</em> (root dheĝh- \"cycle\")</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>dhoğhos</em></strong> <em>burning</em> (root dheğh- \"to burn\")</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>dius</em></strong> <em>sky, daylight</em> (root dei̯- \"sky\")</p>\n\n<p>All three are not related or their relation is unknown. Traditionally English \"day\" is considered to derive from the PIE root for \"burn\", although the author whom you link in the question points out that it is more likely to derive from PIE root meaning \"cycle\" which already was used for \"day\" and \"yesterday\" (<strong><em>dhĝhi̯es</em></strong>) in PIE, and which also gave for example, Russian \"den'\" \"day\" which indicates that the PIE word for day had an r/n stem, and as such, very archaic. </p>\n", "Id":"5882", "ParentId":"5881", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T06:02:56.533", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-11T06:23:48.710", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-11T06:23:48.710", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
