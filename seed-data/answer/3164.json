{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Most languages (excluding highly polysynthetic ones) generally have a finite set of morphological word forms. From this, it follows that the language's morphology can in the worst case be described as a regular language simply by a disjunction of all possible forms; the question remains how elegant (and how explanatorily adequate) such an approach will be. Affixation can be very easily modeled via finite state automata without the need to explicitly enumerate each possible form, but full reduplication, stem alteration (like suppletion and ablaut) or templatic morphology (as in the semitic languages) require more work.</p>\n\n<p>A good book on the subject is <em>Finite State Morphology</em> by Beesley &amp; Karttunen (see <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). Although it makes reference to a proprietary software (the <strong>xfst</strong> tool), there are open source alternatives that work very analogously.</p>\n", "Id":"3164", "ParentId":"3154", "CreationDate":"2013-02-03T02:43:55.620", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1380", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-03T02:43:55.620", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"1380", "AccountId":"1907225", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"529", "CreationDate":"2012-10-05T03:06:16.113", "DisplayName":"Fryie", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T09:48:02.760", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"26"}}
