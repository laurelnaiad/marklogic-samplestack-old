{"Body":"<p><code>Tomorrow</code> simply becomes a part of a Verbal Phrase (VP):</p>\n\n<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>I'\n. I: might\n. VP\n. . VP\n. . . V: bite\n. . . NP\n. . . . DET: that\n. . . . N: man\n. . PP\n. . . Adv: tomorrow\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, note that there are two possible formal representations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>bite tomorrow</code>, as pictured above;</li>\n<li><code>might tomorrow</code>, when <code>tomorrow</code> becomes a part of epistemic modality verb phrase (<code>I'</code> in your diagram);</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I guess the clash may be caused by mixing <strong>language-specific</strong> and <strong>language-agnostic</strong> semantic graphs.<br>\nThe former are often vulnerable to artifacts that prevent displaying them into a nice tree-style structure. Maybe the simplest example would be separable prefixes in German language:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ich <strong>fange</strong> mit der Arbeit <strong>an</strong> (\"I begin with studying\")</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, VP is <code>mit der Arbeit</code>, but the V itself splits into two words around its VP, which can't be represented with a nice tree. In a language-agnostic semantic graph, there is no such problem.</p>\n", "Id":"3080", "ParentId":"3078", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-01-15T20:30:21.300", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-16T17:11:46.077", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-16T17:11:46.077", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"12", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
