{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I am currently doing a course on stylistics, which includes a lot of syntactical analysis, although I am \"just\" an undergraduate. Our lecturer swears by names such as Toolan, Halliday and Hasan and Simpson. </p>\n\n<p>A couple of specific books we're encouraged to acquire are\n'Language in literature' (1998) Michael Toolan\n'Language through Literature: an introduction' (1997) Paul Simpson\n'Cohesion in English' (1976) M.A.K. Halliday and Ruqaiya Hasan</p>\n\n<p>Particular the Toolan book is an excellent introductory text, in my (and my lecturer's!) opinion. I believe that these are used across both graduate and postgraduate. In any case, they will be a good place to start, even if they are not as comprehensive as more specialised texts! </p>\n\n<p>I'm afraid I don't have much to offer on the other two courses, I've only done basic introductions to those myself. If you're as foundation-less as you say, more basic introductory texts like 'The Study of Language' by George Yule and 'An Introduction to Language' by Victoria Fromkin and Robert Rodman might be a good place to start. They obviously do not only cover the topics that you're interested in, but offer a broader base. </p>\n\n<p>Hope some of this helps!</p>\n", "Id":"3345", "ParentId":"3344", "CommunityOwnedDate":"2013-03-10T13:30:04.713", "CreationDate":"2013-03-10T02:02:33.333", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1837", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-10T02:02:33.333", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1837", "AccountId":"2466137", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"17", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:33:24.770", "DisplayName":"Taneko", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-22T10:21:26.707"}}
