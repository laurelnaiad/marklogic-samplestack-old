{"Body":"<p>I am a native turkish speaker living in İstanbul, 30 years old. I am an architect, really interested in linguistics and I am reading the questions and answers with big enthusiasm. I would like to correct an issue: \"aa\" and \"ağa\" are not the same. It takes two stops to give the sound of aa.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with sigue and his examples of \"cemaat\" and \"müracaat\", which are right. It takes two syllables to pronounce \"aa\" here: \"ce-ma-at\" and \"mü-ra-ca-at\". there are a a lot of ways to use \"ğ\", though. </p>\n\n<p>I found a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache%3armEeOvVfUYUJ%3awww.dilbilimi.net/kilic_erdem_turkiye_turkcesindeki_yumusak_g_unsuzunun_fonetik_analizi.pdf+&amp;hl=tr&amp;gl=tr&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjc43ELcqxNufHdHaI67gMDV2_qeOZvUCFtmTlf16u9ejDQLQk9uUy-pqj6vf8XJwEuaoafrZ_yhWioD8XTExgPnUGkMeme1SQk0O_8HwJEDszV1d-2nI2AEBWR0K3IdAEJrLJL&amp;sig=AHIEtbRv88WgvmExW63qshuxNqVN3Y5xbg\" rel=\"nofollow\">good research on the issue (in Turkish)</a>, that may be helpful for the ones that know turkish already.</p>\n", "Id":"3426", "ParentId":"373", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2013-03-25T14:40:22.280", "OwnerUserId":"1899", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-25T16:21:05.923", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
