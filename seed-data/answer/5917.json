Also note how 'air quotes' in gestures (and a particular structure in speech) are used to convey the officiousness of an element of the  written language: the quote. </li>\n<li>[<strong>Edit in response to OP's comment</strong>] Note how since the last decade and a half, bullet has been given the status of a punctuation mark; a glyph which originates in technical literature and now is in mainstream written English. Also note how there is a new tendency in spoken English to recreate this bulleted structure orally (I am trying to find evidence, name for this).</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"5917", "ParentId":"3359", "LastEditorUserId":"175", "CreationDate":"2013-11-16T16:56:18.710", "OwnerUserId":"2516", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-29T20:26:29.727", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/39075", "Id":"175", "AccountId":"23448", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T13:48:54.423", "AboutMe":"<p>Web developer since 1997.
