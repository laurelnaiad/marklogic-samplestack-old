{"Body":"<p>Yes, <em>I</em> and <em>me</em> are different forms of a lexeme, it wouldn't make any sense to consider them different lexemes. As for grammatical person, <em>I</em> / <em>you</em> / <em>we</em> etc. are sometimes analyzed as one lexeme in NLP applications (morphological analyzes/taggers). In lexicalist grammars, incorporated pronouns are generally referred to as 'pro' regardless of person, number, and so forth.</p>\n", "Id":"6443", "ParentId":"6440", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2014-01-18T02:17:28.877", "OwnerUserId":"2451", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-18T07:03:32.523", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-18T07:03:32.523", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"54", "Location":"Prague, Czech Republic", "DownVotes":"3", "Id":"2451", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"935824", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"782", "CreationDate":"2013-09-09T18:11:01.840", "DisplayName":"Atamiri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:11:49.140", "Age":"36"}}
