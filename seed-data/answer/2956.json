{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The above examples seem very verbose and hard to understand.  I believe the point of the \"thereby\" test is to determine if a particular speech act performs the act that it's describing.  So  \"I apologize\" is an explicit performative because In saying “I apologize” in appropriate circumstances, I thereby apologize.  With a statement like \"I agree\" I believe opening it up to the possibility of lying is misleading.  In saying \"I agree\" in appropriate circumstance, I don't thereby agree.  I already formulated the thoughts in my head that lead to the condition of my agreeing with you.  Saying \"I agree\" is simply informing you of something that already existed before I performed said speech act.</p>\n", "Id":"2956", "ParentId":"2917", "CreationDate":"2012-12-12T01:56:10.713", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1573", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-12T01:56:10.713", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1573", "AccountId":"2136903", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"11", "CreationDate":"2012-12-12T01:56:10.713", "DisplayName":"Jon K", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-12T22:37:01.263"}}
