The Wolof language is primarily oral, and\n  even though a written system has been recently developed, children\n  still do not read and write in their L1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A similar situation exists with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahasa_Indonesia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bahasa Indonesia</a>, the standardized official version of the Malay language in Indonesia. <a href=\"http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ind\" rel=\"nofollow\">23,000,000 speak it as an L1</a>, but over 120,000,000 as an L2. Bahasa Indonesia is the primary language of instruction, and there is wide literacy in that language. So, there are many people who speak their native language orally but who can read and write Bahasa Indonesia. </p>\n", "Id":"2268", "ParentId":"2244", "CreationDate":"2012-07-18T16:15:25.657", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"537", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-18T16:15:25.657", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
