{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The wh-phrase in a free relative has to satisfy the subcategorization requirements of both matrix and embedded verbs. For example, in (b), both the matrix verb like and the embedded verb draw require a dp object. The wh-phrase whatever is a dp which satisfies both requirements.</p>\n\n<p>In (c), however, the matrix verb like requires a dp, and the embedded verb go out requires a pp. The wh-phrase with whomever is a pp and so satisfies the requirements of only the embedded verb, so that the requirements of the matrix verb remain unsatisfied, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.</p>\n\n<p>Free relatives are a problem for the theta criterion because the wh-phrase seems to receive two theta-roles: one from the matrix verb and one from the embedded verb. This means that clause which says that “every argument is assigned one and only one theta-role”.</p>\n", "Id":"6406", "ParentId":"6389", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T21:52:31.127", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2973", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-14T21:52:31.127", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2973", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3809766", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"6", "CreationDate":"2014-01-04T19:07:03.737", "DisplayName":"kiyoshigaang", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T12:24:14.430", "AboutMe":""}}
