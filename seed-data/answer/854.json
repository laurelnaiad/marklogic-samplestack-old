We Latinists trust in corpus research and what Roman grammarians said themselves about what they found acceptable. Of course we have less certainty than with living languages, but overall it isn't really a fundamental problem.</p>\n\n<p>It could even be said that corpus research is more reliable than judgement tests, because people may say they would \"never write\" certain things that they do in fact write on occasion. (Keep in mind that the Latin we know is a literary language: we don't make many claims about spoken Latin. Grammaticality differs between spoken and written English too, at least for most people.) I have heard many Dutchmen claim they pronounce the n of the infinitive (<em>lopen</em>) and plural nouns (<em>apen</em>) who wouldn't budge, even though none of them actually did. Another example is famous linguistics student who said in class \"that is not true, Professor: I don't say <em>don't!\"</em>, then cowered in shame.</p>\n", "Id":"854", "ParentId":"853", "CreationDate":"2011-10-20T00:43:28.400", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-20T00:43:28.400", "CommentCount":"2"}
