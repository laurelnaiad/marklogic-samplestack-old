{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This question was based on the assumption that the transitivity of a complementizer was some inherent feature of it. One of the consequences of that feature would be that the closest nominal c-commanded by that complementizer would be given accusative case. So, if there was such kind of complementizers in English, it would be something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>*I asked if her would go to the party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, as it turns out, that assumption is wrong. What defines a transitive complementizer is precisely the fact that it assigns accusative case to nominals, and not the other way around.</p>\n", "Id":"689", "ParentId":"14", "CreationDate":"2011-10-04T13:43:06.950", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-04T13:43:06.950", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
