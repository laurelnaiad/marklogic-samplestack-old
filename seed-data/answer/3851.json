{"Body":"<p>I have never heard of such a term. And it may even be impossible, <strong>depending on which hypothesis you subscribe to</strong>. According to the below reconstruction, the last common ancestor of the Italic and Germanic branches existed some 5200 years ago, when the Italo-Celtic super-branch split off. That was after the Anatolian and Tocharian branches had split off from the rest, but before the Germano-Albanian super-branch and the Indo-Iranian branch diverged. In other words, the Indo-European languages mainly located in Europe share no common ancestor that excludes the Indo-Iranian branch, and neither do the Germanic and Italic branches.</p>\n\n<p>But other reconstructions may have different ramifications. <strong>[Update: You can see what a mess Proto-Indo-European migration was: it all depends on dating the big yellow arrows in the <a href=\"http://indo-european-migrations.scienceontheweb.net/map_of_indo_european_migrations.html\">map</a> at the bottom.]</strong> Perhaps some reconstruction exists that groups the Italic and Germanic branches closer together than either branch to the Indo-Iranian (super-)branch. Note also that the Greek, Albanian, and Balto-Slavic (super-)branches are rarely grouped closer to <em>both</em> Italic and Germanic than to Indo-Iranian. I therefore do not expect any reconstruction to have a \"European\" super-branch that excludes Indo-Iranian, even if a super-branch may be reconstructed including Italic and Germanic but excluding Indo-Iranian. To put this into perspective, there is no \"non-Germanic\" super-branch including all Indo-European branches except Germanic either.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/acJkS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><em>A <a href=\"http://www.hartleyfamily.org.uk/IE_Language_Tree_by_Warnow.jpg\">chart</a> of the history of the evolution of Proto-Indo-European, with approximate/hypothetical dates.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QvQNx.jpg\" alt=\"http://indo-european-migrations.scienceontheweb.net/map_of_indo_european_migrations.html\"></p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://indo-european-migrations.scienceontheweb.net/map_of_indo_european_migrations.html\">Source</a>.</em></p>\n", "Id":"3851", "ParentId":"3850", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-06-12T03:33:52.610", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-12T04:08:35.637", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-12T04:08:35.637", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
