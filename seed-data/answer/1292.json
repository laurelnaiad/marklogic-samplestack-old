{"OwnerDisplayName":"user325", "Body":"<p>Voicing is gradient in the sense that in some languages, voicing onset time begins sooner than in others. For example, <a href=\"http://www.lingref.com/isb/4/018ISB4.PDF\">Spanish voiced stops are more voiced than their English counterparts</a> (also see Lisker and Abramson 1964).  What English counts as a /b/, with little or no prevoicing of the actual stop segment, would be phonetically equivalent, on the basis of VOT, to a Spanish /p/. </p>\n\n<p>Is it also gradient that particular sounds are more voiced than others? I do not know for sure, but since the level of difficulty varies in voicing different segments, I'd say possibly. For example, it's very easy -- in fact the default -- to voice vowels, and relatively difficult to maintain voicing through the complete oral closure during a stop. If this intuition is true, it will be easier and thus more common for [z] to be fully prevoiced than [dz] or [dd].</p>\n", "Id":"1292", "ParentId":"1290", "CreationDate":"2012-01-17T15:00:02.743", "Score":"10", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-17T15:00:02.743", "CommentCount":"4", "comments":[]}
