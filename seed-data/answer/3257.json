{"Body":"<p>TL;DR: <strong>Option D is the answer, and Option E may be an answer with minor corrections.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am affiliated with a company that develops a formatting engine, so let me tell how we do it in printing industry.</p>\n\n<p>The decision point comes from an understanding of Unicode sequence, and difference of RTL (Right-to-Left) Unicode sequences to a plain text.</p>\n\n<p>In a Unicode text, you will have the following sequence of character codes. E.g., <code>The title says</code>, then space and quotation mark, and then the string \"פעילות הבינאום\" <strong>in their natural, RTL, order</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>פ</li>\n<li>ע</li>\n<li>י</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So, when a rendering engine performs typesetting, it takes those characters in their natural order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It takes an English text;</li>\n<li>a space;</li>\n<li>a quotation mark;</li>\n<li><sup>(1)</sup> Note, there is no breakable space here</li>\n<li>and the first Hebrew word, פעילות, <strong>starting from \"פ\"</strong>;</li>\n<li>then it takes another space symbol;</li>\n<li>and then it finds out that the <strong>second</strong> Hebrew word, הבינאום, does <strong>not</strong> fit into the first printable line.</li>\n<li>The rendering engine takes whatever fits and <strong>breaks the line</strong> at the nearest break location (a breakable space between the two Hebrew words).</li>\n<li>Then it starts processing glyphs <em>within</em> the line: English text is rendered with LTR rules, while Hebrew text is rendered with RTL rules. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This distinction within the line (RTL vs. LTR) can be resolved in a different manner. Some formatting standards assume detection by text codepage; others, like XSL-FO, are being specifically instructed by <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/xslfo/prop_writing-mode.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">writing-mode property</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So it will be naturally Option D.</p>\n\n<p>You should also consider that RTL does not imply Bottom-to-Top. This is why Option A is not relevant.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Option E is essentially the same as Option D, only having text alignment set to <strong>both</strong>, except that the quotation mark will be aligned together with the first word of the Hebrew text since there is no breakable space in <sup>(1)</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>I must admit that you have prepared your question very well, so I don't even need screenshots! :)</p>\n", "Id":"3257", "ParentId":"3250", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-02-23T06:23:26.023", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-23T06:37:27.930", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-23T06:37:27.930", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
