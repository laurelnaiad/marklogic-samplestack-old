{"Body":"<p>I guess, this question has both medical and linguistic senses. The latter is better to be asked on medical sites, so let me just answer it from the linguistic point of view.</p>\n\n<p>This phenomenon is called <strong>Sub-vocalization</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, sub-vocalization is considered to produce a negative effect for perception of written text. For example, techniques for <strong>rapid reading</strong> include suppressing your natural habit of sub-vocalizing when reading.</p>\n\n<p>When you read a text in non-phonetic writing system (Chinese is the most prominent example), sub-vocalization is <strong>not</strong> involved, and this is why many rapid reading techniques are simply N/A for reading Chinese.<br>\nIn other words, one can perceive Chinese text more rapidly (than as in alphabetic systems) without special training, specifically because the process is not slowed down by sub-vocalization.</p>\n\n<p>There was a <a href=\"http://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/can-chinese-readers-scan-large-amounts-of-text-faster-more-accurately-than-their\">relevant question</a> at Chinese.SE, please take a look at it.</p>\n", "Id":"3064", "ParentId":"3062", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-01-12T03:53:08.587", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-12T07:30:40.363", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-12T07:30:40.363", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
