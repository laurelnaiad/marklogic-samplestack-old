{"Body":"<p>This category by its name sounds like the opposite of \"defective\" where one or more usual forms are absent, generally used of verbs.</p>\n\n<p>While I'm not sure whether this category of nouns exists in English I can think of a couple of English nouns that have more than one plural with differing senses (two plurals with the same sense is much more common).</p>\n\n<p>The most commonly discussed example is probably <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fish#English\"><strong><em>fish</em></strong></a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plural 1 is the usual, irregular plural actually taking the same form as the singular <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fish#English\"><strong><em>fish</em></strong></a>.</li>\n<li>Plural 2 is the regular plural <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fishes#English\"><strong><em>fishes</em></strong></a> but is restricted to referring to \"several kinds of fish\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another one I came across through participation in Wiktionary is <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/datum#English\"><strong><em>datum</em></strong></a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plural 1 is the irregular plural also alternatively (and sometimes controversially) used as a mass noun <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/data#English\"><strong><em>data</em></strong></a>.</li>\n<li>Plural 2 is the quite unexpected regular plural <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/datums#English\"><strong><em>datums</em></strong></a>, used only the field of cartography to mean \"fixed reference points\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which reminds me of another, also controversial case of multiple singular forms, but not so straightforward:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dice#English\"><strong><em>Dice</em></strong></a> is the accepted plural of <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/die#English\"><strong><em>die</em></strong></a> but <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dice#English\"><strong><em>dice</em></strong></a> is also in common use as a singular in which case it is an invariant noun.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"245", "ParentId":"244", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-09-17T09:54:44.807", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-17T10:04:05.713", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-17T10:04:05.713", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
