{"Body":"<p>You're absolutely right - the choice is completely arbitrary. Generally, before the publication of <em>The Sound Pattern of English</em> (Chomsky &amp; Halley 1968), whichever underlying representation required the fewest number of rule derivations to produce the output forms was chosen, i.e., whichever was the most elegant.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the following rule set describing (simplified) Korean stop allophony:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/p/ -&gt; [b] / V_V\n/p/ -&gt; [p] / otherwise\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would be preferable to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/b/ -&gt; [p] / #_\n/b/ -&gt; [p] / _#\n/b/ -&gt; [b] / otherwise\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Post-<em>SPE</em>, sound segments were reanalyzed as bundles of features - for example, [p] is shorthand for:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[-voiced\n  labial\n -sonorant\n -continuant]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In <em>SPE</em> phonology, all features in the phonetic form of a segment are specified. However, the phonemic form omits features that are derived through rules - this is known as <em>underspecification</em>. For example, in <em>SPE</em> phonology:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ labial      -&gt; [+voiced] / [+voiced] _ [+voiced]\n -sonorant\n -continuant]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that only the modified features are written after the <code>-&gt;</code> arrow, and that only relevant features in the surrounding environment are written after the <code>/</code>, rather than whole feature sets.</p>\n", "Id":"343", "ParentId":"342", "LastEditorUserId":"76", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T02:08:12.437", "OwnerUserId":"76", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-21T03:09:05.673", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"35", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/alekstorm", "Id":"76", "AccountId":"411223", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:34:32.303", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Urbana, IL", "DownVotes":"17", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1043", "DisplayName":"Alek Storm", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T07:20:27.393"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-21T03:09:05.673", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"35", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/alekstorm", "Id":"76", "AccountId":"411223", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:34:32.303", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Urbana, IL", "DownVotes":"17", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1043", "DisplayName":"Alek Storm", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T07:20:27.393"}}
