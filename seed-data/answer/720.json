{"Body":"<p>Some of the difficulty of spelling in English arrises from the fact that we borrowed so many words from other languages (often changing their pronunciation to fit English phonological explanations but keeping their spelling to preserve their etymology) and because our highly populated vowel system appears to be far less stable than the 5-vowel systems we see in other languages.  This probably accounts for much of the belief that many people have that languages like Italian and Spanish are \"more phonetic\" than English.</p>\n\n<p>Also: English originiated as an amalgamation of several germanic languages before borrowing so heavily from other languages.  Yet, it was written down using the Roman alphabet.  So, even before all the historical changes, English writing was probably not \"as phonetic\" as languages which are more like Italian.</p>\n", "Id":"720", "ParentId":"637", "LastEditorUserId":"392", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T16:11:20.823", "OwnerUserId":"392", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-06T19:42:44.037", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.LingEducator.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"392", "AccountId":"957254", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"251", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T14:13:10.473", "DisplayName":"Ocumpaugh", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-10T12:37:04.217"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-06T19:42:44.037", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.LingEducator.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"392", "AccountId":"957254", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"251", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T14:13:10.473", "DisplayName":"Ocumpaugh", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-10T12:37:04.217"}}
