{"Body":"<p>Really, it depends a lot on the region of the world you're from.</p>\n\n<p>The isolating nature of the English language and Chinese, and, to a slightly lesser extent, the rest of the Germanic languages, as well as the Romance languages, is certainly not a norm worldwide. Living languages, in fact, on average incorporate about as much information into their words as old indo-european languages did. Check out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_language\">polysynthetic languages</a> to see extreme examples of this.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, old indo-european languages do seem to have rather complex rules, incorporating many seemingly different lexical forms, about noun inflection and verb conjugation, making them perhaps in a real sense \"harder\" to learn than agglutinative languages. I'll try to address why by pasting together some hypotheses and some facts.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>PIE may have resulted largely from the influence of a Uralic superstrate on a NW or NE Caucasian or related language, or from the influence of both on a third language. <a href=\"http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art247e.pdf\">Source.</a></p></li>\n<li><p>PIE quickly spread far and wide, probably multiple times, leading to</p>\n\n<p>a) a premium on a modicum of mutual intelligibility for trade, concomitant with</p>\n\n<p>b) a bunch of L2 (second-language) speakers exhibiting substrate\npressure in the form of phonetic changes (e.g., loss of the\nlaryngeals) and, more importantly, grammatical changes.</p></li>\n<li><p>At the same time, there is <em>possibly</em> a natural cycle of isolating->agglutinative->inflecting->isolating in languages. (Every step of this cycle has been observed, although the entire cycle has never been observed.) PIE was past an agglutinative stage and fit quite squarely within the \"inflecting\" paradigm when it spread.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'll mention one, perhaps rather conservative, deduction that can be drawn from this: verbal paradigms which once made sense (3) started making less sense (2b) but were kept (2a). Hence, we have to learn the principal parts of a verb when learning Greek or Latin. Most contemporaries of Proto-Indo-European probably had even richer inflecting/agglutinating structure, but probably fewer irregularities.</p>\n\n<p>So many other conjectures can be formed, so I'll leave the rest of the deductions to you, since it's really hard to say that this results in any one particular effect rather than another.</p>\n", "Id":"318", "ParentId":"315", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T16:06:21.453", "OwnerUserId":"84", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-12T09:17:34.703", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
