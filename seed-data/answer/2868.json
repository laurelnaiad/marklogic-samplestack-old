Another theory would be that a language dies when it's second last speaker does, because the last remaining speaker can not use that language with anyone, I.e. it is not a means of communication any more. \nIf you wan to know more about language death then you should consult Crystal (2002) <em>Language Death</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"2868", "ParentId":"2864", "CreationDate":"2012-11-19T23:09:39.727", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"783", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-19T23:09:39.727", "CommentCount":"1"}
