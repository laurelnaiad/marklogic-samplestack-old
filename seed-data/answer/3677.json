{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This is a bit of a philosophical question, but I agree with your reasoning: in theory, or in principle, a language could contain an infinite number of different morphemes (one of which might have to have an infinite length, but that doesn't matter).</p>\n\n<p>However, in practice, one observes that the number of new, intelligible sentences recorded on the Internet every day is very large, whereas the creation of new, intelligible morphemes is very small. For all practical purposes, it makes sense to treat the number of possible sentences as infinite, and the number of morphemes as nearly fixed.</p>\n\n<p>The number of morphemes becomes larger already if you include more, such as every unknown letter combination recorded; but it makes more sense to only count as morphemes combinations that are to some degree understood by people. Of what we count as newly created sentences, most are to some degree understood by people.</p>\n", "Id":"3677", "ParentId":"3674", "CreationDate":"2013-05-09T05:31:53.787", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-09T05:31:53.787", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
