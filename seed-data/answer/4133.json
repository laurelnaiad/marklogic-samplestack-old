{"Body":"<p>It's probably worth making the more general point here that not everyone agrees with a Bloomfieldian 'constructive' conception of morphology, in which words are built-up from sub-word units. There are a few morphologists working within an 'abstractive' word &amp; paradigm based framework (Jim Blevins' terminology), where words, the basic units, are associated with paradigms, e.g. 'dogs' is a basic unit associated with the 'plural' cell of a paradigm. Formatives and inflection etc. are treated as epiphenomenal abstractions over the lexicon. See for example the work of Jim Blevins at Cambridge , and his 2006 paper 'word based morphology' (can find here: <a href=\"http://www.jpblevins.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jpblevins.net/</a>) for an intro to this kind of approach. </p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question: The reality of 'zero morphs' is controversial, in the sense that word and paradigm models (which do seem to be in the minority) do not even commit to the reality of any sub-word unit (other than as an abstraction), and this includes zero morphs.</p>\n", "Id":"4133", "ParentId":"4113", "LastEditorUserId":"2328", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T16:43:29.677", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-08T01:20:50.807", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
