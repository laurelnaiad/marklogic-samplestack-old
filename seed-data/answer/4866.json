We know this for two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We know that Greek doesn't allow a syllable to begin with a geminate, because if it did, there should be words where this occurs initially (e.g. *ττα) or after a consonant (e.g. *γλῶρττα), and such words don't exist.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vowels followed by a geminate make a heavy (a.k.a. \"long\") syllable, as can be seen from their scansion in poetry. E.g. in Iliad 1.3 πολλὰς δ’ ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδὶ προΐαψεν, the first syllable must be heavy to satisfy the meter, so we know it's πολ- not πο-. A similar, non-metrical source of evidence is the comparatives and superlatives of o-stem adjectives, whose form varies according to the weight of the preceding syllable: -ότερος/-ότατος after a heavy syllable, -ώτερος/-ώτατος after a light syllable. Adjectives with a geminate before the -o- take the former set: περιττός, περιττότερος, περιττότατος. This shows that the syllabification is πε.ριτ.τός not πε.ρι.ττός.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"4866", "ParentId":"4864", "CreationDate":"2013-11-07T17:46:26.910", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-07T17:46:26.910", "CommentCount":"1"}
