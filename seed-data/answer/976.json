Two and a Half Centuries of Verbal Inflection in Nuremberg. 2000</p>\n\n<p>Note, however, that frequency is not the only variable predictive of regularization rate. Another factor identified for English is phonological similarity: i.e. verbs like sing ~ sang will regularize more slowly because of the presence of phonologically similar alternations with other irregular verbs, e.g. ring ~ rang.
