Similar to what occurs in biology where you have gender, species and variation of species (Vitis vinifera is \"grape\" but you may diferentiate grape as \"cabernet\", \"merlot\", if you are a specialist, specialty means, this detail is meaningful to you...). A biologist talking about reproduction in a group of animals will probably be in need to define how many 'he'-animals are there and how many 'she'-animals, for this information is meaningful to the context. If gender is not important in some context, there's no need for gender opposition.\nThe unmarked term is more extense, more abstract and can be used in more cases. It doesn't mean it is \"better\", it depends on what information is important in a certain situation.</p>\n", "Id":"2141", "ParentId":"2139", "CreationDate":"2012-06-19T13:29:48.220", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1107", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-19T13:29:48.220", "CommentCount":"1"}
