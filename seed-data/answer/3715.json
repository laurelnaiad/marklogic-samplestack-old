{"Body":"<p>My estimation would be between 1000 and 500 years ago, after population drifts but before the European conquest. But that's just a guess and you won't get anything better than that. Counting languages today is extremely difficult, now imagine counting languages of 1000 years ago, it can't be done. We don't know how many languages were spoken in the Americas, nor how many of those disappeared before the arrival of the Conquistadores - that information is lost for ever. The same goes for all other regions.</p>\n", "Id":"3715", "ParentId":"3706", "LastEditorUserId":"2785", "CreationDate":"2013-05-15T10:49:50.187", "OwnerUserId":"1975", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-20T23:46:17.747", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"79", "WebsiteUrl":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/21258/joe-pineda", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3829797d6709334d9a07fe18dfcb553f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2785", "AccountId":"11104", "CreationDate":"2013-11-26T03:56:44.347", "AboutMe":"<p>Developing professionally since 11 years ago.
