The proximate is a traditional third person, while the obviative (also frequently called \"fourth person\") marks a less important third person if more than one third person is taking part in an action. </p>\n  \n  <p>In other words, Ojibwe uses the obviative to avoid the confusion that could be created by English sentences such as <em>John and Bill were good friends, ever since the day he first saw him</em> (who saw whom?). In Ojibwe, one of the two participants would be marked as proximate (whichever one was deemed more important), and the other marked as obviative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that <strong>which</strong> NP gets marked proximate or obviative is determined<br>\nby the speaker's decision about which NP is more important.  </p>\n", "Id":"4105", "ParentId":"4101", "CreationDate":"2013-08-02T19:09:20.600", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-02T19:09:20.600", "CommentCount":"6"}
