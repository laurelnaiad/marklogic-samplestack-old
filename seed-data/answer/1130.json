{"Body":"<p>Words with higher frequency can remain stable with higher variability in their pronunciation than words of lower frequency, because their occurrence is predictable and their recognition is not seriously hampered by variable pronunciation. Words with higher variability are more likely to significantly change in the course of language use.</p>\n\n<p>Introducing frequency into the picture predicts that some words are more likely to change than others, but doesn't explain the trend towards simplicity of production. If the notion of simplicity of production is going to be useful, it will have to take on a somewhat narrow sense: reduced forms of words are not easier to produce, but they are simpler to produce. In other words, a highly skilled speaker of a language can use their knowledge about which variations are used in the speech community <em>and</em> their ability to pronounce words of the language with high precision to produce a word in a simpler, but still highly-controlled way. It is, after all, easier for second-language learners to produce non-reduced forms accurately than reduced forms. The idea seems reasonable, but I don't know of any laboratory studies purporting to measure simplicity of production, although there is a good chance they would have escaped my attention. </p>\n\n<p>See:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://books.google.com.br/books/about/Frequency_of_use_and_the_organization_of.html?id=W20t_5AXeaYC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bybee, Joan (2007) Frequency of use and the Organization of Language.
