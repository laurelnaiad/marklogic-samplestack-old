For example the sign DEAF, prototypically made with the '1' handshape making contact first with the cheek and then moving to contact the jaw (as in the sentence FATHER DEAF) can have these locations reversed if the preceding sign, when part of the same constituent, has a final location more proximal to the jaw (as in the sentence MOTHER DEAF). Both forms of the sign DEAF are acceptable to native signers.\"</p>\n\n<p>Picture at\n<a href=\"http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/metathesis.htm\">http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/metathesis.htm</a></p>\n", "Id":"1626", "ParentId":"1136", "CreationDate":"2012-03-13T08:26:49.927", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"834", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-13T08:26:49.927", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"834", "AccountId":"1319623", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"136", "CreationDate":"2012-03-13T05:33:50.547", "DisplayName":"joe martin", "LastAccessDate":"2012-03-14T02:09:17.050"}}
