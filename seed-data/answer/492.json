{"OwnerDisplayName":"onomatomaniak", "Body":"<p>I think envisioning these sentences without the \"behind him\" included makes it clear why the first three examples are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<p><em>President Clinton appeared at the podium accompanied by three senators and Margaret Thatcher.

Adding a spatial reference (\"behind him\") doesn't really change the purpose of that sentence, in my mind; it just adds extra information. </p>\n\n<p>Just as the example I've written is redundant (in that we already knew the senators were present), so too is the original example.</p>\n", "Id":"492", "ParentId":"489", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T08:37:29.997", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-23T08:37:29.997", "CommentCount":"2", "comments":[]}
