{"Body":"<p>As a native Hebrew speaker i have ever heard the root שׂ.ל.מ (s.l.m), or any of it conjugations used in the context of submission. Neither does the root שׁ.ל.מ (Sh.l.m).\nThe word שלם (shalem) means, as the Wikipedia article states, whole (and all its derived meanings like perfect or or complete) or peace.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D\">Wiktionary</a> entry on the root and its various meanings.</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew word for submission (not necessarily religious) is כְּנִיעה (kni'a), and devoted can be translated as מָסוּר (masur, literaly- to give yourself) from the root מ.ס.ר. But there is no particular word with this meaning in a religious context.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect the extra meaning for the root, in Arabic, came from the religious context, as the name of the religion Islam and the word for submission <strong>إسلام</strong> (ʾIslām), and one who submits is is translated <strong>مسلم‎</strong> (muslim), also the name for an Islamic man.  </p>\n\n<p>Although the Hebrew and Arabic are close, I think this word in particular got its meaning after the two languages split.</p>\n", "Id":"3269", "ParentId":"3221", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "CreationDate":"2013-02-24T14:56:49.500", "OwnerUserId":"1785", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-25T00:37:01.580", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
