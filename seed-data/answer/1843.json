Pronouncing \"ng\" as /n/ is seen as less educated or less formal.</p>\n\n<p>In earlier times, pronouncing \"going\" as \"goin\" (with an /n/) was the mark of the English aristocracy.  Pronouncing it with an /ŋ/ was more common among the lower classes.(See an article on <a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=734\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Log</a> for some information about this historical switch.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>How exactly this change came about is actually rather interesting from a historical point of view.  The suffix marking verbal nouns (like in \"a building\") was \"-inge\" in Middle English, while the suffix marking progressive participles (like in \"I'm running\") was \"-inde\".  The two merged together in southern England in the 1300s, spreading slowly but never quite taking over the whole English-speaking world.</p>\n", "Id":"1843", "ParentId":"1841", "CreationDate":"2012-04-26T17:06:12.467", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"314", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-26T17:06:12.467", "CommentCount":"1"}
