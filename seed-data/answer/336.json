{"Body":"<p>I'm not an expert, but in my experience this is common in Galician and Spanish. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>La Juana dijo que vendr√≠a. ([The] Juana said she would come.)</li>\n<li>O Pepe dixo que non sabe. ([The] Pepe said he doesn't know.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The cultural implications are delicate. In Spanish, and to my very subjective perception, it has a connotation of uneducated language or extremely coloquial register. In Galician, however, it sounds perfectly OK and does not connote an uneducated person; maybe because of the Portuguese proximity (see answer by @Otavio Macedo).</p>\n", "Id":"336", "ParentId":"5", "LastEditorUserId":"186", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T21:46:08.650", "OwnerUserId":"186", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-24T17:04:44.313", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"16", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.verdewek.com/work", "Id":"186", "AccountId":"73150", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T19:21:02.950", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at <a href=\"http://www.incipit.csic.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Incipit</a>, where I read, write, think, have coffee and also write code every now and then.\n<br/><br/>\nI have extensive experience in method engineering, software methodologies, conceptual modelling, software development techniques, technical writing and project management.\n<br/><br/>\nI'm also a partner in two businesses where we develop large software applications and services, and I participate in standardisation projects with <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aenor.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AENOR</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nYou can also find me on <a href=\"http://es.linkedin.com/in/cesargon00\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a> and I keep a couple of <a href=\"http://neh2.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs</a>.</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Galicia, Spain", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"211", "DisplayName":"CesarGon", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-18T22:56:14.753"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-24T17:04:44.313", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"16", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.verdewek.com/work", "Id":"186", "AccountId":"73150", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T19:21:02.950", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at <a href=\"http://www.incipit.csic.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Incipit</a>, where I read, write, think, have coffee and also write code every now and then.\n<br/><br/>\nI have extensive experience in method engineering, software methodologies, conceptual modelling, software development techniques, technical writing and project management.\n<br/><br/>\nI'm also a partner in two businesses where we develop large software applications and services, and I participate in standardisation projects with <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aenor.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AENOR</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nYou can also find me on <a href=\"http://es.linkedin.com/in/cesargon00\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a> and I keep a couple of <a href=\"http://neh2.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs</a>.</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Galicia, Spain", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"211", "DisplayName":"CesarGon", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-18T22:56:14.753"}}
