{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>To my opinion, as long as a language is not <em>insanely</em> difficult, constructed languages will only be of a very limited range of complexity, since communication and languages are <em>by themselves</em> complex. This, and the fact that children seem to be able to perfectly well learn even the most puzzingly complex language, leads me to the assumption that all questions as to whether a language will be gaining widespread usage will not be dealing with intrinsic properties of that language, but much more with external factors. </p>\n\n<p>One can make a case that modern Hebrew is in a way a constructed language (even if it is not constructed from nothing) and it did gain widespread adoption; and for Esperanto there's nowadays native speakers as well. However, in most of the cases I believe people simply don't see the reason for learning a constructed language. <em>Linguae francae</em> are generally acquired from culturally dominant and prestigeous groups, but constructed languages simply have no such group of speakers that would inspire others to take their lead. </p>\n\n<p>In any way, what is certain, is that once a language - constructed or not - is spoken routinely by a sizeable number of speakers, it is inevitably going to change.</p>\n", "Id":"2683", "ParentId":"2377", "CreationDate":"2012-10-11T21:21:00.433", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1380", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-11T21:21:00.433", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"1380", "AccountId":"1907225", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"529", "CreationDate":"2012-10-05T03:06:16.113", "DisplayName":"Fryie", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T09:48:02.760", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"26"}}
