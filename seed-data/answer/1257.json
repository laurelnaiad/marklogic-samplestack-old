I work on Tlingit, a critically endangered language of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and southeast Alaska. I also have extensive interests in the related Athabaskan languages, language documentation theory and practice, orthography design, morphological theory, phonological theory, and the syntax of noun phrases and relativization.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using TeX and friends for more than a decade. I use Xe(La)TeX, fontspec, memoir, and BibLaTeX extensively, and I am working on a BibLaTeX style for linguistics publications. Other packages I use frequently include pst-jtree, expex, and booktabs. I’m learning PGF/TikZ and considering developing a library to produce autosegmental representation diagrams. I do my writing in TeXShop, and my TeX programming in MacVim, having abandoned FSF Emacs and XEmacs due to their perpetually disappointing Unicode rendering.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"5", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"866", "DisplayName":"James C.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-03T19:13:48.097"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>Bowls, pots, and cups are the most common everyday things in European cultures that are hollow. A conventional insult is that one’s head is hollow. So transfer from one to the other is fairly easy via slang. Gourds are used for the same insult in tropical areas where they are cultivated or harvested.</p>\n\n<p>I think ‘has a hollow head’ is a pretty common insult cross-linguistically, but I’m not aware of any studies on the topic. There was once a journal called “Maledicta” where such things may have been discussed. Another common insult is that one’s head is full of water, or that it is full of fat, or that it is full of a starchy paste (mashed potatoes, sago palm mush, oatmeal, rice pudding, etc.). An inspired researcher could conceivably investigate this by trawling through a huge pile of dictionaries and ethnographies. It’d be a very long term project to gather enough data to really make the argument solid though. Either that or it would require a large number of collaborators, or undergraduate assistants, or the like.</p>\n", "Id":"1257", "ParentId":"1251", "CreationDate":"2012-01-11T01:17:09.750", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"511", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-11T01:17:09.750", "CommentCount":"3"}
