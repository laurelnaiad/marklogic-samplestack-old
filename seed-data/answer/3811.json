{"Body":"<p>If you look at phonetic implementation of these sounds, American English <code>/ð/</code> is often pronounced a lot like an affricate <code>[̪dð]</code> when in onset position (not just in the stereotyped pronunciation of Chicago, but in other dialects as well).  If a BP learner of English hears such a sound, it is unsurprising that they will classify it according to the closest match in their native phonology (which according to your description of BP, would be <code>[d]</code>).  </p>\n\n<p>Your example of \"with\" is odd, since in many (most?) dialects of English, <code>/ð/</code> does not occur syllable-finally in that word (rather it's <code>θ</code>); in any event, the likely explanation for <code>/ð/ → [f]</code> (instead of <code>[s]</code> or <code>[z]</code>) has to do with segmental cues: both <code>[ð]</code> and <code>[f]</code> are fairly quiet fricatives, while <code>[s]</code> and <code>[z]</code> are quite loud (because the tongue forms a groove that channels a high-velocity air stream right at the back of the teeth, causing lots of loud turbulence.  This makes <code>[ð]</code> and <code>[f]</code> more perceptually similar than say <code>[ð]</code> and <code>[s]</code>.</p>\n", "Id":"3811", "ParentId":"3728", "LastEditorUserId":"1616", "CreationDate":"2013-06-04T20:14:01.517", "OwnerUserId":"1616", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-05T14:12:25.800", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dan.mccloy.info", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "Id":"1616", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1833084", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"176", "CreationDate":"2012-12-28T03:37:29.483", "DisplayName":"drammock", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-20T22:25:00.903", "AboutMe":"<p>Phonetician</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-05T14:12:25.800", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dan.mccloy.info", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "Id":"1616", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1833084", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"176", "CreationDate":"2012-12-28T03:37:29.483", "DisplayName":"drammock", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-20T22:25:00.903", "AboutMe":"<p>Phonetician</p>\n"}}
