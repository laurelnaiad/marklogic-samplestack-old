Some deaf speakers use what is called \"Pidgin Signed English,\" which is a blend of English and ASL.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://deafness.about.com/cs/signfeats2/a/pidginsign.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://deafness.about.com/cs/signfeats2/a/pidginsign.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nchearingloss.org/pse.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nchearingloss.org/pse.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>The reason that many people who are deaf from birth have trouble acquiring a first language is that many aren't identified as deaf, or taught sign language, until they're well into the critical period of language acquisition, and consequently don't get enough exposure to sign language early on.

This means that they must learn to read and write in a widespread spoken language in order to become literate.   So, for example, we see ASL users' and deaf educators' learning and teaching English.   </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/literacy1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/literacy1.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>To sum up, we don't need to speculate about whether congenitally deaf sign language users have a language to think in.
