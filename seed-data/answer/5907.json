{"Body":"<p>As has been noted in the comments, [s] and [ɕ] (sometimes broadly transcribed as [ʃ]) are not in complementary distribution in Japanese. However, they <em>can</em> be analyzed as allophones of the same phoneme.</p>\n\n<p>The following rule can be used to explain some of the facts:</p>\n\n<p>/s/ --> [ɕ] before [i], [s] elsewhere</p>\n\n<pre><code>[asa] 'morning'\n[ɕi] 'four'\n[aɕi] 'foot'\n[isu] 'chair'\n[seki] 'cough'\n[heso] 'belly button'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, [ɕ] also appears before other vowels besides [i]:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[iɕa] 'doctor'\n[hoɴɕuː] 'Honshu'\n[ɕoːyu] 'soy sauce'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This leads to an analysis in which it is sensible to treat /ɕ/ as its own phoneme.</p>\n\n<p>Not counting the less nativized loanword pronunciations of words (like [siː] for the English letter 'C'), we never get [s] before [i]. Related forms like [osu] 'press-PRESENT' and [oɕita] 'press-PAST' give us further evidence that at least some instances of [ɕ] before [i] are likely surface realizations of /s/.</p>\n\n<p>So, one analysis that captures all of the facts is that there are two phonemes--/s/, which has the allophones [s] and [ɕ], and /ɕ/, which always surfaces as [ɕ].</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: In response to comments below, here is an alternative analysis that can also capture the facts:</p>\n\n<p>We observe that palatalized versions of consonants may appear before [a], [o], and [u]:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[kʲoku] 'piece of music'\n[nʲuːiɴ] 'hospitalization'\n[ɾʲoːhoː] 'both'\n[hʲaku] 'one hundred'\n[happʲaku] 'eight hundred'\n[sambʲaku] 'three hundred'\n[bimʲoː] 'subtle'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(The choice of transcription of these Cʲ onsets varies; some choose to use [ç] instead of [hʲ], for example.)</p>\n\n<p>There are some gaps--the alveolar stops ([t], [d]), alveolar fricatives ([s], and [z]), and the bilabial approximant [w] do not have palatalized counterparts. The [w] gap is not an unexpected one, since [w] is the only approximant (besides [j] itself). Historically, the palatalized counterparts of [t], [d], [s], and [z] became what are now the alveolo-palatal consonants [tɕ], [dʑ], [ɕ], and [ʑ], respectively. Further, these alveolo-palatal consonants do not have palatalized counterparts (there is no [ɕ]/[ɕʲ] contrast, for example).</p>\n\n<p>Due to the above facts, some consider it reasonable to adopt a synchronic analysis in which all surface occurrences of [tɕ] and [dʑ] are underlyingly /tʲ/ and /dʲ/, respectively, and all surface occurrences of [ɕ] and [ʑ] are underlyingly /sʲ/ and /tʲ/ (or even /sj/ and /tj/), respectively.</p>\n", "Id":"5907", "ParentId":"5900", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "CreationDate":"2013-11-14T15:10:07.297", "OwnerUserId":"385", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-18T16:51:06.913", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
