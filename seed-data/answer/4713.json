I'm working on a Sanskrit-Russian corpus and so I build upon <a href=\"http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=texte</a> and add Russian parallel texts.\nTEI-encoded manuscript edition is XML. I have just TXT, no markup, only corresponding shloka (=line) numbers.\n \"I added lines for the corresponding text in other languages, and manually pasted these in.\" - that does not make much sense. InterText can handle that. What languages are you working with?</p>\n", "Id":"4713", "ParentId":"1285", "CreationDate":"2013-10-12T11:51:55.797", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2584", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-12T11:51:55.797", "CommentCount":"1"}
