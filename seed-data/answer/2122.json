{"Body":"<p>At first, some general remarks on comparison and terminology. My answer is mostly based on <a href=\"http://www.unibg.it/struttura/struttura.asp?rubrica=1&amp;persona=202&amp;nome=Pierluigi&amp;cognome=Cuzzolin&amp;titolo=Prof.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pierluigi Cuzzolin</a>'s research.</p>\n\n<p>Let's start with some definition of comparison. <a href=\"http://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110172782.2/9783110172782.2.14.1212/9783110172782.2.14.1212.xml?format=EBOK&amp;rskey=myb4YA&amp;result=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cuzzolin and Lehmann 2004</a> give the following definition:</p>\n\n<p>\"Taken as a grammatical category, comparison (German Steigerung) is the formal modification of some predicative word – most often an adjective – representing a parameter of gradation\nor comparison, according to the extent to which it applies to its argument, relative to some standard\" (p. 1212).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, comparison as a grammatical category includes \"semantic\" comparison (relative) and gradation (absolute).</p>\n\n<p>Any comparison must contain at least the following three elements: the comparee, the parameter (a cognitively salient feature), and the parameter marker (a morpheme expressing a degree).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Heine has a nice table on types of comparison. Naturally, there is some variation in terminology - but this is irrelevant here.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sWEgC.png\" alt=\"Heine1997\"></p>\n\n<p>Cuzzolin and Lehmann 2004 argue that traditionally three degrees of comparison are recognized: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the positive degree;</li>\n<li>the comparative degree, which can involve comparison of majority (smarter), comparison of minority (less smart), comparison of equality (as smart as), and even sameness (known as similative);</li>\n<li>the superlative degree.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although comparison usually occurs on adjectives and adverbs, it can occur on other parts of speech, too:</p>\n\n<p>Italian <em>canzonissima</em> 'the best song'</p>\n\n<p>Basque <em>gizonago</em> 'more man'</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to remember about comparison is that it can be expressed by different means: morphologically, syntactically (for examples see Cuzzolin and Lehmann 2004).</p>\n\n<p>Now about equative expressed morphologically (like in Welsh). Cuzzolin and Lehmann argue that it's not that common. They mention the following language groups and languages: Celtic languages, Finno-Ugric languages, Kartvelian languages, Tagalog, Indonesian, Greenlandic Eskimo, and Estonian. An example from Estonian is below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P0nPw.png\" alt=\"Estonian equative\"></p>\n", "Id":"2122", "ParentId":"2093", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2012-06-16T23:57:46.883", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-17T00:12:25.573", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-17T00:12:25.573", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
