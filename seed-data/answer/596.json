{"Body":"<p>When etymology as such is covered in a linguistics curriculum, it is usually in a historical linguistics class, and I think what current research there is (not so much as there used to be, for sure) is often done by people who would consider themselves doing historical linguistics of some kind.  Much of this kind of research is now under the heading of \"semantic change\", and is more theoretically motivated than traditional \"etymology\".  I.e. the interesting questions aren't what are the histories of particular words, but rather, what explains the attested/possible patterns of semantic change.  I think there is also a certain amount of less historically oriented work on semantic change in pidgins/creoles and that kind of thing.  In general you may get the impression that it isn't part of linguistics because though it is a part of linguistics, that part is more or less outside the mainstream as represented in the USA.</p>\n\n<p>(Contra Alenanno's answer, I'm not really aware of any researchers, courses, or conferences that cover \"lexicology\" as any kind of coherent subfield in the way that the other things in that chart are.)</p>\n", "Id":"596", "ParentId":"594", "LastEditorUserId":"345", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T22:48:44.227", "OwnerUserId":"345", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-01T16:58:22.357", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cog.jhu.edu/~rawlins/", "Id":"345", "AccountId":"513980", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T22:20:39.537", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a linguist specializing in formal semantics and pragmatics.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Baltimore, MD", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"490", "DisplayName":"kgr", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-30T15:43:17.413"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-01T16:58:22.357", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cog.jhu.edu/~rawlins/", "Id":"345", "AccountId":"513980", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T22:20:39.537", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a linguist specializing in formal semantics and pragmatics.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Baltimore, MD", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"490", "DisplayName":"kgr", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-30T15:43:17.413"}}
