Both of these sounds require the tongue to be further back in the mouth than the typical pronunciation of /t/ or /d/ and so the fact that strong coarticulation results in something like the /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ affricate sounds is not actually surprising. It might not be appropriate, however, to call the resulting affricate \"palatalized\" in all cases (it may be retroflexed).</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure of a good source on the effect of bunched-r on coarticulation (as compared to other /r/ variants). It's been a while since I read it, but it might be discussed in Mielke, Jeff, Adam Baker, and Diana Archangeli's paper \"Variability and homogeneity in American English /r/ allophony and /s/ retraction\" (in LabPhon 10).</p>\n", "Id":"1776", "ParentId":"1104", "CreationDate":"2012-04-12T16:47:36.023", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"918", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-12T16:47:36.023", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"918", "AccountId":"1400893", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"31", "CreationDate":"2012-04-12T16:47:36.023", "DisplayName":"MPP", "LastAccessDate":"2012-04-12T16:47:36.023"}}
