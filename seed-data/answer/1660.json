{"Body":"<p>This is what is usually called a <strong><em>Yes/No Question</em></strong>. The rules for English Y/N Qs are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Invert subject and first auxiliary verb, add question intonation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Bill is</strong> going to the show. --> <strong>Is Bill</strong> going to the show?</em></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>If there isn't an auxiliary verb, use <strong><em>do</em></strong>, transfer the tense to <em>do</em>, and invert <strong>it</strong>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Bill went</strong> to the show --> <strong>Did Bill go</strong> to the show?</em></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>If there is a contraction with the first auxiliary verb, the whole contraction may be inverted:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Bill wasn't</strong> going to the show --> <strong>Wasn't Bill</strong> going to the show?</em></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus the negative is just a normal part of the question, in the normal place, so the grammar is nothing special. The meaning, however, is rather specialized, and there's a big literature on it in pragmatics, among other places. </p>\n\n<p>The pragmatic solution is to note that if a special word is added to a question, but the modified question asks for the same information as the unmodified one, then there must be a special conventional meaning for the added word, right? -- but it doesn't have to be obvious. Since it's a request for information either way, the negation is used to signal speaker expectation. </p>\n\n<p>And since it's <strong>not</strong> about the logical implications of the question, English speakers don't even notice the logic, and answering a negative question with a negative when you agree feels very strange to us; we're keeping our minds on the expectations, beliefs, and goals of the speaker.</p>\n\n<p>Normally English speakers use a negative Y/N Q to suggest that the positive -- <strong>not</strong> the negative -- is what they expect. Thus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Is he going to do it?</em> (no special implication, just a speaker request for information)</li>\n<li><em>Isn't he going to do it?</em> (implies speaker had expected him to do it, but now doubts)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As others have pointed out, this is not a Tag Question; Tag Qs are tags, on the end of statements. (I'm sure you understand this now, don't you? :-) They have <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/tags.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">some interesting syntax</a>, too. But the implications of positive and negative Tag Qs can be confusing when compared with those of regular Y/N Qs.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>He's going to do it, isn't he?</em> (negative tag; speaker expected positive statement)</li>\n<li><em>He's isn't going to do it, is he?</em> (positive tag; speaker expected negative statement)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These, by the way, have two different implications, depending on whether <em>is he?</em> (or <em>isn't he?</em>) has Y/N Q (rising) intonation, which is a real question, or ordinary full stop intonation (like a Wh-Q gets), which is simply a rhetorical question, stating the speaker's belief, and requires no response, though it often invites one.</p>\n", "Id":"1660", "ParentId":"1658", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2012-03-17T19:28:00.820", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-17T20:41:48.013", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
