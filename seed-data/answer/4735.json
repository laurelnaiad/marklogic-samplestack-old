As you say in your comment based on Italian Wiktionary, Italian got <em>stronzo</em> from Lombardic <em>strunz</em>. The Lombards were a Germanic tribe that invaded Italy in the 6th century and settled there, giving modern Lombardy its name; so it makes sense that they should use the Germanic word (Middle German <em>strunze</em> meant \"stront\").</p>\n\n<p>But Wiktionary also mentions Italian/Lombard <em>sterco</em>, which must come from Latin <em>stercus</em> \"dung\", related to Greek <em>skôr,</em> stem <em>skat-</em> \"dung\", as in scatological. So perhaps the Italian word is a fusion of the Germanic word and the Latin word?</p>\n\n<p>The EWN says <em>stront</em> is related to <em>stronk</em> \"tree trunk\" and Proto-Indo-European *<em>stred-</em> / *<em>stredh-</em>, which in turn may be an extension of *<em>(s)ter(h1)-</em> \"be or become stiff\". Which happens to resemble Latin <em>stercus</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"4735", "ParentId":"4734", "CreationDate":"2013-10-15T17:08:30.057", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-15T17:08:30.057", "CommentCount":"2"}
