{"Body":"<p>In a situation where you want to refer to a colour and either you don't know of any name for that colour or you know the name but you also believe your interlocutor doesn't know it - you'll instinctively resort to the evocation of an object characterised by that colour.   </p>\n\n<p>The same holds true for other senses by the way. Would you rather say for instance \"there's a smell of rotten egg\" or \"there's a smell of hydrogen sulfide\"?</p>\n\n<p>So, unless one wants to tell the policeman \"I think the light was still in the 580-620 nm range when I crossed!\", we need aliases for colours.</p>\n\n<p>As for the <em>orange</em> colour, interestingly enough, the Old English word was \"geoluread\" (PDE yellow-red, G. gelb-rot). One has to say that in those times, very few people in England had had a chance of seeing real oranges.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that oranges are quite alone in their category of orange-coloured objects added to their simple shape and the consistency of their shade probably explains why people commonly used it as a reference for the colour and that the name of the fruit became the name of the colour.</p>\n\n<p>One can only notice that the phenomenon is a widespread one, observed in many languages and suffering only a few notable albeit easily understandable exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a whirlwind tour of the various family of names for the fruit and its distinctive colour.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first family is the Anglo French <em>Orange</em> and all its cognates\n<ul>\n<li>Italian: <strong>arancia</strong> (fruit) => <strong>arancione</strong> (colour).</li>\n<li>Spanish: <strong>naranja</strong> (fruit) => <strong>naranja</strong> (colour).</li>\n<li>Portuguese: <strong>laranja</strong> (fruit) => <strong>[cor de] laranja</strong> (colour).<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>In Europe, the <em>sweet</em> orange was first grown in Portugal in the 15th century<sup><b>1</b></sup> so that the fruit has a different name all around the mediteranean:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Greek: <strong>πορτοκάλι</strong> \"portocâli\" (fruit) => <strong>πορτοκαλί</strong> (colour).</li>\n<li>Rumanian: <strong>portocală</strong> (fruit) => <strong>portocaliu</strong> (colour).</li>\n<li>Arabic: the common word (for the sweet Orange is)  برتقال, <strong>burtuqāl</strong> (the persian  نارنج, nāranğ is only used for the bitter varety).  The colour name is identical <strong>burtuqāl</strong>.</li>\n<li>Napolitan: <strong>purtuall</strong><sup><b>2</b></sup>. AFAIR the colour name is identical.</li>\n<li>Turkish: <strong>portakal</strong> but the colour is <strong>turuncu</strong> <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AC%DB%8C\">from Persian</a> <strong>nârenji</strong> (نارنجی) => The bitter variety.   </li>\n<li>Persian: <strong>porteqâl</strong> (پرتقال) (meaning <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84\">both sweet orange and Portugal</a>) and <strong>nârenji</strong> (نارنجی) meaning both the colour and the bitter variety.\n<br><br>  </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>In Chinese, the colour (chéngsè <strong>橙色</strong>, <em>lit.</em> orange-colour) is named after the fruit (chéngzi <strong>橙子</strong>, <em>lit.</em> orange+[substantive marker]).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><br>\n<strong>Exceptions</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One notable exception is the common case of many northern countries in which the fruit has two concurrent names. an older one taken from <em>Old Dutch</em> <strong>appelsien</strong><sup><b>3</b></sup>  now sinaasappel and a newer one taken from English <em>orange</em>.  In which case the colour itself is most of the time a cognate of <em>orange</em>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>German: <strong>Apfelsine</strong> (old) but still present in Apfelsinensaft. Now <strong>Orange</strong> (with Orangensaft). colour: <strong>orange</strong>.</li>\n<li>Danish and Norwegian : <strong>appelsin</strong> => Appelsinjuice; colour: <strong>Orange/Oransje</strong></li>\n<li>Icelandic: <strong>Appelsína</strong>; colour <strong>appelsínugulur</strong> (orange-yellow).</li>\n<li>more to the east: Russian: <strong>апелсин</strong>; and the colour: <strong>oранжевый</strong>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In Dominican Republic, the orange colour is actually called \"<a href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamey\">mamey</a>\" after the local fruit named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammee_apple\">Mammee</a>.  One has to mention though that they <em>do</em> have oranges over there but these are actually green.  The Mammey instead is... orange.
