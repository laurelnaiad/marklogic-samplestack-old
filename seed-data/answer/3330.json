{"Body":"<p>Every language has some tones. The question is, to which degree they are relevant to  a given language. Even Finnish language, which conventionally 'has no tones', actually marks the first stressed syllable with a falling tone, although there are no 'syntax tones', like in Russian.</p>\n\n<p>I can distinguish Russian rising or falling tones (which are important for conversational syntax) and Spanish or Italian tonic stresses, and I can distinguish both tones for Swedish lexemes (which are either falling or falling-rising), but I cannot distinguish none of two tones in Lithuanian or, say, Tibetan. All these languages have 'common' tones, that is, the tones are distiguished by a universal tone scale.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I relatively easy distinguish four tones in Mandarin, but I cannot distinguish any of three Yoruba tones, perhaps because Yoruba, like Kpelle, is a language with 'private' and not 'common' tones. </p>\n", "Id":"3330", "ParentId":"3310", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T08:24:24.993", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-08T12:36:46.133", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
