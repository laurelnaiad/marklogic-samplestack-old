{"Body":"<p>They seem morphologically complex to us because we speak an analytic language and don't notice how complex our syntax is. It seems bizarre to us to have umpty-ump different forms for every word, with lots of different paradigms and exceptions. And for gods sake, deponent verbs. Gimme a break! True. All true.</p>\n\n<p>But consider that synthetic language speakers learn all these paradigms long before they learn to write -- if they ever do; most people in the world are illiterate, after all -- and all they have to do when they learn to write is figure out how to represent what they say and what they already understand. </p>\n\n<p><strong>They</strong>, on the other hand, go nuts when they try to learn English syntax -- there are just too many thousands of constructions, each with its own short list of peculiarities, including preferred predicates, presuppositions, and pronunciations. And <strong>no</strong> (or only very few, and they only recently discovered, and still controversial) regularities that can be expressed in human or programming languages.</p>\n\n<p>Try explaining to a Finn sometime, for example, why <em>We're going shopping</em> is OK in English, while *<em>We're going eating</em> isn't; and what the difference is between this <em>go</em>+V-<em>ing</em> construction and others, like </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>go and</em>+V (<em>Let's go and help/eat</em> / <em>They went and helped/ate</em>)</li>\n<li><em>go</em>+V  (<em>Let's go help/eat</em> / *<em>They went helped/ate</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ask any teacher of English as a non-native language. English is syntactically complex. That's the tradeoff you usually find between an analytic language like English -- where syntax does most of the grammatical work -- and a synthetic one like PIE -- where morphology does the heavy lifting. When you have more of one, you need and use less of the other; but when things change in the one, there's always the other to use instead.</p>\n", "Id":"1015", "ParentId":"315", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2011-11-12T01:30:22.463", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-16T04:25:21.123", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
