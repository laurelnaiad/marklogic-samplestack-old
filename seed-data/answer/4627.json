{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This happens with all Greek words in r- when a prefix is added, not just that particular word.</p>\n\n<p>A likely explanation (though I don't have a reference for this) is that the sound written as Greek initial ῥ- was a long trill [rr], just like initial r- in Spanish. (The fact that ῥ- always comes from a cluster, *sr- or *wr-, makes this plausible.) Therefore when a prefix was added you need a way to distinguish this in spelling from single [r], leading to the spelling -ρρ- (or -ῤῥ- as it's usually written).</p>\n", "Id":"4627", "ParentId":"3685", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T03:42:48.183", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-07T03:42:48.183", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
