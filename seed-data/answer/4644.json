{"Body":"<p>Pretty late, but anyway:</p>\n\n<p>It is generally assumed, that originally Afroasiatic languages had and many of them still have biradical roots [see e.g. <a href=\"http://books.google.de/books?id=SMzgBLT87MkC&amp;pg=PA27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolff</a>, <a href=\"http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/jud/histhebl.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kutscher: p. 6</a>, Militarev (link on demand - I don't have enough points) and others]. \"Final consonants of verb roots (“determinants” in Semitic linguistic terminology) appear to semantically modify the root\" (from Wolff). This can be exemplified by cognates of Semitic triradicals and \"Hamitic\" biradicals as well as comparison of triradicals within the Semitic itself with very similar meanings, but differing by a single consonant [although it is very difficult to prove that such forms actually do stem from the same biradical root].</p>\n\n<p>Here is one series of Hebrew roots, provided by Kutscher as an example of the intra-Semitic evidence of the original bi-radicalism:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>‫' פרד‬divide'</li>\n<li>‫' פרט‬change’</li>\n<li>‫ פרך‬, פרר‬'crumble’</li>\n<li>‫' פרם‬tear'</li>\n<li>‫' פרס‬divide in two'</li>\n<li>‫' פרק‬tear apart'</li>\n<li>‫פרץ‬ 'break through'</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is not to say that שבע and שבת are cognates [and I couldn't find relevant information concerning this relationship], but one couldn't rule it out basing on tri-consonantism of most of the Hebrew roots. However the meanings are pretty much different: שבע designates \"seven\" in Semitic languages and שבת is \"rest\", from which the noun שבת for Sabbath is derived.</p>\n", "Id":"4644", "ParentId":"3220", "LastEditorUserId":"2558", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T19:54:53.580", "OwnerUserId":"2558", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-07T21:06:07.337", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"2", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2558", "AccountId":"2628933", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"195", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T18:51:06.047", "DisplayName":"har-wradim", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T20:29:57.133"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-07T21:06:07.337", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"2", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2558", "AccountId":"2628933", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"195", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T18:51:06.047", "DisplayName":"har-wradim", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T20:29:57.133"}}
