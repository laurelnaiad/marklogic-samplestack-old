{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I ended up saying in my paper that there are two aspects: distributive and durative. I think distributive is a decent term for things like <em>I've met a lot of weird people over the years</em>. Durative is meant for expressions like <em>Production has doubled over the past three months</em>. Not sure if that is any different than <em>in the last three months</em>. Also not entirely sure if I like durative, but oh well.</p>\n", "Id":"6087", "ParentId":"5999", "CreationDate":"2013-12-07T16:49:53.167", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2373", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-07T16:49:53.167", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2373", "AccountId":"139820", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"196", "CreationDate":"2013-08-16T17:48:57.747", "DisplayName":"Moss", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-18T02:51:26.983"}}
