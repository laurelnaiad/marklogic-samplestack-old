{"Body":"<p>Take a look at the first eleven tables in <a href=\"http://www.nostratic.ru/books/%28211%29vajda-2008.pdf\">A Siberian Link with Na-Dene Languages</a>, which show the order of constituents in a verbal complex.</p>\n\n<p>Included are various Dene-Yeniseian languages as well as Sumerian, Burushaski, Abkhaz, and Ha (a Bantu language).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it's very hard to test your hypothetical order against them, since TAM (tense/aspect/mood markers) tend to be clumped together--and sometimes repeated throughout the complex!--whereas negation is only marked in Burushaski, and it's not on the same side as the other relevant markers; and voice doesn't seem to be marked in any of them.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to suggest that perhaps causative markers (and possibly stative resultative markers, although the evidence is really from one family) are often very close to the root.</p>\n", "Id":"453", "ParentId":"365", "LastEditorUserId":"84", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T13:05:49.583", "OwnerUserId":"84", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-23T16:28:17.213", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"167", "WebsiteUrl":"http://web.mit.edu/~dbriggs/www", "Id":"84", "AccountId":"511555", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:18:36.197", "AboutMe":"<p>At UMass Amherst in the Ph.D. program in math.<br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently taking:<br>\nAnalysis (Measure theory & integration)<br>\nGeometry (Theory of manifolds)<br>\nModular Forms</p>\n", "Age":"29", "Location":"Cambridge, MA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1163", "DisplayName":"Daniel Briggs", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-10T16:57:15.060"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-23T16:28:17.213", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"167", "WebsiteUrl":"http://web.mit.edu/~dbriggs/www", "Id":"84", "AccountId":"511555", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:18:36.197", "AboutMe":"<p>At UMass Amherst in the Ph.D. program in math.<br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently taking:<br>\nAnalysis (Measure theory & integration)<br>\nGeometry (Theory of manifolds)<br>\nModular Forms</p>\n", "Age":"29", "Location":"Cambridge, MA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1163", "DisplayName":"Daniel Briggs", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-10T16:57:15.060"}}
