{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Another example of the same combination of gnarly syllable structure and tone is Tlingit, where words like [tʃχánkʼ] ‘grandkid’ and [ɬʔùɬ.tʃí.nì] ‘vest’ occur. Tone provably arose in this language from breathy and glottalized vowels without any change in syllable codas based on the extinct Tongass Tlingit dialect’s non-tonal vowel system. So it’s not the case that tone <i>must</i> evolve with simple syllabic structure.</p>\n\n<p>There may be something to the idea that <i>contour</i> tone cooccurrs with simple syllabic structure, but even then Tlingit provides a counterexample. The Southern Tlingit dialect has a falling tone, a contour tone going from high to low. It predictably occurs in two situations: *Vˀ > V̂ː and *VːR > V̂ːR where R is a sonorant ∈ {/n/, /j/, /w/, /ɰ/}. I think that there are also some Athabaskan languages with complex syllable structure and contour tone, perhaps Southern Tutchone or Tanacross.</p>\n", "Id":"1087", "ParentId":"702", "CreationDate":"2011-11-28T20:59:09.287", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"511", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-28T20:59:09.287", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"30", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.drangle.com/~james", "Id":"511", "AccountId":"513739", "CreationDate":"2011-11-16T02:03:12.387", "AboutMe":"<p>I’m a PhD student in linguistics at the University of British Columbia. I work on Tlingit, a critically endangered language of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and southeast Alaska. I also have extensive interests in the related Athabaskan languages, language documentation theory and practice, orthography design, morphological theory, phonological theory, and the syntax of noun phrases and relativization.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using TeX and friends for more than a decade. I use Xe(La)TeX, fontspec, memoir, and BibLaTeX extensively, and I am working on a BibLaTeX style for linguistics publications. Other packages I use frequently include pst-jtree, expex, and booktabs. I’m learning PGF/TikZ and considering developing a library to produce autosegmental representation diagrams. I do my writing in TeXShop, and my TeX programming in MacVim, having abandoned FSF Emacs and XEmacs due to their perpetually disappointing Unicode rendering.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"5", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"866", "DisplayName":"James C.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-03T19:13:48.097"}}
