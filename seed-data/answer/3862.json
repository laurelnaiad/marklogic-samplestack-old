{"Body":"<p>Most text books focus on single consonant onsets (called simplex onsets) so dealing with a complex onset like /st/ can be confusing.</p>\n\n<p>If you take a look at section 2 in <a href=\"http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~topintzi/papers/companion_onsets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this overview of moraic theory</a>, you can see that complex onsets do it in one of two ways: the either treat the complex onset as two separate consonants or they say that the features of the consonants linearize, for lack of a better word, and effectively turn into a single consonant. Either way the result seems to be that a complex onset does not take significantly more time than a simplex onset and thus does need any extra moras.</p>\n\n<p>However, You should also be aware of <em>superheavy syllables</em>, defined in the Wikipedia article for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_weight\" rel=\"nofollow\">syllable weight</a>. These are syllables with two V segments (a long vowel or a diphthong) plus a coda or a single V and two C segments in the coda for a total of three moras per syllable. Superheavy syllables don't appear in every language but I believe they do in English. So the question is whether the vowel in \"steak\" is a diphthong. For me it isn't but you seem to think it is.</p>\n", "Id":"3862", "ParentId":"3860", "LastEditorUserId":"1055", "CreationDate":"2013-06-16T01:04:19.723", "OwnerUserId":"1055", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-16T01:10:20.783", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"102", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Seoul, South Korea", "Id":"1055", "DownVotes":"9", "AccountId":"1453460", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"1947", "CreationDate":"2012-05-29T05:50:57.073", "DisplayName":"acattle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:59:41.983", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently studying for an MA in Computational Linguistics even though my background is not in linguistics.
