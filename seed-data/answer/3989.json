Certain languages might find certain ideas easier to convey than others (for reasons ranging from 'having a grammatical structure that's convenient for that' to 'having a large and developed technical vocabulary for that field'), but you can say anything in any language, even if you have to resort to loanwords / on-the-spot coinings or convoluted sentence structures.</p>\n\n<p>You might be able to rate languages on how easily they can express certain individual concepts (for example, a number of languages in the Amazon would rate very high on a scale of how easy it is to note where information was obtained from; Korean and Javanese (yes, with a v) would rate high on a scale of how easy it is to reference social hierarchy, etc); but it mostly evens out on average - few, if any, languages struggle more than others on the whole.\n(And really, most of the difficulty that comes with conveying complicated information is due to just not having the words, a problem that is -very- easily solvable!)</p>\n", "Id":"3989", "ParentId":"3987", "CreationDate":"2013-07-10T15:59:33.473", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-10T15:59:33.473", "CommentCount":"3"}
