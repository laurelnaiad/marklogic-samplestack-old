{"Body":"<p>ğ is a symbol used in writing Turkish. When word or syllable final, it indicates a preceding back vowel is lengthened and is typically silent otherwise. In some dialects it may be realized as a velar (or uvular) approximant, fricative or plosive. A velar approximant is an acceptable pronunciation in standard Istanbul dialect too, but it's becoming increasingly rare. Following a front vowel it may manifest as a palatal glide.</p>\n\n<p>So  \"aa\" and \"ağ\" are identical. When intervocalic, the preceding and following vowels belong to different syllables, meaning that \"ağa\" is a long syllable-final vowel followed by a syllable-initial vowel (so Turkish does not have a three-way length contrast). I don't know \"â\"??</p>\n\n<p>There are some other complexities, discussed in the pdf <a href=\"http://www.turuz.info/Dil/0212-Turkish%20comprehensive%20grammar.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (pp 7-8).</p>\n", "Id":"766", "ParentId":"373", "LastEditorUserId":"805", "CreationDate":"2011-10-11T00:40:04.587", "OwnerUserId":"363", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-06T10:38:36.940", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"20", "Location":"Istanbul, Turkey", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"805", "AccountId":"538434", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"347", "CreationDate":"2012-02-29T19:39:29.067", "DisplayName":"cyco130", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T03:11:01.960", "AboutMe":"<p>Musician, amateur programmer and amateur linguist.
