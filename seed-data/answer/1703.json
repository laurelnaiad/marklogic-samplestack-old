For most verbs simple aspect is a single movement; this changes to a continuous circling motion for progressive aspect. There are a zillion others. </p>\n\n<p>It can't be even produced on its own, let alone make sense; it can be used with any noun; modifies the morphological function of the word by changing the aspect part of a {verb+aspect} bimorphemic word; does not modify the semantics of the verb part. </p>\n\n<p>Testing it against the criteria in jlawler's link, above:\n1. It does not change the part of speech; it stays a verb\n3. It affects every verb productively\n2&amp; 4. That circular motion isolated by itself is an exact equivalent to the English -ing morpheme, so it relates to the same semantics outside the word, and plays the same role in the tense/aspect system as the English counterpart. \n5. doesn't apply as all this stuff happens simultaneously.   </p>\n\n<p>Excellent descriptions are given in:</p>\n\n<p>Klima, Edward S., and Ursula Bellugi. 1979.
