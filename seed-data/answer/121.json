I plan eventually to go to graduate school for foreign language education, to become certified to teach Japanese at the secondary level.</p>\n\n<p>In the mean time, however, I program (primarily in PHP and SQL). I also recently began working as a freelance Japanese-to-English translator, though I've translated anime and manga as a hobby in the past.</p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Pittsburgh, PA", "DownVotes":"3", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"486", "DisplayName":"rintaun", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-04T21:12:24.253"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>Just speaking from anecdotal evidence and personal experience, I have a friend who grew up in a 100% German-speaking environment, but who seems to have acquired English from American children's cartoons.
