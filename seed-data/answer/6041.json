{"Body":"<p>From Whitney's <em>Sanskrit Grammar</em> (p. 20):</p>\n\n<p>\"...as the original <em>w</em> has in most European languages been changed to <em>v</em>, so also in India, and that from a very early time: the Paninean scheme and two of the Prātiçākhyas (VPr. and TPr.) distinctly define the sound as made between the upper teeth and the lower lip -- which, of course, identifies it with the modern <em>v</em>-sound.\"</p>\n\n<p>As hippietrail points out in comments, though, this could just as easily describe a labiodental approximant [ʋ] as a labiodental fricative [v]. W. S. Allen's <em>Phonetics in Ancient India</em> (which I don't have at hand) is sure to have more information on how the grammarians described this sound.</p>\n", "Id":"6041", "ParentId":"6039", "LastEditorUserId":"2411", "CreationDate":"2013-11-30T21:37:53.493", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-01T17:31:14.060", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-01T17:31:14.060", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
