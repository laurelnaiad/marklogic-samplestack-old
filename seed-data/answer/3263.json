This is the way syllable templates are discussed in phonology texts. Brackets are used for phonetic transcription, so <code>[v]</code> refers to the particular consonant called voiced labiodental fricative. Perhaps you could use something like <code>b(V)(C)</code> or <code>bVC</code>, but of course you should explain your notation clearly.</p>\n", "Id":"3263", "ParentId":"3256", "CreationDate":"2013-02-23T13:16:19.237", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-23T13:16:19.237", "CommentCount":"6"}
