{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Yes, but not how you are defining it.  Linguistic analysis is the analysis of language usually in three areas. Those are syntax, phonetics, and semantics. Syntax is the study of language structure , phonetics is the study of language sounds, and semantics is the study of language meaning.  This is a bit simplified but works for the purposes of this question.  I primarily studied Syntax in Grad school, but took a little bit of these three as well.  I am dubious of any claim of honesty or dishonesty based on \"linguistic analysis\" and would go so far to say it is not linguistic analysis at all. A good place to start looking is  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics</a> which gives a good overview of linguistics.  As far as a court goes forensic linguistics usually for written statements is usually dealing with authorship.  How likely did X write Y.  Also in contract disputes to determine what the most likely meaning of a particular phrase was especially if the contract is older and language usage has changed. I think honesty vs dishonesty would tricky to determine in court due to the variability of language between people which is similar to the reason lie detectors cannot be used too much variability.</p>\n", "Id":"3342", "ParentId":"3338", "CreationDate":"2013-03-09T08:50:46.740", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1842", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-09T08:50:46.740", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1842", "AccountId":"2468621", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-03-09T08:50:46.740", "DisplayName":"Brian Nisonger", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-10T07:27:01.630"}}
