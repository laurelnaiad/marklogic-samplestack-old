{"OwnerDisplayName":"Yirmeyahu", "Body":"<p>I'm not sure that Aleph or Seraph are good examples of Hebrew words \"transliterated\" into English, rather they are words which migrated into English from Hebrew. While these words may be pronounced more or less similar to the Hebrew counterpart they are more along the lines of words such as Josph. Such words are going to reflect nuances of the intermediary languages which they have passed through.</p>\n\n<p>Transliterated words, those not at all part of the English language (or only recognized by select sub-groups such as those who frequent websites dedicated to the English language discussion of Judaic topics :) ) are probably much less likely to employ ph over f than words which migrated into English. Nevertheless when ph is employed it may often be due to the influence of migrated words (Joseph makes Yoseph more useful than it would be otherwise) directly or indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>While I don't think there is an easy answer to why people choose ph of f (when they do) since we cannot read each individuals mind or account for style or other less concrete factors, Ph does have a small advantage over F insofar as it somewhat preserves the shared identity of peh and pheh in Hebrew (פ). This can be particularly useful when trying to illustrate the common root of two words where the pronunciation of the פ has shifted.</p>\n", "Id":"2295", "ParentId":"2292", "CreationDate":"2010-04-09T05:38:53.347", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2010-04-09T05:38:53.347", "comments":[]}
