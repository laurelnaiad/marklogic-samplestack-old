{"Body":"<p>According to Merriam-Webster online, a sentence is ``A set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation,...'' In that sense I think we could say yes. </p>\n\n<p>The orthography of certain languages may not have spaces or punctuation marks but, just as all human languages have breaks between sounds, they also have breaks between thoughts. If you mean some requirement to do with predicates or subject or objects, perhaps there is a language that almost always omits one of them (I studied applied linguistics and saw many odd examples along the way). In what sense do you mean 'sentence' (as jlawler said)?</p>\n", "Id":"3279", "ParentId":"3270", "LastEditorUserId":"1702", "CreationDate":"2013-02-25T21:14:32.057", "OwnerUserId":"1702", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-05T19:16:33.833", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Asheville, NC", "Id":"1702", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"50693", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"208", "CreationDate":"2013-01-26T00:57:46.493", "DisplayName":"sventechie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-25T15:32:04.323", "AboutMe":"<p>linguist, programmer in Perl, Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, various XML -- former sysadmin</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-05T19:16:33.833", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Asheville, NC", "Id":"1702", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"50693", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"208", "CreationDate":"2013-01-26T00:57:46.493", "DisplayName":"sventechie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-25T15:32:04.323", "AboutMe":"<p>linguist, programmer in Perl, Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, various XML -- former sysadmin</p>\n"}}
