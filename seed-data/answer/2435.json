{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>A big thing is that gender is frequently lexical. That is, a noun is a certain gender, and it's ungrammatical to use the wrong one. Classifiers frequently don't work that way. For instance, you could use a \"flat round thing\" classifier in Chinese with a sunflower if you're focussing on the petals, or you might use \"tall skinny thing\" if you're referring to the whole thing, stalk included. I can't remember the references talking about this point, but it's generally true.</p>\n\n<p>Also, classifiers are almost always used in particular kinds of syntactic contexts. Normally with numerals, and sometimes with determiners. </p>\n", "Id":"2435", "ParentId":"1921", "CreationDate":"2012-08-17T22:30:06.513", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"438", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-17T22:30:06.513", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ohhai.mn", "Id":"438", "AccountId":"985599", "CreationDate":"2011-10-19T23:00:39.300", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Maryland, studying Linguistics. I work in (morpho)syntax, and dabble in semantics and psycholinguistics. My research interests are in the structure and interpretation of the noun phrase from a crosslinguistic perspective, the structure of Bengali and Indo-Aryan, the representation of argument and event structure, and constraints on variation in grammar and parsing.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of Linguistics I'm interested in religion and atheism, issues related to social justice (particularly for religious and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities), new(-ish) media (internet culture, comic books, video games, various electronics), and various aspects of nerd culture.
