With (1) you can see what sound changes have taken place (beyond simple loan adaptation) since the borrowing; (2) gives you an indication of the phonological form of a native word at a prehistoric point, and thus an idea of what scs have occurred since; (3) allows you to use the comparative method--just with rather limited data.</p>\n", "Id":"2355", "ParentId":"1837", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T07:50:41.847", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1227", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-05T07:50:41.847", "CommentCount":"1"}
