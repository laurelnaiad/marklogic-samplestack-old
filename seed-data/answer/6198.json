{"Body":"<p>The contact of Slavs with the Celtic people was very long ago, in the 4th - 2nd centuries BC, in the times when the Proto-Slavic language still existed, the few Slavic words that can be explained by that contact were borrowed into the Ptoto-Slavic. Because of this, it looks quite improbable that the long Celtic <code>á</code> of <strong>bár</strong> would give the Slavic <code>o</code> of <code>болꙗринъ</code> which was a short vowel in those times. <code>Болꙗринъ</code> is the original form of <code>барин</code> since the latter was attested much later. Besides, Slavs didn't have aristocracy BC, so the word couldn't appear that early.</p>\n\n<p>All the attempts to explain that word by Celtic influence break against the laws of phonetics.</p>\n", "Id":"6198", "ParentId":"6191", "LastEditorUserId":"2689", "CreationDate":"2013-12-19T23:05:10.643", "OwnerUserId":"2689", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-20T00:19:05.197", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "Location":"Ukraine", "DownVotes":"12", "Id":"2689", "AccountId":"2118122", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"828", "CreationDate":"2013-11-06T08:33:33.413", "DisplayName":"Yellow Sky", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:45:10.363", "AboutMe":"<p>I've been working as a teacher of English and German for more than 10 years already.
