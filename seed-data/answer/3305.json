You have a neutral description, e.g., <em>disabled.</em> Then a minority of people starts to dislike this term for some reason (e.g., since it is also used as an insult) and replaces it by some word they consider to be better, e.g., <em>differently abled.</em> This minority has an impact on society, not only popularizing the new term but also moving the public reception of the old term from a neutral to a more negative one. Finally the old term is generally considered to be disrespective and insulting and the new one is considered neutral and preferable. (And then people start all over again.)</p></li>\n<li><p>In almost every language you will find speakers who oppose loanwords and use neologisms (or existing words) instead. For example, though the vast majority of Germans uses <em>Internet</em> for the internet, there is a small radical minority, which (unsuccessfully) propagates the use of <em>Weltnetz</em> (world network) or similar terms instead. There are also successful examples of replacing a loanword, e.g., some of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_von_Zesen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phillip von Zesenâ€™s</a> creations.</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"3305", "ParentId":"3303", "CreationDate":"2013-03-03T10:32:07.300", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1822", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-03T10:32:07.300", "CommentCount":"3"}
