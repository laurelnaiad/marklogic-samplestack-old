{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There's a pretty good, concise summary of version vowels (referred to as \"preradical vowels\" in Aronson's terminology) in Lesson 13 of Aronson, <em>Georgian: A Reading Grammar</em>.  I'm assuming you already have a copy (if you don't, it is available to download for free from the Duke University website), so I won't paraphrase what is mentioned there.</p>\n\n<p>As for ეტარებინა, it is indeed the 3 p.s. pluperfect of ატარებს.  It is formed regularly.  So for the I and III conjugations, you basically use the aorist, with inversion.  The subject is marked with the OBJECT prefixes plus ე and the object is marked with the normal aorist screeve endings for the SUBJECT, with an intrusive ვ for third person subjects with first person objects.  </p>\n\n<p>So, for example, ვნახავ (fut) > ვნახე (aor) > მენახა (ppf - note the inversion: it looks like there should be a 3 p.s. subject, but the ე version vowel shows us that it's pluperfect, so the ending is reinterpreted as a 3 p.s. OBJECT); გნახავ (fut) > გნახე (aor) > მენახე (ppf - again, look at the screeve ending - this is what happens with non-3 p. OBJECTS); ნახავს (fut) > ნახა (aor) > ენახა (ppf); მნახავს (fut) > მნახა (aor) > ვენახე (ppf - here is an example of the \"intrusive ვ\" - it has to appear because otherwise ენახე would be ambiguous).</p>\n\n<p>The only slight complication with ეტარებინა is the -ინ-, but this is infixed in the pluperfect of (all???) denominal verbs in ა-...-ებ.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried to be as brief as possible without sacrificing clarity.  I hope I have succeeded!</p>\n", "Id":"3830", "ParentId":"3785", "CreationDate":"2013-06-08T14:42:35.023", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2104", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-08T14:42:35.023", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2104", "AccountId":"2818521", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"166", "CreationDate":"2013-05-26T18:41:51.217", "DisplayName":"A Parmar", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-16T21:55:16.307"}}
