The folk etymologies are interesting enough, why not just leave them be?</p>\n\n<p>The pronunciation of the Vietnamese and Lao words are very close if not identical - /fɤ:/.  The Vietnamese tone is a ‘dipping’ tone that drops and then rises, at least in citation form (Thompson’s description).  The Lao tone rises from a low beginning, so it seems to be quite similar to its Vietnamese counterpart.  There is no equivalent word in Thai (although you might see some version of it on the menus of restaurants serving the Vietnamese dish.)  This suggests that Lao has borrowed the Vietnamese word.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t see how 粉 would tie in here.  It means flour or powder, and there is a final –n that doesn’t fit.  There might conceivably be a connection with another word for Vietnamese rice noodles, bún (as in the dish bún cha).  </p>\n\n<p>While we’re on the subject of Southeast Asian noodle dishes and etymology, Thai has a dish called ขนมจีน /kʰənom tɕi:n/ which consists of boiled rice noodles, fresh vegetables and herbs, all mixed together and topped with a curry sauce.  The name appears to mean “Chinese dessert”, but it was actually borrowed from the Mon word for “to boil”.  The proximate source would have been Mon refugees from Burmese wars who settled in Bangkok and central Thailand during the 18th century.</p>\n", "Id":"6430", "ParentId":"4583", "CreationDate":"2014-01-16T17:15:05.940", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2619", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-16T17:15:05.940", "CommentCount":"3"}
