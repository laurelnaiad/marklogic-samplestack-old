In other words, I assert the coherence of a pragmatics that\n  is defined as inference, while rejecting as incoherent the older\n  approach to defining the field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2588", "ParentId":"2571", "CreationDate":"2012-09-21T13:19:16.430", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-21T13:19:16.430", "CommentCount":"1"}
