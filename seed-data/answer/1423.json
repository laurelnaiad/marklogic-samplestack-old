{"Body":"<p>I think Japanese (and maybe some other languages) might be special in this case. Japanese uses personal pronouns much less than e.g. English, and second person pronouns are in many cases completely avoided.</p>\n\n<p>When speaking to kids, parents will usually refer to themselves as ママ mama／パパ papa or お母さん okāsan／お父さん otōsan, i.e. Mommy/Daddy or Mother/Father. When referring to the child, they will say <em>child's name</em>+君 kun/ちゃん chan (honorific suffixes), or sometimes a nickname which might or might not have the honorific suffix \"built in\". Personal pronouns are hardly ever used.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, the reversal errors do not occur in their usual form. However, different but related problems occur:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The child has to learn to remove the honorific suffix when referring to themselves.</li>\n<li>Even without the honorific suffix, referring yourself by name is considered childish. Children have to learn to use a first person pronoun when referring to themselves.</li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"1423", "ParentId":"210", "LastEditorUserId":"724", "CreationDate":"2012-02-14T13:34:35.453", "OwnerUserId":"724", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-08T11:17:05.510", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-08T11:17:05.510", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}}
