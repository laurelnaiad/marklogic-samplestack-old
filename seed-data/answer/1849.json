It started just in Spain, then spread to many parts of the world.  This happened because the Spanish conquered other groups (like the Aztecs) and imposed their language and because their population grew in the new territories and they raised their children in a Spanish-speaking environment.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's look at Welsh.  It was once more widely spoken in and around Wales, but is now much reduced in number of speakers.  Many people who once spoke Welsh now speak English in their daily lives and don't teach Welsh to their children.</p>\n\n<p>The number of people who speak a language depends on the rise and fall of the community that speaks that language.</p>\n", "Id":"1849", "ParentId":"1847", "CreationDate":"2012-04-27T22:52:42.393", "Score":"11", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"314", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-27T22:52:42.393", "CommentCount":"2"}
