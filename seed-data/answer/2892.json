{"Body":"<p>A descriptive statement is a fairly abstract structure, pragmatically speaking, and as such seems likely to have appeared as a type quite late in human language evolution. Obviously it did not spring into existence full-blown. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, there was probably quite a lot of pre-evolution involved, but we don't have nearly enough data about what really happened to do more than speculate about the relative evolutionary advantages of speech act types.</p>\n\n<p>It is instructive, however, that mathematics, logic, and philosophy (and for that matter, science and theology) have seized on the descriptive statement as the communicational vehicle of choice. Descriptive statements have a lot of convenient features.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They can be independently verified</li>\n<li>They have a recognizable structure</li>\n<li>They are -- in priniciple, at least -- independent of intentions, presuppositions, or emotions</li>\n<li>They have modes of expression for Quantification, Negation, and Modality (the 3 logical Operators)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But the fact is that descriptive statements are by far less common in real language than are isolated words or phrases, fragments of idioms and conversational formulae, and simple sub-morphemic intonation contours (i.e, grunts, including the various versions of \"Oh\", \"Ah\", \"Eh?). </p>\n\n<p>Mostly people talk in phrases, not clauses. Sentence-level and paragraph-level consistency in structure and focus is the exception, not the rule -- at least for those educated in Anglophone schools, where such consistency is famously uncultivated.</p>\n\n<p>So the evolutionary reasons for preferring descriptive statements in some contexts are probably still the reasons for using them in those contexts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AFTERTHOUGHT</strong>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Descriptive statements also pair up well as responses to <em>Wh</em>-questions (as they are called in Anglocentric syntactic theories), which are pretty obviously elaborations of natural expressions of puzzlement and anxiety -- so natural that there are characteristic facial expressions and intonations for expressing those emotions, and requesting information about their source, that are pan-H.sapiens.</p>\n  \n  <p>So whatever the force(s) and source(s) involved, the evolution of descriptive statements can't be divorced from the evolution of questions; they're a natural pair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2892", "ParentId":"2887", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2012-11-24T18:23:39.413", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-25T19:13:33.297", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
