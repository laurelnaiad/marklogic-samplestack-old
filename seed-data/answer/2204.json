After sufficient exposure I gave more attention to the speech and not the text, and you begin to 'draw lines', as you say, between your native language and the one you are trying to learn.</p>\n\n<p>Playing games also proved useful, although a lot harder. It was basically blindly trying, and trying to understand the effect my actions had on the game. As a small child at the time, playing Pokemon can be quite the challenge when you do not speak the language. Another problem I've struggled with is words that I've only read. RETRY was a word I read as Rettry, basically just because I was eleven at the time, and I still pronounce it that way, if I'm not aware of what I'm about to say.</p>\n\n<p>This is all based on personal experience, and I wish you all the best in learning Norwegian.\nOr; Lykke til med spr√•ket !</p>\n", "Id":"2204", "ParentId":"1792", "CreationDate":"2012-07-04T01:02:52.313", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1158", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-04T01:02:52.313", "CommentCount":"1"}
