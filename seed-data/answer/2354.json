On the other hand, English exhibits <em>satellite-framing</em> behaviour, since for many verbs, the same kind of information (motion from where? to where?) is encoded in particles which \"orbit\" the verb. It's true that neither is English entirely satellite-framing (through its Romance-derived verbal lexicon), nor Italian entirely verb-framing (with <em>giù</em> and <em>sù</em>).</p>\n\n<p>As for the diachronic reasons, I think that all the Romance languages are largely verb-framing because Latin was strongly verb-framing (its rich set of preposition-like prefixes including <em>ob-</em>, <em>ab-</em>, <em>trans-</em>, <em>sub-</em> serving the same purpose as verb particles like <em>against</em>, <em>across</em>, <em>under</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Harbour's answer has an important point, though. The verbs which he calls \"<em>look up</em> type verbs\" are instances of the English verb particle construction, which yields the verb/satellite-framing variation previously discussed. The \"<em>look for</em> type verbs\" are typically analysed as verbs which subcategorise for a PP (prepositional phrase), which explains why they cleave tight to the verb.</p>\n", "Id":"2354", "ParentId":"2349", "CreationDate":"2012-08-05T02:30:22.067", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"746", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-05T02:30:22.067", "CommentCount":"3"}
