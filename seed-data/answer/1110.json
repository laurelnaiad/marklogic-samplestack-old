But maybe that's how I <em>should</em> feel. :)</p>\n\n<p>I'm a big believer in the idea that just a little technical skill can be very useful for people in many fields. So I spend a fair amount of time trying to explain things like HTML and CSS and perhaps a little Python or something to other people. </p>\n\n<p>If anyone out there is interested in working on open source projects for linguistics, please get in touch.</p>\n\n<p>I have a Github account but it's a bewildering pile of crap right now, I'll try to get around to cleaning that up and then I'll post it here.</p>\n"}}
