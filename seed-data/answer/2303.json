{"OwnerDisplayName":"Dima", "Body":"<p>In the audio <a href=\"http://www.teach12.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=350\" rel=\"nofollow\">course</a> on the History of Ancient Egypt, professor Bob Brier mentions the similarity between the name Moses and the names of Egyptian pharaohs like Ramses or Thutmose. In ancient Egyptian \"mes\" is the word for \"son\", and \"mesu\" means \"to be born\".  So \"Ramses\" means \"the son of Ra\" or \"Ra is born\", and \"Thutmose\" means \"the son of Thoth\" or \"Thoth is born\".  Bob Brier argues that since Moshe was born in Egypt and raised as a member of the Egyptian royal household, his name may well be Egyptian in origin.</p>\n", "Id":"2303", "ParentId":"2299", "CreationDate":"2010-12-15T17:07:00.487", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2010-12-15T17:07:00.487", "CommentCount":"7", "comments":[]}
