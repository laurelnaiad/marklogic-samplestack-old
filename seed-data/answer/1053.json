{"Body":"<p>Sexism is in general not reflected in language. Rather, changing standards about what is considered sexist are reflected in the metalinguistic discourse of commentators on gender issues. I do not know of any literature on this topic (metalinguistic discourse about sexism), but it seems like a very interesting one and I would be happy to learn that I was mistaken about its non-existence. For scholarship about how gender and sexuality are reflected in sociolinguistic variation, and about the study of gender and language in general, you might start with works by <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~eckert/gender.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penelope Eckert</a>. I suppose it is possible that some sociolinguistic variables identifiable with subcommunities of people who are openly sexist could in principle be identified.</p>\n\n<p>A simple approach might be to use the Oxford English Dictionary, which has detailed word histories. </p>\n", "Id":"1053", "ParentId":"1052", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T22:51:39.693", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-20T00:00:51.317", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-20T00:00:51.317", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
