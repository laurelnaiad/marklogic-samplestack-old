{"Body":"<p>From the description of your task, I get the impression that you do not really need semantics of any kind &mdash; you intend to discard many segments of a sentence. I believe that you'd be better off looking at <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046410001577\" rel=\"nofollow\">the chunkers listed here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Chunkers have differing performance levels for noun phrases and verb phrases. You could start with the ones that perform better with verb phrases. You could also try to play with <a href=\"http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch07.html#chap-chunk\" rel=\"nofollow\">NLTK's chunker</a>. You'd have to define your own patterns for NLTK's chunker.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't worked with any of these tools, myself. So I can't tell you which ones require you to write software. I understand that you are a student of marketing. I don't know how comfortable you'd be with writing code. But if you have to write code, I think writing Python (for NLTK) should be less of a hair-pulling experience for you, than writing Java for one of the Java-based tools could be.</p>\n", "Id":"2972", "ParentId":"2962", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2012-12-14T00:39:26.020", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-14T01:10:31.767", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-14T01:10:31.767", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
