{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>User <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/610/beatrix\">Beatrix</a> had posted an answer that has been deleted. It contained some useful information that I will summarize here.</p>\n\n<p>Beatrix suggested that some consider the use of <em>ter que</em> without a direct object to <em>ter</em>, as in my Question above, to be bad style (although others disagree). There is <a href=\"http://www.brasilescola.com/gramatica/ter-que-ou-ter-de.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">the idea</a> that <em>tenho de</em> is used to express \"I have to [verb]\", while <em>tenho [noun] que</em> is used with a direct object to mean \"I have [something] to [verb]\". It would then be recommended that <em>ter de</em> be used when <em>ter</em> does have a direct object, while <em>ter que</em> is to be used when there is such a direct object, because <em>que</em> is a relative pronoun that refers to an antecedent.</p>\n\n<p>If we assume that this idea comes from somewhere, leaving aside stylistic issues, it supports the hypothesis that <em>ter que</em> with no direct object to <em>ter</em> developed from the older <em>ter [object] que</em>, as suggested by Lovegren above.</p>\n", "Id":"2121", "ParentId":"1522", "CreationDate":"2012-06-16T23:42:40.897", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-16T23:42:40.897", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
