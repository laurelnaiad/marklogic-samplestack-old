First /u:/ became /ju:/, then the /j/ modified the consonant before it, i.e. <em>d</em> in <em>duke</em> and <em>T</em> in <em>Tuesday</em>. There is some evidence, at least, that the introduction of /j/ is a recent phenomenon. Guy Deutscher (in <em>The Unfolding of Language</em>, page 52) quotes Charles Eastlake in 1902 saying that those born around 1800 said \"Dook\" for <em>Duke</em> and \"Toosday\" for <em>Tuesday</em>; to me this implies that they were using /u:/ and not /ju:/.</p>\n", "Id":"230", "ParentId":"206", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T18:14:31.030", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"58", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-16T18:14:31.030", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"43", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"58", "AccountId":"264197", "Views":"14", "Reputation":"458", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:34:17.763", "DisplayName":"Anschel Schaffer-Cohen", "LastAccessDate":"2011-11-03T19:12:24.783"}}
