{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Not exactly the most orthodox source, but I find <a href=\"http://philpapers.org/rec/JOHACO-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnson &amp; Lappin's (1997)</a> synopsis concise and easy to follow for non-practitioners. As they explain,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...on the MP, a sentence is grammatical iff it is assigned a\n  well-formed (convergent)  PF  and LF  via  some  derivation D, but  a \n  derivation  D  is well-formed  iff  it  satisfies  all  the \n  constraints  and  is most highly valued  by the economy metric  with\n  respect to  a  set  of competing convergent derivations (its \n  \"reference  set\"). (275--6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So derivations, subject to grammaticality constraints and global conditions, create pairs of  representations. MP then models how sets of lexical items are converted to  representations. If it were a model of comprehension, it would model how PF representations are converted to LF representations. If it were a model of production, it would be the other way around. Since it is neither, the answer must be \"abstract enough to cover both.\"</p>\n", "Id":"1623", "ParentId":"1622", "CreationDate":"2012-03-13T02:59:52.410", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-13T02:59:52.410", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
