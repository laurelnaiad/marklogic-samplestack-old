{"Body":"<p>Things like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list\">Swadesh List</a> are an attempt at a vocabulary list along the lines you are talking about. The goal of such lists is to be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>universal</li>\n<li>culturally independent</li>\n<li>available in most languages</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another criterion that might matter for some applications is how stable the item is; i.e. how unlikely is it to be a loan word from another language. But this was not a stated goal of the Swadesh list, I don't believe.</p>\n", "Id":"432", "ParentId":"430", "LastEditorUserId":"165", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T19:50:27.157", "OwnerUserId":"165", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-22T21:05:10.513", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"45", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jtauber.com", "Id":"165", "AccountId":"39169", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T15:33:39.137", "AboutMe":"Entrepreneur and Pinax Lead Developer; Web Standards and Open Source Guy; Movie Producer and Digital Cinematographer; Composer and Music Theorist; Greek Scholar and Doctoral Student in Linguistics\r\n\r\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"Boston, MA", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"703", "DisplayName":"James Tauber", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-10T14:24:17.283"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-22T21:05:10.513", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"45", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jtauber.com", "Id":"165", "AccountId":"39169", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T15:33:39.137", "AboutMe":"Entrepreneur and Pinax Lead Developer; Web Standards and Open Source Guy; Movie Producer and Digital Cinematographer; Composer and Music Theorist; Greek Scholar and Doctoral Student in Linguistics\r\n\r\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"Boston, MA", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"703", "DisplayName":"James Tauber", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-10T14:24:17.283"}}
