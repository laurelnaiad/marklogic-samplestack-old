To native English ears, aspiration is very relevant to the consonants in question. In various other languages, it's not. As aspiration is considered an additional feature in the IPA, your sound samples avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly, distinguishing the sounds just takes practice. Your ears are trained to check for aspiration to find unvoiced consonants, so you'll have to \"untrain\" that. Also keep in mind that the vowels connected to them in the examples are always voiced, so you're really listening for whether there is a break in voicing or not.</p>\n", "Id":"15", "ParentId":"11", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:44:56.463", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"57", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-13T21:44:56.463", "CommentCount":"9"}
