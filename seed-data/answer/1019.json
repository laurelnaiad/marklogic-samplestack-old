The language used online in China is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_vernacular_Chinese\">vernacular written Chinese</a> (based on Mandarin). It would be very unusual to see 'Traditional Chinese' in a web interface.</p>\n\n<p>Although India is #2 in IM use, the majority of Indian web user's use English.
