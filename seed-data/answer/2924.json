Syncretism in a number of forms (as typical in the neuter in IE languages) does not mean that the structural categories themselves merge.</p>\n\n<p>And a language that \"fails\" to distinguish nominative and accusative case everywhere, cannot really be said to have either of them. (which would mean that arguments would have to be differentiated on some other basis, e.g. head-marking, word order, direct-inverse marking or so)</p>\n\n<p>If you have to tag a form that could be either nominative or accusative you'd usually employ whichever is appropriate in the context; if no context is given or you need to be explicit you can also indicate the syncretism e.g. as \"nom/acc\"</p>\n\n<p>edit:\nand you (mostly) got that case relationship wrong. with respect to their prototypical usage, nominative, accusative and dative are closer to each other as they all express argument roles while the genitive is typically used for possessor constructions (although in a number of IE languages some verbs do actually require a genitive argument, but this is a minor pattern)</p>\n", "Id":"2924", "ParentId":"2919", "CreationDate":"2012-12-02T18:34:13.273", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1380", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-02T18:34:13.273", "CommentCount":"2"}
