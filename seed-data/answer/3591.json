An example of this is the semi-jocular plurals of 'Unix' as 'Unices' and 'Unixen', instead of the predicted 'Unixes' /ˈjunɪksəz/.</p>\n\n<p>For the example you give, 'koopa', the expected plural form would be 'koopas', pronounced something like /kupəz/.</p>\n", "Id":"3591", "ParentId":"3589", "comments":[], "CreationDate":"2013-04-19T01:15:19.513", "Score":"11", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-19T08:17:01.983", "CommentCount":"1"}
