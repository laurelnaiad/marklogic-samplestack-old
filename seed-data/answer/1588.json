In Spanish there are verb conjugations like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>sEntir</strong> &lt;-> <strong>sIEnto</strong> &lt;-> <strong>sIntiendo</strong><br>\n  <strong>pOder</strong> &lt;-> <strong>pUEdo</strong> &lt;-> <strong>pUdiendo</strong>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>where the diphthongs only appear in certain forms. Portuguese does not do this, so it may seem that Portuguese uses diphthongs less.</p>\n\n<p>jogloran points out how this arose historically in Spanish and French and to a lesser degree in Italian, but not in Portuguese and Romanian. The Portuguese diphthongs arose from an entirely different mechanism. </p>\n\n<p>In Spanish, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language_influence_on_the_Spanish_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">the words borrowed from Arabic came into Spanish</a> after the vowel breaking from Vulgar Latin had already happened, and was no longer active. So any diphthongs in Arabic borrowings came from sounds already present in the Arabic.</p>\n", "Id":"1588", "ParentId":"1575", "CreationDate":"2012-03-07T02:17:12.877", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"537", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-07T02:17:12.877", "CommentCount":"2"}
