{"Body":"<p>Yes, it is possible to infer the full conjugation and pronunciation from the root of each verb for each binyan. There are exceptions to the rules, but even the exceptions have rules!</p>\n\n<p>The Binyanim are named after the form of the third person male past tense form, using the root פ-ע-ל. So the root ח-ש-ב in the binyan פָעָל would have the male past tense form חָשָב and in the binyan פִיעֵל would have the male past tense form חִישֵב.</p>\n\n<p>The most basic binyan is called פָעָל and it is the first taught to new Hebrew speakers as it is very simply and widely used. You can find the binyan explained here:\n<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/makefjulis/subject-1-7-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sites.google.com/site/makefjulis/subject-1-7-1</a></p>\n\n<p>Once you understand that, you can move on to other binyanim, they are all here:\n<a href=\"http://www.morim.com/memento%20binyanim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.morim.com/memento%20binyanim.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Note that second link uses כתב חסר when writing with vowel points, so in some places there will not be a yod where you might expect one. Just look at the tables, don't try to make sense of what is noted beyond that for the time being.</p>\n", "Id":"2283", "ParentId":"2282", "LastEditorUserId":"536", "CreationDate":"2012-07-21T12:57:49.873", "OwnerUserId":"536", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-23T14:33:28.813", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-23T14:33:28.813", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
