As you know, the standard mandarin pronunciation is KUNMING. I would not regard this as a phonological process because dialectal influence varies a lot among people in different places. If this is a phonological process, there should be only one standard form of pronunciation.  Nice trip there.</p>\n", "Id":"4839", "ParentId":"4832", "CreationDate":"2013-11-03T00:35:34.570", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2669", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-03T00:35:34.570", "CommentCount":"1"}
