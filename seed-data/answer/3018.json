{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>What you're describing is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtokavian_accentuation#Accentuation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neo-Štokavian accentuation</a>, the characteristic innovation of the Neo-Štokavian dialects of Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (including all the current literary forms), which apparently dates to no earlier than the 16th century. Very crudely speaking, Neo-Štokavian falling accents continue earlier accents on initial syllables, whilst Neo-Štokavian rising accents result from a shift where accented inner and final syllables retained their higher pitch, but had the actual stress retracted to the preceding syllable.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast with the marked accentual innovation of Neo-Štokavian, the pitch accent of the Čakavian dialects is apparently an extremely rare (if not unique) partial continuation of the accentual system of Common Slavic, and as such has attracted considerable scientific attention from Slavists.</p>\n\n<p>My apologies if I have bungled any terminology (or even worse, facts)--I'm afraid I'm a mathematician, not a Slavist!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I also see, to my embarrassment, that slavist has already said all that needs to be said on the matter. Had I the reputation, I'd have simply added a comment to his answer.</p>\n", "Id":"3018", "ParentId":"1999", "CreationDate":"2012-12-31T21:34:08.597", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1625", "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-31T21:34:08.597", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.math.tamu.edu/~branimir/", "Id":"1625", "AccountId":"2049003", "CreationDate":"2012-12-31T20:30:03.167", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a noncommutative geometer doing a postdoc at Texas A&amp;M, having just completed my PhD at Caltech.</p>\n", "Age":"28", "Location":"College Station, TX", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"155", "DisplayName":"Branimir Ćaćić", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T19:15:37.923"}}
