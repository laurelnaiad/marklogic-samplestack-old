{"Body":"<p>I think there've been a fair number of studies done in the realm of sign language recognition. One that could be a good place to get started is <em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17201534\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visual memory for shapes in deaf signers and nonsigners and in hearing signers and nonsigners: atypical lateralization and enhancement</a></em> by Cattani A, Clibbens J. and Perfect TJ.</p>\n\n<p>Fringe comment: Is this really a linguistics issue? I would challenge the conclusion that natural language does not have a good mechanism for describing faces... It seems to me that it's an issue of perception: Most people don't perceive visual details in a way that they can verbalize them. An exception, I suspect, is artists. If you asked an experienced portrait artist to describe someone's face, I think they'd do a very good job of it. </p>\n", "Id":"1828", "ParentId":"1793", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T23:17:05.057", "OwnerUserId":"908", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-20T09:06:47.103", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
