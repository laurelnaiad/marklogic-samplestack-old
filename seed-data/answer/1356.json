{"Body":"<p><em>Banana republic</em> is said ''república bananera'' in Spanish, even in Spain and not ''república platanera''. ;)\nSome people in Spain differentiate between a <em>plátano</em> and a <em>banana</em>, just like many people in Portugal use both <em>abacaxi</em> (for Brazil-imported pineapple) and <em>ananás</em> (for other pineapples).\n<em>Plátano</em> as a word is never really used in Central America or in Argentina. For example, the Argentinian Clarin dictionary considers it a Mexicanism.</p>\n\n<p><em>Plátano</em> and <em>banana</em> in Spanish, as well as <em>ananás</em> and <em>abacaxi</em> in Portuguese are like\n<em>anguria</em> and <em>cocomero</em> in Italian, there is no one single universal word for the fruit, there are only regional preferences.\nGerman had a similar ''problem'' with Apfelsine and Orange, but now Apfelsine (a NorthGerman word) is considered obsolete, and Orange (with French pronunciation) is almost universally used. In Argentina, ''ananá'' is more frequent than ''piña'' (and the plural is: ''ananás'').</p>\n", "Id":"1356", "ParentId":"690", "LastEditorUserId":"732", "CreationDate":"2012-02-01T22:53:25.610", "OwnerUserId":"732", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-01T23:40:36.503", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"732", "AccountId":"1214090", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"127", "CreationDate":"2012-02-01T06:19:16.837", "DisplayName":"Tom Sugnetic", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-05T21:16:40.087"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-01T23:40:36.503", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"732", "AccountId":"1214090", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"127", "CreationDate":"2012-02-01T06:19:16.837", "DisplayName":"Tom Sugnetic", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-05T21:16:40.087"}}
