It's tempting to just say, \"well that is the way it is, end of story\" Here are my ideas</p>\n\n<p>1 It's easy to translate/calque as a phrase. There isn't anything awkward about it and in English it forms a complete sentence.  Compare this to Chinese loans to English-- they are few and become unrecognizable.</p>\n\n<p>2 Plants have limited ranges, so who ever lives near that plant will likely name it first and the name would spread with the knowledge that the plant exists.  As it turns out for this plant, it has a wide range, so it is possible that in some places the locals had already come up with a word for it.  On the other hand, something like words banana and tea are likely to have traveled with the people who first named these plants.  In the case of Tea, WALS has lots of data on how the name of that plant and the loanwords spread.</p>\n", "Id":"677", "ParentId":"675", "CreationDate":"2011-10-03T15:16:14.887", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"20", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-03T15:16:14.887", "CommentCount":"1"}
