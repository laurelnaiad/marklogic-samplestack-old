{"Body":"<p>The Latin roots of the English word <strong><em>able</em></strong> are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>The verb <strong>habeo</strong>: \"to have, hold\"</p></li>\n  <li><p>The suffix <strong>-bilis</strong>: \"that ought or can easily be <code>[verb]</code>ed\"</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The (unattested) Latin form was *<em>habibilis</em>, as mentioned by Sihler and noted by Tom Recht below. In classical Latin, this had been shortened to <em>habilis</em>, as it often happens with double syllables (called <em>haplology</em>). The <em>h-</em> had disappeared in certain French forms and dialects by the time the word was borrowed by English, and <em>-lis</em> regularly evolved into <em>-le</em> in French, resulting in English acquiring the word <em>able</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Latin root of the English suffix <strong><em>-able</em></strong> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The suffix <strong>-bilis</strong>: \"capable or worthy of being <code>[verb]</code>ed\"</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>-a-</em> was originally only present in verbs whose stems ended on <em>-a-</em>, such as <em>ama-re</em> \"to love\", resulting in <em>ama-bilis</em> \"worthy of being loved\"; however, this was later extended to other formations with <em>-bilis</em>, resulting in an an alternative suffix <em>-abilis</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that the <em>-ilis</em> part in <em>-bilis</em> is related to the separate suffix <em>-ilis</em> as used in <em>habilis</em>, but I cannot find a definitive etymology for <em>-bilis</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"3239", "ParentId":"3235", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-02-21T06:09:25.273", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-09T02:38:53.997", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-09T02:38:53.997", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
