{"Body":"<p>The answer is you might be oversimplifying the facts. We have no data on Hawaiian or other ancient languages of Pacific phylum yet, but here are some points proving that at least Chinese and Japanese do not fall under the same category:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Chinese is basically monosyllable, CV, V, Vc or CVc-structured language while Japanese is a polysyllabic, mora-structured language. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Japanese used to have vowel harmony.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some languages of the area (Thai, Burmese and tribal languages of China) have different prosodic structures, including C2C1V- initial syllables.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are languages like Finnish or ancient Kretian sharing the same predominant CV- structure for syllable like Hawaiian or Japanese (although Hawaiianan word may also have +VV+ syllable structure), but this does not mean these languages are related by their syllable-structuring principles.</p>\n", "Id":"3877", "ParentId":"3780", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-06-19T13:20:18.780", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-19T15:57:54.427", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
