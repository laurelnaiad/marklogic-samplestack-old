{"Body":"<p>In Turkish, the suffic \"-cE\" gives this meaning when added to adjectives, such as \"güzelce\". It means that the person or thing is less beautiful than the mentioned thing. For instance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Annesi gibi güzelce bir kız </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It means that she is less beautiful than her mother. However, in some contexts it can mean \"nearly\". I asked which meaning people think of when they hear words to which this suffix was added; they answered \"less\". \nHowever, this research is not very broad or scientific; I have only asked the people I could contact. Maybe this answer will help you to some extent. </p>\n\n<p>I have found a <a href=\"http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=dc329b03-7232-48dc-a84e-4e711c9290bb@sessionmgr15&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=12&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=uvt&amp;AN=130555\">paper</a> about this suffix; however, the section related to it is very little and not very much detailed.</p>\n", "Id":"1391", "ParentId":"1376", "LastEditorUserId":"640", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T21:09:47.853", "OwnerUserId":"640", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-20T15:35:58.553", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"640", "AccountId":"1143371", "CreationDate":"2012-01-02T19:14:46.613", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Istanbul", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"325", "DisplayName":"Serpil Karabüklü", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-26T18:38:15.053"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-20T15:35:58.553", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"640", "AccountId":"1143371", "CreationDate":"2012-01-02T19:14:46.613", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Istanbul", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"325", "DisplayName":"Serpil Karabüklü", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-26T18:38:15.053"}}
