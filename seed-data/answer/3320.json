{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>My son grew up multilingual from the get-go. In India, my parents spoke with him in my mother-tongue (Marathi), my in-laws and acquaintances in the national language (Hindi), and I, mainly English. He started forming words and saying baby versions of multi-syllabic words like \"calendar\" by 8 months. By one year, he could speak sentences like \"Happy birthday to you\" (baby version, of course) and by 1.5 years, could smoothly change languages based on who he turned to speak with. Replies to questions would be in the language the questions were asked and if he wanted specific information, he would start in one language but change if it was someone replying in another language. I also exposed him to German at 4 and he seemed to take to it easily as well. </p>\n\n<p>I have seen other kids easily picking up 2-3 languages as toddlers - depending upon what the parents spoke at home as well as their nanny or other help. Even if the nanny spoke a completely different language (other than what their parents did), they picked it up. So, I believe children do pick up languages early - earlier than 9 months, if exposed to them early.</p>\n", "Id":"3320", "ParentId":"820", "CreationDate":"2013-03-06T16:09:59.783", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1829", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-06T16:09:59.783", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1829", "AccountId":"2455408", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2013-03-06T16:09:59.783", "DisplayName":"user1829", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-06T16:09:59.783"}}
