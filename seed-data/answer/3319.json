{"Body":"<p>A language is a tool for conveying meaning. If you can convey the meaning then the language is a <strong>good</strong> tool for that.</p>\n\n<p>All (really, <strong>all</strong>) modern languages are good for scientific expressions. If they weren't, they would have already died by today.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese and English are very different, for example, Chinese is much more idiomatic. And yes, the way you convey a meaning is different. There are thousands of examples of Chinese terms that don't translate to English accurately:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>火车 doesn't mean 火 (fire) + 车 (cart);</li>\n<li>网路 is not 网 (net) + 路 (path);</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm sure, you can give many, as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Difficulty to translate does not mean uselessness for science.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, it is possible that some terminology in scientific books is based on English, and, sometimes, is using <strong>English</strong> idiomaticity (\"net\" is a good example &mdash; computer network has nothing to do to fishnets and spider webs). For a foreigner, it may become a difficulty to grasp an entire meaning. But again, it does not mean the language is useless for science.</p>\n", "Id":"3319", "ParentId":"3318", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2013-03-06T15:34:08.337", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-06T15:46:52.217", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
