{"Body":"<p>This is a sound change operating on stressed vowels, variations of which arose in the daughter languages of Latin. The fact that the sound change only operates on stressed vowels explains occasional alternations (e.g. <em>juego</em> vs <em>jugamos</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Similar vowel-breaking phenomena arose in Spanish and French, but not in Portuguese or Catalan. Hence, Latin <em>petra</em> > Italian <em>pietra</em>, French <em>pierre</em>, Portuguese <em>pedra</em>. Also, vowel-breaking does indeed happen in Italian: consider Latin <em>focus</em> > It. <em>fuoco</em>, or L. <em>homo</em> > It. <em>uomo</em>. Although it doesn't appear as often in the verbal paradigm as it does in Spanish, there is the alternation <em>posso</em> vs <em>può</em>, and similarly <em>voglio</em> vs <em>vuole</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As for the question of <em>why</em> the variability exists in the daughter languages of Latin, the paper <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~linguist/faculty/Chitoran_Hualde_Ph07.pdf\">From hiatus to diphthong: the evolution of vowel sequences in Romance</a> by Ioana Chitoran and José Ignacio Huald, attempts to tie it to the phonetic inventory of each language.</p>\n\n<p>As for your last point, I'm not sure there is a relationship between this sound change and the nature of Arabic borrowings. Certainly Arabic borrowings such as Sp. <em>adobe</em> have a monophthong in stressed position.</p>\n", "Id":"1576", "ParentId":"1575", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "CreationDate":"2012-03-06T05:08:07.510", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-07T02:24:45.200", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
