{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There are actually two different types of correspondence that are at issue, and both are \"phonetic\", though in different ways. Gaston is correct that 'orthographic depth' is the variable that distinguishes (say) Finnish from French. But orthographies can be deep in either direction.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who can pronounce French can learn to read French aloud (whether they understand it or not) without much difficulty, once they learn the spelling conventions. But without knowing a great deal more, they wouldn't be able to know how to spell a word they'd heard aloud; I remember once trying to figure out all the different ways French might have spelled <em>cendrier</em>. French orthography is shallow for reading (input depth), but deep for spelling (output depth). </p>\n\n<p>This is not true of English orthography, which is deep on both input and output. A strange written word may have an unpredictable or inconsistent pronunciation (<em>bedraggled, bedridden</em>; <em>cough, rough, through</em>). And a strange spoken word might be spelled in any number of ways.</p>\n\n<p>This is yet another reason why linguists do not like to talk about \"phonetic writing systems\". All alphabetic writing systems are phonetic in some sense. But there are a lot of senses, and a lot of <strong>kinds</strong> of senses.</p>\n", "Id":"1081", "ParentId":"635", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T19:56:48.533", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-27T19:56:48.533", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
