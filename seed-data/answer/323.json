Formal grammars of communication systems that have no native speakers are being studied by people like Noam Chomsky (he's got some name after him).  The potential uselessness or artificiality of those kinds of grammars doesn't seem to hinder their study.</p>\n\n<p>Re Esperanto\nThere are linguists who study the Esperantists. There are also linguists who dismiss any project that has a whiff of amateur linguists and frauds and crackpots.</p>\n\n<p>I think your current question sounds kind of like \"when will artificial languages get any respect?\" Which isn't really an answerable question. It took American Indian languages a long time to get any respect as a target of study, endangered languages get more lip service than funds to study them.</p>\n", "Id":"323", "ParentId":"285", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T18:33:46.660", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"20", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-20T18:33:46.660", "CommentCount":"1"}
