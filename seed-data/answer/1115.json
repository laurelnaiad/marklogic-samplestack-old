One is the relationship between the verb (a head), 'uns-...' and its arguments (dependents), 'Bold' and 'naiz ohin-...-oo'. The other is between a possessor noun (dependent), 'Bold' and the possessed noun (head), 'naiz ohin-...'. In both cases, the relationship is marked on the dependent; Accusative case is marked on the object noun, and possessive is marked on the possessed noun, the two of which happen to be the same thing.</p>\n", "Id":"1115", "ParentId":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-12-06T14:04:15.993", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-06T14:04:15.993", "CommentCount":"1"}
