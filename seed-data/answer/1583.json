{"Body":"<p>It is useful to define a linguistic unit when there is evidence that some linguistic process is sensitive to that unit. For example, phonologists and phoneticians have long recognized that the concept of a syllable is a useful one due to evidence from scansion in poetry, syllable-final devoicing, processes related to stress and tone, phrase- and utterance-final syllable lengthening processes, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there are many processes that are easiest to describe when we are able to make reference to a diphthong as a unit. In <em>\"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0TET4eHHKEC&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;ots=nJKZ5KmLBI&amp;dq=evidence%20for%20diphthongs&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=evidence%20for%20diphthongs&amp;f=false\">English Phonology</a></em>\", John Tillotson Jensen raises three sources of evidence for the diphthong as a unit in English:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Backwards speech games - People who are asked to say the word \"choice\" backwards generally say [sojʧ] (and not [sjoʧ]), indicating that they are treating the vocalic portion of the word as a single unit.</li>\n<li>Syllabification - Glides can behave as syllable onsets, but words like Toyota are syllabified as toy.o.ta, suggesting that /oj/ is treated as a single unit (c.f. the Japanese syllabification to.yo.ta).</li>\n<li>Vowel shifts - Historically, many diphthongs are the result of vowel shifts that affected single vowels (e.g. the /aj/ diphthong in <em>divine</em>—c.f. <em>divinity</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In addition, it is common to observe dialectal differences that revolve around diphthongs. For example, in many dialects of English spoken in the south of the U.S., the /aj/ diphthong is \"monophthongized\" and produced as [aː] (where [ː] is the symbol for \"long\"). It makes sense to think of this phenomenon as monophthongization as opposed to \"glide dropping\" because those same speakers still produce the /j/ glide as [j] elsewhere, including after /a/ (i.e. a speaker that says [aː.ɛs] for <em>I.S.</em> will still say [aː.jɛs] for <em>ah yes</em>).</p>\n", "Id":"1583", "ParentId":"1577", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "CreationDate":"2012-03-06T16:41:28.923", "OwnerUserId":"385", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-06T18:29:01.753", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
