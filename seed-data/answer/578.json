{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The distinction is actually quite nebulous. Indeed, people are often led more by tradition to classify things as clitics/affixes than by actual linguistic argumentation. I think that many people go back to Zwicky's work on the topic (1977), though Spencer (2000) argues that better typologies of \"clitic-hood\" exist. Chapter 9 'Clitics' of Spencer's book 'Morphological Theory' discusses these issues a bit. I refer you to Spencer for some background.</p>\n\n<p>The assumption, and the source of much of the clitic-related confusion, is that clitics will not trigger stem allomorphy or different phonological processes on the stem. (Indeed, the last poster was arguing against this interpretation.) Linguists have, I think, wrongly assumed that the syntactic status of clitics renders them unable to interact with the phonology or morphology. It is probably better to get outside of the \"affix/clitic\" dichotomy and think instead of syntactic dependence and conditioned allomorphy as independent properties. This requires really separating the syntactic behavior of elements from their morphophonology.</p>\n", "Id":"578", "ParentId":"562", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T22:12:04.687", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"323", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-27T22:12:04.687", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"323", "AccountId":"939711", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T22:12:04.687", "DisplayName":"Christian DiCanio", "LastAccessDate":"2011-09-29T12:26:53.287"}}
