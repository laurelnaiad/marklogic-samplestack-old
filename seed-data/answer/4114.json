E.g. formative \"s\" could be a plural exponent.</p>\n", "Id":"4114", "ParentId":"4112", "CreationDate":"2013-08-05T12:50:55.243", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-05T12:50:55.243", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
