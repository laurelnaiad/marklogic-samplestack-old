{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Weakening of consonants (typically stops > fricatives > approximants > nothing) is a process which has affected many languages at many times. It's particularly noticeable in French because, as you say, the orthography predates the change; but the same is true for certain patterns in English (most words that contain 'gh', for example, and for non-rhotic accents such as most dialects of England, 'r' after a vowel).</p>\n\n<p>What is slightly unusual in French is that final consonants have often been lost <em>except</em> where followed by a vowel - it's much more common to find consonants lost between vowels, and indeed this happened in French earlier, eg Lat. <em>credere</em> > Fr. <em>croire</em>. But the fact that the process has mostly affected only word-final consonants means that it is a different process.</p>\n", "Id":"2636", "ParentId":"2632", "CreationDate":"2012-09-29T13:19:21.733", "Score":"10", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"718", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-29T13:19:21.733", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"90", "Location":"England, United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"718", "AccountId":"34526", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"1364", "CreationDate":"2012-01-27T00:02:42.473", "DisplayName":"Colin Fine", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:15:12.837"}}
