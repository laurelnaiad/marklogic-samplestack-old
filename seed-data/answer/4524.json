{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>English uses syntactic configurations that need to be learnt. According to some linguists, configurationality is a scale from completely fixed word order (no language has it) to completely free word order in so-called radically nonconfigurational language (Latin and Warlpiri are examples of such languages). Word order expresses information structure (topic-focus articulation) and since it's relatively fixed in English (as a result of impoverished morphology), I suppose that what your friends meant is that English discourse is seemingly less coherent for them because information structure is expressed by different means (syntax instead of word order).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, non-German speakers have problems with intrasentential coherence in German because nonfinite verbs occur in the nachfeld (although word order in the mittelfeld is completely free). In my opinion, German sentence topology is much more challenging than English configurationality.</p>\n", "Id":"4524", "ParentId":"4523", "CreationDate":"2013-09-22T11:03:02.680", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2451", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-22T11:03:02.680", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"54", "Location":"Prague, Czech Republic", "DownVotes":"3", "Id":"2451", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"935824", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"782", "CreationDate":"2013-09-09T18:11:01.840", "DisplayName":"Atamiri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:11:49.140", "Age":"36"}}
