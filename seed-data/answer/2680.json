{"Body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code switching</a> is common in India. So, even when writing to each other in English on facebook or IM, many Indians tend to insert phrases from one or more Indian languages. When people do that, they do not use one of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration\" rel=\"nofollow\">standard transliteration schemes</a>. Most Sanskrit books, when printed for an English-speaking audience, use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration\" rel=\"nofollow\">IAST</a>.  However, that's difficult to type on a computer. I prefer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRANS\" rel=\"nofollow\">ITRANS</a>, and that's what I'd recommend for you.</p>\n\n<p>\"Is there a common way to phonetically transcribe Hindi?\"</p>\n\n<p>In the \"common way\", people don't aim to be accurate; they just aim to be understood by a fluent speaker of Hindi. Since you're not a fluent speaker of Hindi, I advise against the common way.</p>\n", "Id":"2680", "ParentId":"2673", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2012-10-11T15:53:33.343", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-11T16:01:33.583", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-11T16:01:33.583", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
