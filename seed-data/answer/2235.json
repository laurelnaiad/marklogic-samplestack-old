{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The invented languages of twins, sometimes called 'twinspeak' are also known as cryptophasia or idioglossia. Peter Bakker of Aarhus University (Denmark) has published on this topic (abstract available <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3434134\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). According to Bakker twin languages are very common, occurring in about 40% of all twins, but soon disappear.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the structure of these languages, Bakker writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In all cases known, the language consists of onomatopoeic expressions,\n  some invented words, but for the greatest part of words from the adult\n  language adopted to the constrained phonological possibilities of\n  young children. These words being hardly recognizable, the language\n  may turn out to be completely unintelligible to speakers of the model\n  languages, but they resemble each other in that they lack morphology\n  and that word order is based on pragmatic principles such as saliency\n  and the semantic scope of words. Neither the structure of the\n  languages nor its emergence can be explained by other than situational\n  factors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Bakker article seems to be hard to obtain.
