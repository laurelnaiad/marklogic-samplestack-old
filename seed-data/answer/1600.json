{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I've never heard of any specific movement that would obligatorily accompany a specific word or phrase.</p>\n\n<p>However, especially if you count facial expression as movement, certain rhetoric strategies are, I believe, accompanied at least very often by movement. Sarcasm, mockery and such typically involve a specific intonation and facial expression. In that sense I can see how a certain phrase could begin to usually cooccur with a specific expression through being used primarily in an ironic sense. I suppose that this also accounts to a certain degree for the popularity of emoticons: without them it's often diffucult to decide if what one's reading is a joke or serious.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em> might often come together with head movement but it's surely not a rule.</p>\n\n<p>On a theoretical ground, I can say this would be a relatively unlikely thing to happen, as being obviously redundant. The only scenario that comes to my mind that could lead to an obligatory cooccurrence, is with 'holy' or taboo words, where e.g. a certain movement could perhaps possibly be required in some culture when mentioning the name of a god, demon or something of the kind.</p>\n", "Id":"1600", "ParentId":"1599", "CreationDate":"2012-03-08T17:42:58.197", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"794", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-08T17:42:58.197", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}}
