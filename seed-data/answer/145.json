{"Body":"<p>ISN is really important in the study of language - it's the first time that a language has been tracked almost since its inception. Judy Kegl, the linguist who came to Nicaragua at the request of their government, started working on ISN in 1986, only about 7 years after the deaf school opened. Some Creole languages aren't particularly old but no one was there to study their acquisition by children in such a detailed way.</p>\n\n<p>To say the language came from \"nothing\" is a bit deceptive - many of the children had \"home sign\" systems which they would use to communicate with their hearing family members - but these were incredibly basic and impoverished sign systems compared to the ISN. Kegl was able to work with the earliest students at the school and the cohort that was then in 1986 and compare the sophistication of their language. </p>\n", "Id":"145", "ParentId":"139", "LastEditorUserId":"64", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T22:08:29.657", "OwnerUserId":"64", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-14T22:40:48.193", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"126", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.superlinguo.com", "Id":"64", "AccountId":"900445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:45:12.903", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a PhD in linguistics.
