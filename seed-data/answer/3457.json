{"Body":"<p>As a speech-language therapist (M.S., CCC-SLP), I have met people who obviously perceive the world and who just as obviously lack language.   </p>\n\n<p>During my training, I worked briefly with someone with global aphasia.   Thanks to certain brain injuries, such as strokes, some people wind up with aphasia, or loss of some of their language abilities.   The most severe form of aphasia, namely total loss of the ability to communicate with conventional (i.e. arbitrary) symbols, is called global aphasia.   See this Wikipedia article on global aphasia:  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_aphasia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_aphasia</a>    </p>\n\n<p>Global aphasia differs from dementia in that global aphasia patients can do well on non-verbal IQ tests and on many tasks that do not require symbol use, whereas the victims of severe dementia score low on tests of language and cognition and have difficulty doing most tasks.   </p>\n\n<p>Strokes and brain injuries arent' the only conditions that can manifest themselves in the lack of language.   Over the last ten years or so, I have worked with increasing numbers of students whose autism is so severe that they have not acquired an L1, and must be taught to communicate with picture exchange.  </p>\n\n<p>caseyr547 has already mentioned Genie.  You may wish to read the book \"Genie, a Scientific Tragedy\" by Russ Rymer.   Her case is instructive, but one need not look at such rare cases to document perception without language.   </p>\n", "Id":"3457", "ParentId":"3200", "LastEditorUserId":"790", "CreationDate":"2013-03-29T03:28:24.773", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-31T00:52:39.207", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
