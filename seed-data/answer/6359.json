{"Body":"<p>The difference could be described as that between past-perfectiveness (теперь) VS durativeness / progressivness (including future perfectivness) (сейчас). </p>\n\n<p>These categories are not normally distinguished  in Russian language analytically, but rather as a synthectical form of a verb, or by a corresponding adverbal (теперь VS сейчас), or by the both methods.</p>\n\n<p>Теперь я Чебурашка. (= Now I am Cheburashka; a fictional character from a story for children, meaning 'After some previous history I am what I am').</p>\n\n<p>Сейчас я Чебурашка. (= Now I am Cheburashka, but focusing on the speaker's state at the moment of speech).</p>\n\n<p>Теперь отправлю пост. (= 'Now I am going to send the post'; meaning that after a sequence of preceding events, the speaker is going to send the post).</p>\n\n<p>Сейчас отправлю пост. (= 'Now I am going to send the post'; meanig that the speaker is going to publish the post right now, or that (s)he is focusing on the nearest future, cf. the previous example.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, <em>теперь</em> marks a present moment as referred to a preceding (past) state of things, or something new (rhema, topic or comment) while <em>сейчас</em> is 'right now' or 'from now on'. On the other hand, both adverbs can mark a topic/commentary as well, since in Russian a meaning can be derived not from just grammar or syntax or word order, but from an intonation as well.</p>\n", "Id":"6359", "ParentId":"6358", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2014-01-09T17:02:04.640", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-11T15:47:52.170", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
