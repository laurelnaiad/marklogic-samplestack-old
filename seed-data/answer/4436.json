Hence, we obtain mama, nana, baba, papa. The m/n/a\nset becomes the first person - me. Any other person is identified by the tooth sound d, d becoming t, t becoming s, s becoming h, h becoming a mere breath or then ceasing to exist. Hence, we obtain dada and tata.

The t/\ns/h series, being the non-me series, is , naturally, used as the tool for making \npronouns and the definite article.
