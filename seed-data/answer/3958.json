Conciseness <em>could</em> be such a goal, but I do not remember encountering an actual conlang where it was (John Lawler mentions a fictional example, in Heinlein's <em>Speedtalk</em>, and Vaclav Havel's play <em>The Memorandum</em> turns on a conlang called <em>Ptydepe</em>, in which the most common words are the shortest, and the least common the longest). </p>\n\n<p>As John Lawler says in his comment, redundancy is actually very common in real-world languages, and for a good reason: because speech is often used in noisy environments (in the communication-theory sense of \"noisy\" as well as the everyday sense). Extreme brevity would be likely to lose much of that redundancy, and it is not clear exactly what would be gained to offset that. </p>\n\n<p>So the simple answer is \"Because that was not one of Zamenhof's goals\". He was much more concerned with regularity, and with ease of learning.</p>\n", "Id":"3958", "ParentId":"3957", "CreationDate":"2013-07-02T22:35:11.490", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"718", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-02T22:35:11.490", "CommentCount":"1"}
