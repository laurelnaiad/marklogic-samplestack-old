On the other hand, there is some recent work that might give you an idea of how similar questions are being approached. \nThere is a good summary article (<a href=\"http://chd.ucsd.edu/_files/fall2008/Croft.2006.ICHL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Croft 2006</a>) outlining Croft's \"evolutionary\" approach to language change.
