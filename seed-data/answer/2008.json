Essentially, certain long vowels in PIE acquired a feature that's just termed \"acuteness\", but may have been laryngealization, something like the Danish st√∏d. Later on stressed acute vowels developed a rising pitch, leading to the Proto-Balto-Slavic contrast of \"acute\" (rising pitch) and \"circumflex\" (falling pitch) stressed vowels.</p>\n\n<p>Southwest Slavic is the only place in the modern Slavic languages where you still see a pitch accent system nowadays (although it's still there in Lithuanian as well), but it was definitely present in all of the Slavic languages early on. Reflexes of this pitch system still survive, for example, in some of modern Russian's stress patterns or in some vowel length alternations in Czech.</p>\n", "Id":"2008", "ParentId":"1999", "CreationDate":"2012-05-28T19:51:30.823", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1054", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-28T19:51:30.823", "CommentCount":"1"}
