There are several areas one can look at for something like this, like if the speaker's phonology is the same as a native speaker, or if the speaker has a lexical command equivalent to a native speaker.  Fluency could be looked at too, but one can be non-fluent in a language and still have near-native command of a language.  This is because fluency is actually just referring to the ability of a speaker to speak at a constant rate without having to pause to think of vocabulary or how to phrase something grammatically.</p>\n", "Id":"428", "ParentId":"423", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T17:50:12.630", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"150", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-22T17:50:12.630", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"150", "AccountId":"409031", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"535", "CreationDate":"2011-09-17T17:33:21.593", "DisplayName":"Mark Tuttle", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-29T16:52:17.370"}}
