{"Body":"<p>Short answer: yes. </p>\n\n<p>First example that comes to mind is Japan, or 日本 (nihon; nippon) in Japanese. In Chinese the reading for the characters 日本 is Rìběn.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, China /'tʃaɪnə/ is 中国 (Zhōngguó) in Mandarin and Chine /'ʃin/ in French. </p>\n\n<p>As @Sjiveru mentions, there's also the example of Hungary, which is more like your German example, since the difference in naming has to do with different groups occupying the territory historically. @Sjiveru mentions that: \"Hungary [is]...Magyarórszág in Hungarian...[and is called Hungary] because that's where the Huns settled in the 400s AD -- the modern-day 'Hungarian' people (Magyars) didn't end up there until the 800s or so.\" Also mentioned is Finland, which is Suomi in Finnish.</p>\n\n<p>I also think that a fuller answer will depend on how different a name has to be to count as \"different\" in your book, though we could potentially define different as \"originating from a different source\". In that case, the Japan example falls apart, since it seems that folks believe the name \"Japan\" to be based on the Portuguese pronunciation of the Japanese or Chinese name for the country.</p>\n", "Id":"3997", "ParentId":"3996", "LastEditorUserId":"146", "CreationDate":"2013-07-12T19:39:48.263", "OwnerUserId":"146", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-13T02:41:36.213", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.davehowcroft.com", "Id":"146", "AccountId":"386467", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T04:22:32.443", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a graduate student in the Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University.
