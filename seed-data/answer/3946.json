To get a good overview of the topic, look at the <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/opinion-mining-sentiment-analysis-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">book's website</a> which has links to presentation slides.</p>\n\n<p>I see that you want to implement the software on your own, and you want to (re-)invent algorithms too. The reasons behind these is not entirely clear. If you are writing a research paper or a thesis on the topic, you would need to do both. Otherwise, you can (1) look for free software for sentiment analysis; if you can't find any, or the licenses are unsuitable for your use, (2) learn techniques from published papers that demonstrate good results for the kind of classification you wish to do. There are a few workshops on this topic, and the website keeps changing from year to year, based on who is hosting it. In general, you could look for papers at \"Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis\" (<a href=\"http://optima.jrc.it/wassa2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WASSA-13</a>, for example) or at \"Practice and Theory of Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis\" (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/pathosworkshop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PATHOS-2013</a>, for example).</p>\n", "Id":"3946", "ParentId":"3938", "CreationDate":"2013-07-01T19:07:44.323", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-01T19:07:44.323", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
