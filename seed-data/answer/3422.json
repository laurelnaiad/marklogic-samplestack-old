{"Body":"<p>As I understand it, the raising is from *<em>we want that he buys groceries</em> to <em>we want him to buy groceries</em>, and the \"high\" level is the main clause; the content of a fictional subordinate <em>that</em> clause is raised to the level of the main clause, in the form of an object plus an infinitive (in this case). After all, <em>sub</em>-ordination means \"ordering below\".</p>\n\n<p>Why do we even posit such a fictional subordinate clause that never really existed? You could argue against this practice. But I think the main reason is semanto-pragmatic; that is, it cannot really be proven syntactically in any way. We somehow presume that there is in language a \"standard\" model of expressing an agent and a situation that the agent applies a modal opinion to, and that this model is a main clause with agent plus modality, followed by a subordinate clause containing the situation.</p>\n", "Id":"3422", "ParentId":"3418", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-03-23T20:20:24.940", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-24T01:12:40.477", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-24T01:12:40.477", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
