{"Body":"<p>Since you specified about the TID<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> in the comments, I made a search specifically about it. What I found is a paper titled <em>\"<a href=\"http://signlanguage-bg.com/bg/publication/eng/11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aspects of Türk İşaret Dili</a>\"</em> by Ulrike Zeshan, which analysis various features of the Turkish Sign language.</p>\n\n<p>In the paragraph \"2.2 Types of nonmanual negation\"<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>, the author address various ways of negating using methods that don't include hand signing: <em>head movements</em> and <em>facial expressions</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning the second, which is what we're interested in there is something about the use of the mouth (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whereas both the negative headshake and the backward head tilt are very common\n  in TID, <em>a third nonmanual signal that can convey negation is rather marginal in the\n  language, yet nevertheless very interesting</em>. In some rather rare contexts that still need\n  to be speciﬁed, <strong>a puﬀ of the cheeks with subsequent release of the air trapped in the\n  mouth has a negative meaning</strong> (Figure 8 and videoclip 6). <strong>Moreover, the signal carries\n  its negative meaning even in the absence of a manual negator sign, that is, it is\n  suﬃcient to negate a clause by itself</strong>. In the following example, it is repeated because\n  the predicate it co-occurs with also has repeated movement. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then it continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The use of this nonmanual signal is interesting because, to the best of my knowledge,\n  facial expressions have not been shown to function as negators on their own. Various\n  facial expressions, such as frowning or pulling down the corners of the mouth, do\n  accompany negation in many sign languages (e.g. Bergman 1995 for Swedish Sign\n  Language, Coerts 1992 for Sign Language of the Netherlands, Berthiaume &amp; Rinfret\n  2000 for Langue des Signes Québécoise). <strong>However, it is often unclear whether they\n  should be considered grammatical or affective facial expressions.</strong> In any case, they\n  always occur in addition to some other manual or nonmanual marking of negation,\n  not as the sole marker of negation as in the above example from TID. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Up to this point I still had some doubts but another paper, concerning facial expressions recognition, <em>\"<a href=\"http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/allthesis/m_2008_AriIsmail.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facial feature tracking and expression recognition for sign\nlanguage</a>\"</em> by İsmail Arı, about the previous work said that<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sign language expressions are performed with the combination of manual (hand\n  gestures) and non-manual components (facial expressions, head motion and pose, body\n  movements). Some expressions are performed only using hand gestures whereas some\n  change the meaning where a facial expression accompanies hand gestures. <strong>For example,\n  in Turkish Sign Language (TSL), a sentence can be in positive, negative and question\n  clause forms if the hand gesture of the verb is accompanied by different non-manual\n  gestures as Zeshan [35] describes in her work on TSL.</strong> [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I'd say that facial expressions certainly provide a suprasegmental and grammatical feature too, although <em>this doesn't make them part of the sign</em>. In other words, a sign's meaning is not incomplete without these nonmanual gestures, unless you need to provide some grammatical feature (negation, question, etc.). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>1</strong>: Turkish Sign Language in Turkish: \"Türk İşaret Dili\".
