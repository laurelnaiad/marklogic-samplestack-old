{"Body":"<p>There can be some confusion when we ask about how to describe a \"sentence\", and then discuss properties of how the sentence is written down.  We should distinguish <em>language</em> from <em>writing</em> ; they are distinct things, with independent properties.  Writing is (basically) a representation of language.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let's think of  the language first.  The key question is, what linguistic utterance is that piece of writing <em>representing</em>?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If it's representing \"I live in Měiguó\" (or \"I live in Mei⁵gwok³\", etc.), then the sentence displays <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_switching\" rel=\"nofollow\">code-switching</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword\" rel=\"nofollow\">borrowing</a>.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Macaronic</em> is a somewhat more informal term for frequent code-switching, sometimes mixing parts of words.  I wouldn't say this sentence looks particularly macaronic, though it could be part of a larger macaronic rant.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If it's representing \"I live in America\"—that is, if the characters ‹美国› are supposed to be read as \"America\", the way e.g. Japanese read ‹大人› as <em>otona</em>—then there's no code-switching or borrowing going on.  It's just an everyday English sentence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now we turn to writing.  ‹I live in 美国› is a mixture of two writing systems.  I believe \"mixed orthography\" or \"mixed writing\" are reasonable labels for this phenomenon.  This is independent of how many languages are being represented; for example, ‹I live in Америкa› is mixed writing representing a pure English sentence.</p>\n", "Id":"3662", "ParentId":"3602", "LastEditorUserId":"200", "CreationDate":"2013-05-08T14:35:10.240", "OwnerUserId":"200", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-09T01:19:12.583", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"15", "WebsiteUrl":"http://namakajiri.net/nikki", "Location":"Brazil", "Id":"200", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"531597", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"421", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T20:19:46.470", "DisplayName":"leoboiko", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-16T22:57:14.117", "AboutMe":"<p>Japanese Studies grad student.
