{"Body":"<p>Gesenius's <em>Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon</em> states that it is the present participle of a root ayin-waw-dalet, meaning 'return' or 'repeat', with an Arabic cognate <em>`ƒÅda</em> -- the idea apparently being that a witness is one who 'repeats' what he saw. It's presumably not an Aramaic borrowing, since it occurs already in Genesis. Gesenius lists the meaning 'testimony' in addition to 'witness'. In modern Hebrew, though, it only means 'witness'; 'testimony' is a related noun, <em>edut</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether it's related to <em>`ad</em> 'eternity', Gesenius thinks not: he derives the latter from a different root ayin-dalet-he. It seems conceivable that the two roots could be related further back, though; at least, one could certainly imagine a semantic relationship between 'return' and 'eternity'.</p>\n", "Id":"4815", "ParentId":"4814", "LastEditorUserId":"2411", "CreationDate":"2013-10-30T01:35:31.840", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-30T04:34:34.467", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-30T04:34:34.467", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
