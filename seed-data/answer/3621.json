{"Body":"<p>Yes, this is true and yes, in most cases indefinite articles indeed developed from numerals, as @MGN already said. </p>\n\n<p>Not only there's no evidence of articles in PIE, the lack of articles is a more common phenomena than it can be expected to be from the Standard Average European point of view. Here's <a href=\"http://inchiostro.unipv.it/uploads/pagine/855405872_Santiago_Giacalone.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">an interesting quote on issue quote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The geographical distribution of articles on a worldwide basis (WALS\n  2005) confirms the Western European peculiarity: while languages\n  lacking articles are common (out of 566 languages, only 188 have no\n  definite or indefinite articles and 41 have no definite, but only\n  indefinite articles), one area in which lack of definite article is\n  infrequent is Western Europe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, as it can be read in the article provided, the upcoming process of \ngrammaticalization of articles can be observed nowadays in some Slavic languages.</p>\n\n<p>Even more, there are some hypothesis that definite articles in some cases underwent further evolution and transformed to some other grammar units.
