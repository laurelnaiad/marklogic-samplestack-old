The most relevant quote from his paper is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Buenos Aires dialect] data differ from the cross-dialectal data \n  analyzed in Gabriel (2007) insofar as there is at least some evidence\n  of <strong>VO[<sub>F</sub>S]</strong>. In the [Patagonian dialect] data, by contrast,\n  not a single occurrence of <strong>VO[<sub>F</sub>S]</strong> was attested.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I.e., in Porteño Spanish, \"<em>MARÍA compró el diario</em>\" and \"<em>compró el diario MARÍA</em>\" were both found, while in Patagonian Spanish, \"<em>compró el diario MARÍA</em>\" was never found.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course this is limited to two Argentinian dialects, but it shows <strong>there is dialectal variation of focusing strategies</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly it is also a bit different than what you say are Zubizaretta's original results. In your example above you say that <strong>[<sub>F</sub>S]VO</strong> was infelicitous to Zubizaretta; but your South American friend found the opposite, in accord with Gabriel's results. So that may be yet another dialectal variation; I don't have access to Zubizaretta's book to know.</p>\n\n<p>Also: Gabriel says that contrastive focus is treated differently than informational focus, and that phonetic stress is as important as movement for focusing constituents. Your examples above exhibit informational focus. </p>\n", "Id":"1596", "ParentId":"1544", "CreationDate":"2012-03-08T03:11:17.923", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"537", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-08T03:11:17.923", "CommentCount":"2"}
