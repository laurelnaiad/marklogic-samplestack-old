{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>My advisor, Dennis Preston, used to tell students that the ear hears phonetics, but the brain hears phonology.  That is, your ear is capable of processing whatever linguistic sounds are given to it (assuming someone with normal hearing), but your language experience causes your brain to filter out only those sound patterns that are important to your language(s).  </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this summary simplifies things considerably.  Phonologists are often as interested in patterns related to the manner of articulation as they are the patterns of the speech waves.  Phoneticians, meanwhile, would have no way to analyze their data sets if they didn't have phonological categories to help organize them.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, phonetics is the study of fine grained details of those sounds, while phonology has traditionally dealt with analysis of greater abstractions.  For understandable reasons, the line between the two discipliens is blurring, particularly as our modeling capabilities become more sophisticated. Still, the distinction is useful.  </p>\n", "Id":"716", "ParentId":"180", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T14:30:18.290", "Score":"11", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"392", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-06T14:30:18.290", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.LingEducator.com", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"392", "AccountId":"957254", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"251", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T14:13:10.473", "DisplayName":"Ocumpaugh", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-10T12:37:04.217"}}
