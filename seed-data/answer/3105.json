{"Body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] the word initial inflections in verbs in Irish came from phonological interaction between a pronoun and the following verb [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean here.</p>\n\n<p>Irish is VSO. As such, a verb very rarely (if indeed ever) follows a pronoun:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Chonaic  mé    an       cailín.\nSaw-PRET I-NOM the-SING girl-MASC.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can see the use of prepositions (more so the associate agreements) in Irish affecting the past tense, though. Traditionally, the past tense was created by preceding the infinitive with to preposition \"do\" (Ith -> D'ith), which causes a lenition (Bí -> Do bhí -> Bhí).</p>\n", "Id":"3105", "ParentId":"127", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2013-01-22T23:58:10.970", "OwnerUserId":"1117", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-23T14:58:25.173", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
