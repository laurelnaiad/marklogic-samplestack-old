I don't accept the \"too complex to be coincidence\" argument. Given a large set of symbols of numerical (or other) value, connections are bound to occur. Not finding anything like this would be amazing.</p>\n\n<p>Simple relationships, such as \"Father + Mother = Child\" could also be coincidence but they could easily have be designed or at least \"encouraged\". Considering the significance of numbers in religion, a connection like this could almost be required for such a fundamental statement. So, if it wasn't there already, synonyms could be encouraged or new words coined to make it true.</p>\n\n<p>It would be interesting to know how many of these were purely by chance and how many were designed or encouraged. It probably wouldn't be possible to know for sure without a record of the words/letters before association with numbers. [Then we could see if the \"coincidences\" increased or remained the same.]</p>\n", "Id":"3294", "ParentId":"3293", "CreationDate":"2013-02-27T23:17:39.340", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1767", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-27T23:17:39.340", "CommentCount":"5"}
