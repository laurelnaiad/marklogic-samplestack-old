{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I think hippietrail is on the right track.  Two things are worth mentioning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Basic_Color_Terms%3a_Their_Universality_and_Evolution\">famous study by Berlin and Kay</a> on the subject of color term hierarchies in language (e.g. if a language has a word for \"blue\" it must also have a term for \"red,\" whereas the reverse does not hold).  Lots of follow-up research has been done on this subject.  \"Orange\" is relatively high on the hierarchy, i.e. according to the theory a language must already have a lot of other color terms before it can develop a word for \"orange.\"</li>\n<li>The English word \"pink\" comes from the name of a flower (also \"pink\").  Many other IE languages have a word derived from \"rose\" for this color.  Irish has \"white-red,\" though (no idea if this is a neologism).  \"Pink\" is also high on the Berlin &amp; Kay hierarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"623", "ParentId":"620", "CreationDate":"2011-09-30T07:23:17.653", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-30T07:23:17.653", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
