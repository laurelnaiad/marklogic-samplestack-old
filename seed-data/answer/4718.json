The spoken forms almost always eventually prevail and become the new standard, but there can be a considerable gap between the two. </p>\n\n<p>In French, the possessive construction with \"à\" (\"le livre à Michel\", \"la soeur à Matthieu\") is in use since the Middle ages, and everyone uses it every day. However, normative grammars consider it \"incorrect\" in this context. </p>\n\n<p>Conversely, <em>entire tenses</em> that no longer exist in spoken French are still part of its written norm (the best example is the <em>passé simple</em>). </p>\n\n<p>Conclusion : being widely used is a necessary condition for a form to become part of the written norm, but by no means is it a sufficient condition. </p>\n\n<p>Endorsement by someone who's considered an authority on the (current) norm is neither sufficient nor even necessary, but it may popularize the form, especially in writing.</p>\n", "Id":"4718", "ParentId":"4706", "CreationDate":"2013-10-12T19:14:09.310", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2105", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-12T19:14:09.310", "CommentCount":"3"}
