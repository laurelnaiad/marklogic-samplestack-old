{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>French and other Romance languages provide an example, actually – verbs are arbitrarily associated with theme vowels.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in Spanish (I am not familiar with French), the infinitive form of <em>to have</em> is <em>ten<b>e</b>r</em>, and that of <em>to take</em> is <em>tom<b>a</b>r</em>. The bolded vowel, traditionally called \"theme\", affects most of the inflected forms of the verb: <em>tienes</em> (you have) vs. <em>tomas</em> (you take), <em>tiene</em> vs <em>toma</em> (third person singular), <em>tenéis</em> vs. <em>tomáis</em> (second person plural), etc.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, these are inherent properties of the verbs, not simply a part of their phonological form: in the Spanish subjunctive, verbs with an <em>e</em> or <em>i</em> theme take <em>a</em> in the theme position and verbs with an <em>a</em> theme take <em>e</em> in the theme position. For example, <em>tomas</em> becomes <em>tom<b>e</b>s</em>, and <em>tienes</em> becomes <em>teng<b>a</b>s</em>. (Obviously, there are some other things going on here morphophonologically, but the important part is the theme vowel.)</p>\n\n<p>More generally, grammatical gender, theme vowels, and the Germanic verb classes mentioned in Aaron's answer, are kinds of inflectional class (in the modern sense, not the more limited traditional sense), i.e. arbitrary groups of roots/stems identifiable by a morphological reflex.</p>\n", "Id":"1926", "ParentId":"1922", "CreationDate":"2012-05-13T07:36:23.390", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"941", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-13T07:36:23.390", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"9", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.didyoulearnanything.net", "Location":"Germany", "Id":"941", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"522746", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"317", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T09:51:50.690", "DisplayName":"michaelsappir", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-14T14:20:51.253", "Age":"26"}}
