{"Body":"<p>\"Iesous\" isn't a Greek-sounding name, and I can't imagine how there could be any influence from Latin. The name \"Iesous\" doesn't occur in Greek literature outside of Jewish and Christian contexts (first in the Septuagint, second century BC). According to the Wikipedia article on the name <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshua_%28name%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshua</a>, Jesus may have gone by Yeshua or even Yeshu. So the difference from the Greek form is not necessarily that great. Greek did not have the sound \"sh\" and seems to have borrowed foreign names that had this sound using \"s\". For instance, Samouel, from Hebrew Shmu'el and perhaps Kuros from Persian Kurush. (I expect there are many further examples, but these are all that come to me at the moment.)</p>\n", "Id":"4285", "ParentId":"3530", "LastEditorUserId":"2402", "CreationDate":"2013-08-27T19:36:48.623", "OwnerUserId":"2402", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-27T21:48:13.500", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2402", "AccountId":"3214318", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-08-25T20:28:43.350", "DisplayName":"user39080", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-06T23:43:48.230"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-27T21:48:13.500", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2402", "AccountId":"3214318", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"91", "CreationDate":"2013-08-25T20:28:43.350", "DisplayName":"user39080", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-06T23:43:48.230"}}
