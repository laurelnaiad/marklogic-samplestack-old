{"Body":"<p>Let me start from the definitions first. According to the Speech Act Theory, an utterance can be <strong>constative</strong> or <strong>performative</strong>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A <em>constative utterance</em> is one which makes an assertion but is <strong>not</strong> performative.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>\"John promised to repay me tomorrow\"</em>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The utterance describes a promise (made by John), but is not by itself a promise.</p></li>\n<li><p>A <em>performative utterance</em> simultaneously describes and performs the act described.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I promise to repay you tomorrow\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, the person is promising, and not reporting about a promise. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to Searle's classification, speech acts can be categorized as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>Declarations</strong>: These are words and expressions that change the world by their very utterance, such as “I bet”, “I declare”, “I resign” or “I hereby pronounce you man and wife”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Representatives</strong>: These are acts in which the words state what the speaker believes to be the case, such as “describing”, “claiming”, “hypothesizing”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Commissives</strong>: This includes acts in which the words commit the speaker to future actions, such as “promising”, “offering”, “threatening”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Directives</strong>: This category covers acts in which the words are aimed at making the hearer do something, such as “commanding”, “requesting”, “inviting”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Expressives</strong>: This last group includes acts in which the words state what the speaker feels, such as “apologizing”, “praising”, “congratulating”.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Under Searle's classification, an oath or a promise are classified as <strong>commissive</strong>. Your example about the batter is classified as <strong>directive</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So when an utterance is performative, you basically <em>do things with words</em>, when it's constative, you just describe. Furthermore, performative verbs are those verbs which can make an utterance performative when used in a simple 1° person tense sentence, in all other cases the sentence stays constative.</p>\n\n<p>In a paper <a href=\"http://www.uqtr.ca/~vandervk/english_performative_verbs_ch6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Semantic analysis of English performative verbs</a>, \"agree\" is considered as capable of <em>acting</em> as a speech act verb:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The verb \"agree\" is both a propositional attitude and a speech act verb. One can be in the mental state of being in accord or agreement with someone without uttering any words. One can also agree verbally with someone by making the speech act of agreeing. In this illocutionary sense, to agree is to assert a proposition <em>P</em>  while presupposing (the preparatory condition) that other persons have previously put forward that proposition and while expressing (sincerity condition) one's accord or agreement with these persons as regards P.<br>\n  The person(s) with whom the speaker agrees may, but need not, be the hearer(s). One can say \"I agree with him that P\" as well as \"I agree with you that <em>P</em>.\" The contrary of \"agree\" is \"disagree\". To disagree is to assert a proposition with the preparatory condition that other \n  persons have previously put forward the negation of that proposition and the sincerity condition that one is in a state of disagreement with them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Still according to Searle, there is a general condition for all speech acts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The hearer must hear and understand the language, and the speaker must not be pretending or play-acting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if the speaker is lying, the verb is not a Speech Act one. </p>\n", "Id":"2918", "ParentId":"2917", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2012-12-01T19:29:52.190", "OwnerUserId":"111", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-02T00:33:16.270", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
