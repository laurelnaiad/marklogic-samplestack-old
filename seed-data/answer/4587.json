{"Body":"<p>Let me speak only about Thai language and what rules govern the loanwords. Other languages may well \"behave\" the other way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>is it generally true that the \"closest\" tones will be borrowed as well as the \"closest\" phonemes?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Short answer: <strong>Yes, but not always</strong> for phonemes; <strong>Usually No</strong> for tones.<br>\nI would also say that it's useful to know how words borrowed from <strong>non-tonal</strong> languages (English) change. It would highlight the things better.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Many words are borrowed along with their pronunciation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>บาร์บีคิว <code>[baː biː kʰiw]</code> <em>barbecue</em></li>\n<li>孔子 <code>[kʰʊŋ3 tsɨ3]</code> -- ขงจื๊อ <code>[kʰǒŋ tɕɯ́ː]</code> <em>Confucius, a philosopher</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...but sometimes not accurately. There are several reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Consonants are preserved in their <strong>written form</strong>, but pronounced according to the target language rules. This often happens to final consonants:\n<ul>\n<li><em>disco</em> ดิสโก <code>[dìt koː]</code>.<br>\nNote the tone appeared from nowhere and <code>s</code> in final position is read <code>t</code>.</li>\n<li><em>apple</em> แอปเปิ้ล <code>[ʔɛ̀ːp pɤ̂ːn]</code></li>\n<li><em>football</em> ฟุตบอล <code>[fút bɔːn]</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Tones may be totally missing:\n<ul>\n<li>叩头 <code>[kʰɤʊ̯4 tʰɤʊ̯2]</code> -- เข่าเท้า <code>[kʰàw tʰáːw]</code> <em>to bow one's head</em>. Note different vowel length and different tones: <code>[kʰɤʊ̯4 tʰɤʊ̯2]</code> is Falling+Rising, while <code>[kʰàw tʰáːw]</code> is Low+High. Different diphthongs must be fine since <code>[aːw]</code> seems to be closest to <code>[ɤʊ̯]</code>.</li>\n<li>老子 <code>[lɑʊ̯3 tsɨ3]</code> -- เล่าจื๊อ <code>[lâu tɕɯ́ː]</code> <em>Lao-Tze, a philosopher</em></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, more drastic changes happen when loanwords omit tone marks, so they have <strong>default tone</strong> governed by the initial consonant <sup>1</sup>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>カラオケ <code>[ka ra o ke]</code> คาราโอเกะ <code>[kʰaː raː oː kè]</code>, <em>karaoke</em>.<br>\nNote different vowel length and a Low tone for the last syllable.</li>\n<li>อินเทอร์เน็ต <code>[in tʰɤː nét]</code> <em>Internet</em>.<br>\nNote that due to vowel length, it sounds rather like \"inTERnet\", plus the last syllable has High tone.</li>\n<li>公司 <code>[kʊŋ1 sɨ1]</code> -- กงสี <code>[koŋ sǐː]</code> -- <em>company</em>.<br>\nDifferent vowels <code>[ɨ]</code> vs. <code>[iː]</code>, different length, and different tones: High+High tones vs. Mid+Rising</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All above applies per syllable, of course. If the word is polysyllabic, the same rules apply that govern polysyllabic words of Thai language (see <a href=\"http://www.thai-language.com/id/830222\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enepenthetic ‘Leading Consonant’ Clusters</a>).</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> In Thai language, each consonant belongs to <em>one of three consonant classes</em>. Each consonant class has been associated with a default tone, governed by live/dead syllable or long/short vowel.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, the summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consonants</strong> are often preserved in their written form;\n<ul>\n<li>And become governed by the target language rules;</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Vowels</strong> are more vulnerable for changes (than the consonants);</li>\n<li>Some loanwords attempt to keep original <strong>tone</strong>;\n<ul>\n<li>Often, it happens to be not very accurate;</li>\n<li>A large number of words do not retain the original tones;</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://sealang.net/thai/chinese/modern.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modern Chinese Loanwords in Thai</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"4587", "ParentId":"4585", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-09-28T16:54:23.387", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-01T19:12:21.050", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-01T19:12:21.050", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
