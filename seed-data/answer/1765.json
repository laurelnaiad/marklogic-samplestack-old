{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There's an excellent article at <a href=\"http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-complex-is-tangut.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Babelstone</a> that explains this in great detail.  (Kudos to @blunders for already mentioning it.)  I'll try to summarize their findings.</p>\n\n<p>Characters show up in several different ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Borrowing directly from Chinese for either meaning or sound.</li>\n<li>Deriving from Chinese by adding or removing a few strokes.</li>\n<li>Borrowing from other Chinese-family scripts.</li>\n<li>Inventing new characters unrelated to those in Chinese.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which methods were used most depends on the language.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Khitan</strong> is closest to Chinese, either borrowing or deriving most of its characters directly from Chinese.</li>\n<li><strong>Jurchen</strong> is a bit further away, deriving its characters from both Khitan and Chinese.  Jurchen rarely borrows directly from Chinese.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangut</strong> is the furthest -- it looks Chinese-ish, since it uses mostly the same types of strokes, but its characters are not clearly derived from either Chinese or Khitan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, I'd say Khitan is probably the most like Kanji in its relationship to Chinese.  Tangut seems more like Hangul: an independent writing system that, because of its place in the Chinese cultural sphere, was made to look more or less Chinese-ish.</p>\n", "Id":"1765", "ParentId":"818", "CreationDate":"2012-04-06T19:05:48.477", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"314", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-06T19:05:48.477", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://lumenaris.com", "Id":"314", "AccountId":"906180", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T02:55:28.507", "AboutMe":"<p>I play lots of games, develop a few.
