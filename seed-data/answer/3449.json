{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Hope all can agree that mistakes can be made at any level of proficiency. The level(s) of competence needed to make a reasonable claim for bi-/multilingualism are of course flexible but can to some degree be measured. One example is the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) but there are other applicable standards.</p>\n\n<p>As to the error rates based on the number of languages spoken, I guess you're referring to the speaker's best language(s). Errors made in a second(+) language would seem to only be a crude measure of how well that language is known. I haven't seen this precise question studied but it's somewhat similar to the question of whether bilingual children develop language skills later than their monolingual counterparts. It seems to have been the conventional wisdom that there is a delay but studies have not shown this conclusively. This of course doesn't mean that errors rates in primary language are also comparable but I would doubt that the effect is large.</p>\n", "Id":"3449", "ParentId":"3442", "CreationDate":"2013-03-28T18:11:46.920", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1767", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-28T18:11:46.920", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"24", "Location":"Sweden", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1767", "AccountId":"10219", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"212", "CreationDate":"2013-02-16T09:52:22.057", "DisplayName":"igelkott", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T12:53:17.277"}}
