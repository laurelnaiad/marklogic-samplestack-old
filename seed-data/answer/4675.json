{"Body":"<p>I'm don't think that the two examples you mention should be grouped together linguistically as a single class (to the exclusion of other activity verbs). </p>\n\n<p>Levin (1993) classes <em>teach</em> as a <em>verb of transfer of message</em>, along with <em>show, read, preach, etc.</em>. <em>verbs of transfer of message</em> are notable in that they participate in the dative alternation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1) John taught Mary the song.<br>\n  (2) John taught the song to Mary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Levin classes <em>cook</em> as a <em>build verb</em>, along with <em>arrange, bake, carve, chisel, etc.</em>. Such verbs are notable in that they participate in the following argument structure alternations: <em>The material/product alternation, total transformation alternation, unspecified object alternation, benefactive alternation, raw material subject alternation,</em> and <em>the sum of money subject alternation.</em> The example below is the <em>benefactive alternation</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(3) John baked Mary a cake.<br>\n  (4) John baked a cake for Mary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Cook</em> and <em>teach</em> are show very different behaviour. It's not even obvious to me that they belong to the same aspectual class. I don't see any reason why there should be a linguistic term to describe the conceit of 'activities accomplished by other activities'. As far as i can tell, there's no evidence to suggest that the distinction has any relevance to natural language semantics.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT</em>: Forgot to give the full citation for Levin.
