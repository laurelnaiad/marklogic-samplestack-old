Chomsky was wrong. I want to know how recursion spread from Greece through the old world, and it seems we will find out. I am also curious about simpler examples of recursion, like list making.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly blindly follow Gell-Mann and agree with Joseph Greenberg about superfamilies and mass-comparison. I don't see any reason that the mass-comparison method cannot be made rigorous with good statistics.</p>\n\n<p>I like formal grammars, and I don't believe I understand something unless I can program a computer to understand it the same as me. My linguistic goal today is to write a good English parser. I think I can do at least marginally better than current parsers, which seem to be weighed down with theoretical cruft. Maybe it'll read a newspaper, maybe not. I hope to find out soon enough.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"New York City", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"92", "Reputation":"481", "DisplayName":"Ron Maimon", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-02T00:11:46.293"}}
