The book I suspect you are thinking of is <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226468046\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women, Fire and Dangerous Things</a>. In it, in Chapter 6, there is also a short discussion of a single Japanese counter, <em>hon</em> (which is used to count long thing things such as sticks, pencils, rivers, phone calls, ball game hits &amp; pitches and dried snakes) and how these categorize how these are in some respects metaphors for how one thinks about the world.  </p>\n", "Id":"291", "ParentId":"280", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T14:35:44.773", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"117", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-19T14:35:44.773", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "Location":"Denver, CO", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"117", "AccountId":"46214", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"609", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T13:41:53.967", "DisplayName":"Tangurena", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-09T17:10:34.627", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a .NET developer.</p>\n"}}
