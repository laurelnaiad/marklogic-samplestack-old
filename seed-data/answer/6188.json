It really means \"twice pairwise\", \"twice in pair\", but isn't that the same as \"two pairs\", <code>::</code>?</p>\n\n<p><code>Bina</code> is plural of the word <code>bini</code> (pair), so the verb <code>sunt</code> is plural. I would translate the Latin sentence as \"Two pairs make four.\"</p>\n", "Id":"6188", "ParentId":"6187", "CreationDate":"2013-12-18T11:02:07.940", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2689", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-18T11:02:07.940", "CommentCount":"7"}
