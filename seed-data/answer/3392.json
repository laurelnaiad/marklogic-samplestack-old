{"Body":"<p>Mine is also a partial answer. I'm not commenting on the etymology of the Greek words in your question.</p>\n\n<p>In Attic Greek ἱερός, there's a diacritic over iota (in some other dialects there was psilosis, or h-dropping). It's called \"rough breathing\" (Lat. spiritus asper; Greek δασὺ πνεῦμα). Usually, Anlaut (word-initial) spiritus asper in Greek corresponds to PIE *s.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Greek ἱερός, it's a different story. Sihler 1995 argues that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Initial /h/ sometimes results from the anticipation of an intervocalic /h/ from -s-. (§174.2)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's also another rule here: an intervocalic *s was lost in Greek (*s>*h>0) (Sihler 1995, §172).</p>\n", "Id":"3392", "ParentId":"3389", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2013-03-16T21:54:04.577", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-16T22:39:53.410", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-16T22:39:53.410", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
