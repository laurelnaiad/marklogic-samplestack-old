{"Body":"<p>My opinion is that it depends on what counts as a word. However extensive the English vocabulary is, technically it consists of separate items, each one of them having a large number of meanings. We can learn, say, 500 English words to talk on any subject. The grammar is relatively simple, with a small amount of regular words.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking on regularity; are French <em>ir/je vai/allez</em>,  or Spanish <em>ir/yiendo/vaya</em>, two sets of three different words, or are they just two paradigms for <em>ir</em> in two languages?</p>\n\n<p>Is Lakota <em>Waŋyáŋkiŋ...</em> for 'you take a look at it' a single word or a phrase?</p>\n\n<p>There are also languages with 'targeted vocabularies', where lexical items have less meaninings than in English (e.g. Russian, French, Spanish or Finnish) and the lexical stock is bigger even for high-frequency items.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are languages with targeted vocabularies and word-merging alchemy producing a new word, e.g. Finnish 'tie' (way) +-to-suffix does not equal 'the way done', but 'knowledge', and 'tieto' plus 'kone' (machine) does not equal 'knowledge machine', but 'computer'. Or 'kilpi' (shield)  plus 'konna' (toad) does not mean 'a shield toad', or 'a toad shield', but simply 'a turtle'. </p>\n\n<p>So, as far as a unique lexical combination is concerned as a separate word, my guess is that of all the languages I am familiar with, Finnish has the biggest vocabulary.</p>\n", "Id":"3394", "ParentId":"3393", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-03-17T18:19:23.180", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-17T21:15:11.020", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
