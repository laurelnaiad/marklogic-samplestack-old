{"Body":"<p>The most famous example of a phenomenon which seems to argue against the context-freeness of natural language is cross-serial dependencies in Swiss German (<a href=\"http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schieber, '85</a>) (cross-serial dependencies can also be found in Dutch).</p>\n\n<p>Two facts about Swiss German are relevant here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Objects are case-marked (dative and accusative), diff. verbs sub-categorise for objects with different case-marking.</li>\n<li>Subordinate clauses allow a cross-serial order.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's the pertinent data. I'll just give the English gloss, see the linked-to paper for details:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(a) ...Jan said that we Hans.DAT1 [the house].ACC2 helped1 paint2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note the cross-serial dependencies; <strong>Hans</strong> is the object of <strong>helped</strong>, and <strong>the house</strong> is the object of <strong>paint</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Now onto the proof that a context-free grammar can't handle cross-serial dependencies. This is going to be fairly sloppy, but bear in mind that this is an established result in the literature.</p>\n\n<p>We're going to give a proof by contradiction, so let's assume that the <em>L</em> (Swiss German) <strong>is</strong> context free. Therefore the intersection of a regular language with the image of <em>L</em> under a homomorphism must be context free as well. Now consider the following grammatical Swiss German example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(b) Jan said that we [the children].ACC1 Hans.DAT2 house.ACC have\n  wanted let1 help2 paint</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The &lt; NP, V > pairs &lt; the children, let > and &lt; Hans, help > can both be iterated.</p>\n\n<p>The following homomorphism <em>f</em> seperates the iterated NPs and Vs in (b) from the surrounding material:</p>\n\n<p><em>f(the children) = a</em><br>\n<em>f(Hans) = b</em><br>\n<em>f(let) = c</em><br>\n<em>f(help) = d</em><br>\n<em>f(Jan said that we) = w</em><br>\n<em>f(house have wanted) = x</em><br>\n<em>f(painted) = y</em><br>\n<em>f(s) = z otherwise</em>  </p>\n\n<p>The images we are interested in under f are of the form <em>wV1xV2y</em>, where V1 contains <em>as</em> and <em>bs</em>, and V2 contains <em>cs</em> and <em>ds</em>, and if the <em>kth</em> element in V1 is an <em>a</em> (a <em>b</em> resp.), then the <em>kth</em> element in V2 is a <em>c</em> (a <em>d</em> resp.) - i.e., sentences involving cross-serial dependencies. All other sentences have a <em>z</em> somewhere in their image under f. To make sure we only concentrate on constructions involving cross-serial dependencies, we intersect <em>f(L)</em> with the reg. language <em>wa*b*xc*d*y</em>, giving us <em>L'</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If <em>L</em> is context free, then <em>L'</em> must be too. If this is so, then the image of <em>L'</em> under a homomorphism <em>f'</em> with <em>f(w)=f'(x)=f'(y)= ∆ê, f'(a)=a, f'(b)=b, f'(c)=c, f'(d)=d</em> will also be context free. This image is:</p>\n\n<p><em>f'(L') = L'' = { a^i b^j c^i d^j | i, j >= 0 }</em></p>\n\n<p><em>L''</em> should satisfy the pumping lemma for context free languages. Inspecting the word <em>{a^k b^k c^k d^k}</em>, where k is the constant from the pumping lemma however, this can be shown to lead to a contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion L'' is not context free, and neither is L' nor L. The take-home message is that purely context-free grammars cannot handle cross-serial dependencies in natural languages - although examples of this are few and far between.
