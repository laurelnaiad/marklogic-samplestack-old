I myself (a linguist) would call such a system an open-ended numeral system. Rather than describing what a language can't do, we normally describe what it does, so we talk about a language having a system for expressing numerals up to a certain point. I've worked on languages that have an upper limit of 3, and on one that had an upper limit of 99 (ie no word for 100).</p>\n\n<p>BTW, English doesn't really have words for all numbers, there's always an upper limit, so while there is a technical jargon in mathematics for referring to any number, everyday English does not have names for every number.</p>\n", "Id":"649", "ParentId":"648", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T13:15:45.620", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-02T13:15:45.620", "CommentCount":"11"}
