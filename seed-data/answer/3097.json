I preferred simple CSV files, that I could open in a spreadsheet (LibreOffice).</p>\n\n<p>If you have one sentence per line, and ask annotators to fill in the categories in the next column, it is quite easy to collect all the annotations and merge them into one file, such that each annotator's input goes into a unique column. You can either merge them all using a spreadsheet, or write a simple script (shell, perl, python, etc.) for the task.</p>\n\n<p>Some tips:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if you only have one category per sentence, and if your categories are <code>economics</code>, <code>sports</code>, <code>science</code>, and <code>life</code>, I recommend entering it as <code>1economics</code>, <code>2sports</code>, <code>3science</code>, and <code>4life</code> in the spreadsheet. The user has to type only the first character, and autocomplete will do the rest.</li>\n<li>if you need more than one category per sentence, I think the annotator would find it quicker to enter numbers like <code>12</code>, <code>134</code>, etc. However, autocomplete would be useless for this.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"3097", "ParentId":"3095", "CreationDate":"2013-01-20T19:44:34.387", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-20T19:44:34.387", "CommentCount":"5"}
