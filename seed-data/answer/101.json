The fact that one language has been significantly influenced by other languages from other families does not change its origin. It may change some core aspects of the language, but it remains Semitic.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing could apply to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gypsy language</a> - it has many forms in different countries that are heavily influenced - both lexically and grammatically - by the \"host\" country languages, however the gypsy language remains of Indic origin.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting, related case is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balkan language area</a>. Romanian, for example, has taken a lot of features from Slavic languages, but it is still Romance language.</p>\n\n<p>To conclude - In my opinion changes in the language should not be taken into account when genealogy is concerned.</p>\n", "Id":"101", "ParentId":"89", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T11:10:12.323", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"80", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T11:10:12.323", "CommentCount":"3"}
