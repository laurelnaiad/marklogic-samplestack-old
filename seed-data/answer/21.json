{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Different languages produce their vowels at different positions in the mouth. For example while English distinguishes two different a sounds (those in \"lard\" and those in \"gaunt\"), German has only one, which is actually positioned between the other two. However, unless you are an advanced speaker of a different language, your ears will not expect to hear this non-English a and instead try to file it as one of the a's that you know.</p>\n\n<p>That is also why people have accents. Their tongues and ears are not used to the other sounds and often they might not even be aware of a difference between the foreign sound and a similar one in their own language. Trouble is, even though it might be similar, it's not the same, and native speakers of the other language can usually tell (because the sound is not exactly what their ears expected).</p>\n\n<p>I'd say, to a degree it could thus be possible to determine someone's origin from what sounds they are able to discern. It would not be failsafe however, as you also have to take into consideration what accents and foreign languages the person knows to which degree. Finding things that the person cannot distinguish would thus give better feedback as finding things the person can distinguish.</p>\n", "Id":"21", "ParentId":"8", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T22:06:24.820", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"57", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-13T22:06:24.820", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"57", "AccountId":"523841", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"166", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:28:45.257", "DisplayName":"Marc Schulder", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-14T16:06:40.290"}}
