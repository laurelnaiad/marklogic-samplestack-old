{"Body":"<p>Frank Blair's 1990 book \"Survey on a Shoestring: A Manual for Small-Scale Language Surveys\" gives a model for how to do this kind of analysis &ndash; it's the best non-computer based process I've found so far, although it does have limitations it its rather brute-force method. You might find some people who have used this method by checking who's cite Blair. I used this process in Lauren Gawne (2010) \"<a href=\"http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/nepling/pdf/Nep_Ling_25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lamjung Yolmo: a dialect of Yolmo, also known as Helambu Sherpa</a>\" in Nepalese Linguistics, which is available online. This kind of process requires you to decide how you're dealing with tone, and closely related sounds so it's best to check people's methodology. </p>\n\n<p>This kind of process is useful for determining how phonetically related two dialects, or closely related languages are. If you have more than two languages like I did in that paper this may help in establishing the historical relationship between groups of languages.  </p>\n", "Id":"605", "ParentId":"169", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T23:55:53.653", "OwnerUserId":"64", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-26T15:46:18.037", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
