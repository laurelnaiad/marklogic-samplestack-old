{"Body":"<p>Well, that's not the only way to look at the phenomenon, and it's not necessary<br>\nto believe that there are gaps like black holes left in sentences or anything like that.<br>\nBut there's a point it makes.</p>\n\n<p>There are two great families of pronouns, both descending from Proto-Indo-European roots:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Demonstrative pronouns and their allies, descended from the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080628043014/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE534.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">PIE root <strong>*<em>to-</em></strong></a><br>\nIn English these start with <strong>TH</strong>: <em>there, that, thither, thence, then, this, thus, though, the, they,</em> etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Relative and interrogative pronouns and their allies, descended from the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080628043014/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE258.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">PIE root <strong>*<em>k ∑o-</em></strong></a><br>\nIn English these start with <strong>WH</strong>: <em>where, what, whither, whence, when, how, who, why, whether,</em> etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So if <em>that</em> is a relative pronoun, it's an odd one.  </p>\n\n<p>The thing is that <em>that</em> has been used for over 600 years to introduce tensed subordinate clauses.<br>\nAnd it still is used that way for two out of the three kinds of subordinate clauses in Modern English.<br>\nTensed Noun clauses and Adjective clauses require or allow <em>that</em>, under varying rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Mary believes [<strong>that</strong> [the Earth is an oblate spheroid]].</em> [Complement (Noun) clause]  </li>\n<li><em>The man [<strong>that</strong> [Mary talked to]] didn't believe her</em>. [Relative (Adjective) clause]  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tensed Adverb clauses don't allow it any more, though they used to in Chaucer's day:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>When he gets here, be sure to offer him a drink.</em>  (grammatical without <em>that</em>)</li>\n<li>*<em>When that he gets here, be sure to offer him a drink.</em>  (ungrammatical with <em>that</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But compare the first line of Chaucer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Whan <strong>that</strong> aprill with his shoures soote the droghte of march hath perced to the roote</em><br>\n'When (*that) April with its showers sweet the drought of March has pierced to the root'</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now the kind of word that introduces a clause and doesn't have meaning as such \nis a <strong>Complementizer</strong>. Clearly this is the right term for the <em>that</em> in <em>that the Earth is an oblate spheroid</em>.<br>\nAnd it's obvious that it's the term for the way Chaucer used it, too.  </p>\n\n<p>So the question is, what is it when it heads a relative clause?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If <em>that</em> is a relative pronoun, then there are a lot of questions that need answering:<br>\n  Why is <em>that</em> so different from the other relative pronouns?<br>\n  Why is <em>that</em> optional in restrictive relatives but forbidden in non-restrictive ones?<br>\n  Why can <em>that</em> be used in any kind of clause, where WH relatives are specific to person, time, etc?<br>\n  Why is it being used as a relative pronoun when it's already used as a complementizer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If <em>that</em> is a complementizer in relative clauses, then these questions evaporate.<br>\n  What appears then is a situation similar to complement clauses. \n  <em>That</em> may be deleted in complements, just as it can be in relative clauses, and under the same conditions<br>\n  -- whenever it's not needed to mark the subordinate clause as a subordinate clause, it's optional.</p>\n  \n  <p>This also solves all coreference problems, because complementizers are not referential.<br>\n  Therefore if there is any coreference in the relative clause, it is coreference of the sort called \"understood\" (also, \"deleted\", \"a gap\", \"zero\", \"Pro\" (of two varieties), or some other term, depending usually on what year your syntax instructor got their PhD).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's what they really mean, I think. There's quite a lot more one could say on the topic,<br>\nbut I forbear.</p>\n", "Id":"5956", "ParentId":"5955", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2013-11-21T04:54:15.470", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-24T16:20:31.050", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
