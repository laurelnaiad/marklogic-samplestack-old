{"Body":"<p>I'm surprised that neither of the current answers makes reference to what exactly the Pinyin phonetically transcribes.</p>\n\n<p>The name of the city, romanised in Pinyin as <em>kun1ming2</em>, is pronounced [ku̯ən˥ miŋ˧˥]. As hippietrail correctly notes, there is a semi-vowel in medial position in the onset.</p>\n\n<p>hippietrail's transcription of 'kweeming' reflects the semi-vowel in the onset, plus the assimilation of the [n] in the first syllable to the following [m].</p>\n\n<p>The reason for the confusion is that Pinyin rimes aren't meant to correspond directly to English orthography. This is why a Pinyin syllable like <em>yuan</em> is mispronounced by virtually every English speaker, where a correct transcription might be [yɛn].</p>\n\n<p>In particular, there's a quirk of Pinyin regarding syllables with the nucleus [u̯ə]. In Pinyin, this diphthong is transcribed <code>un</code> (<code>kun</code>, <code>sun</code> etc) except when the initial is zero, when it's transcribed <code>wen</code>. This quirk of Pinyin may be responsible for your question — perhaps its pronunciation would be less surprising if Kunming was instead transcribed <code>Kwenming</code>, as would be the case if this quirk didn't exist!</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, you've encountered one of the quirks which make it hard for a naive English speaker to approximate Mandarin based on the Pinyin; although Pinyin uses Roman letters, the values diverge considerably.</p>\n", "Id":"4843", "ParentId":"4832", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "CreationDate":"2013-11-03T11:27:59.997", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-04T04:28:12.607", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
