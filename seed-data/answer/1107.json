{"Body":"<p>Phonetics isn't my forte, so I don't follow literature on phonetics and I might be wrong. Here's my guess. An affricate is a stop followed by a fricative, homo- or heterorganic (same or different place of articulation). The tip of the tongue is retracted (moved back) for \"t/d\" in anticipation of the following \"r\". In fact, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=QRpw_igmHnkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">O'Connor 1994</a> argues that it is on the front of the hard palate. See below what he says:</p>\n\n<p>tr: \"the tongue is in position for the friction of /r/.\"</p>\n\n<p>dr: \"there is friction as the voiced air passes over the tongue-tip for the /r/.\"</p>\n", "Id":"1107", "ParentId":"1104", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2011-12-02T02:08:39.803", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-02T18:19:27.537", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-02T18:19:27.537", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
