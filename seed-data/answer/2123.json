(*<em>This one is bedder</em> for \"This one is more of a bed\".  *<em>I'm sleepering/sleepinger</em> for \"I'm sleeping more\".)</li>\n<li>Adjectives do not take verbal inflection. (*<em>I badded</em>, *<em>I'm badding</em> for \"I was/am being bad\".)</li>\n<li>Adjectives do not take nominal inflection. (Reprising the example from your response to Gaston Ümlaut, one says <em>the poor</em> not *<em>the poors</em>.)</li>\n<li>Adjectives are subject to ordering restrictions (<em>I love small yellow tomatoes</em> not *<em>I love yellow small tomatoes</em>).  Such restrictions vanish if the adjectives are replaced with nominal or verbal \"counterparts\" (e.g., <em>I love these tomatoes for their smallness and yellowness / for their yellowness and smallness</em>; <em>I love that these tomatoes are small and yellow / are yellow and small</em>.)</li>\n<li>There are various constructions in which only adjectives are licit.  (E.g., <em>So friendly a cat</em>, but *<em>So friend (of) a cat</em> and *<em>So befriend (of) a cat</em>.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Well, those are a few criteria from off the top of my head, some morphological, some syntactico-semantic.  There are doubtless more.  </p>\n", "Id":"2123", "ParentId":"2117", "CreationDate":"2012-06-17T15:21:38.833", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1110", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-17T15:21:38.833", "CommentCount":"5"}
