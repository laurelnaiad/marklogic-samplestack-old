For all of the 19th Century, every linguist in the world (which principally meant Europe, in this case) was busily engaged in bringing <em>Ordnung</em> to the prehistory of the Indo-European languages.</p>\n\n<p>In the century since, this immense scholarly undertaking has been codified and turned into individual etymologies, which are normally looked up in a principal source, like Pokorny's <em><a href=\"http://dnghu.org/indoeuropean.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indo-European Etymological Dictionary</a></em>. To make sense of these, you need some linguistic training.</p>\n\n<p>There are secondary sources available that skip a lot of details but still do the job. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Buck's monumental <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226079376\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages: A Contribution to the History of Ideas</a></em> is now available in paperback. It's organized like a thesaurus, in 21 chapters by topic (<strong>4.</strong> <em>Parts of the Body</em>; <strong>8.</strong> <em>Agriculture, Vegetation</em>; <strong>15.</strong> <em>Sense Perception</em>), and in each chapter about a hundred or two ideas -- like <em>head</em> (<strong>4.20</strong>), <em>rose</em> (<strong>8.58</strong>), <em>restore</em> (<strong>11.23</strong>), or <em>good smelling, fragrant</em> (<strong>15.25</strong>) -- are given with a list of synonyms and a discussion of the roots involved and the history of the words and concept in different languages. This is a fascinating book to dip into anywhere; Buck really meant his subtitle -- the first sentence in his <em>Preface</em> is \"How do we get our ideas?\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Watkins' <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0618082506\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots</a></em> was compiled specifically for the words in the unabridged American Heritage dictionary, but they cite Pokorny and have illustrative examples.</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"1278", "ParentId":"1277", "CreationDate":"2012-01-14T16:36:18.763", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-14T16:36:18.763", "CommentCount":"7"}
