{"Body":"<p>You might enjoy a 2005 <a href=\"http://emeld.org/school/classroom/text/lexicon-size.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">web publication by Johanna Nichols</a>, which discusses what one can expect to learn about a language, given the size of the available corpus. </p>\n\n<p>In my particular experience, the most efficient situation is where one has a fair-sized text corpus along with follow-up elicitation based on patterns encountered in the text. Having a purely text-based corpus makes the number of words required considerably larger. For one project I've worked on, with a ~280,000 word corpus with free translations and no supporting materials, myself and my colleagues could cover all of the basic topics in a grammatical description. A current project has a corpus of ~35,000 words with extensive notes from follow-up elicitation, and I'd consider the potential coverage better, but not by much, than for the language with the larger corpus.</p>\n", "Id":"2695", "ParentId":"2679", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "CreationDate":"2012-10-14T04:10:40.260", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-14T04:16:57.117", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-14T04:16:57.117", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
