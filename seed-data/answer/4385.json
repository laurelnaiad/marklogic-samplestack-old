So, by way of an answer to your question: <strong>Georgian stress-assignment is partially rule governed</strong>. Applying the rules helps, but since at least one of the rules is disjunctive, stress assignment must be partially lexicalised.</p>\n", "Id":"4385", "ParentId":"4384", "CreationDate":"2013-09-04T12:29:16.763", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-04T12:29:16.763", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
