{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Anecdotal here, but when I was in school in the late 1990's/early 2000's we spent a day or two on these once, although I can't remember what grade it was or who the teacher was (a lot of my English teachers were older, so they might have had to learn it in the 40's or 50's when they were in school). I remember thinking they were kind of cool but kind of confusing, and most kids had a really hard time with them. </p>\n\n<p>Judging from the difficulty many Intro Ling students have with identifying things like prepositions and determiners/articles, my sense is that this type of stuff isn't really taught now in the K-12 system, unless it's on some state standardized test or the SAT. It seems to me most of the test-prep is centered on vocabulary words, particularly low-frequency ones.</p>\n", "Id":"6127", "ParentId":"6048", "CreationDate":"2013-12-13T01:55:03.043", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2838", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-13T01:55:03.043", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2838", "AccountId":"3697576", "CreationDate":"2013-12-07T20:18:53.400", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"26", "Location":"California", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"11", "DisplayName":"wugology", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-12T07:26:37.063"}}
