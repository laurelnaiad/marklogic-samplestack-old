If in hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies children take parents/grandparents as their linguistic models right through the acquisition process, then this would produce a pattern of language change in which slow, steady incremental change would dominate. (Though this basic pattern would be later subject to processes of linguistic diffusion through contact with other groups.)</p>\n\n<p>In urban environments, however, there are larger groups of children and adolescents living in the same settlement. In some cases they may take their age-peers as linguistic models from a relatively young age, which might be expected to accelerate changes in process.</p>\n\n<p>On change by incrementation and diffusion, see: Labov (2007), “Transmission and Diffusion.”</p>\n\n<p>For an example of urban language change breaking with the normal incrementation pattern, because of different socialisation patterns, see: Cheshire et al.
