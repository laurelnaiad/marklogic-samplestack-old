Chinese has undergone some severe sound changes going from Middle Chinese to modern Mandarin. There is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den\">a famous poem</a> constructed in Classical Chinese so that when pronounced in Mandarin, all the words are [ʂʐ̩], with varying tones. The Wikipedia page linked to also gives pronunciations in the other varieties of Chinese; the number of syllables distinguished in Cantonese is closest to the number distinguished in Middle Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>So how has Chinese coped in the face of such homophony? Well, in Mandarin, one notices that there are more polysyllabic common words than in other dialects (or, indeed, Classical Chinese): homophonous monosyllabic words were replaced by compound words in order to disambiguate. For example, the word for ‘tooth’ in Mandarin is 牙齒 [ja˧˥tʂʰʐ̩˨˩˦], ostensibly a compound of 牙 (‘tooth’) and 齒 (‘tooth’); in Cantonese, the word is just 牙 [ŋɐː˧˩]. This happens in English too, as JSBᾶngs points out.</p>\n", "Id":"416", "ParentId":"55", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T13:30:06.853", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"252", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-22T13:30:06.853", "CommentCount":"1"}
