{"Body":"<p>The examples you give are actually of different origin. \"Au\" as you have stated correctly is a high German (i.e. southern German) variant of \"Aue\" derived from old high German \"ouwe\", which denotates a lower place near water. But in case of Oberammergau the ending is actually \"Gau\", which is derived from old high German \"gouwe\", which means something like area, territory or governmental district.</p>\n\n<p>And the name Passau seems to be derived from roman \"Batavis\", which was a roman name for a germanic tribe. How the derivation process changed \"Batavis\" into \"Passau\", I don't know.</p>\n", "Id":"3961", "ParentId":"3960", "LastEditorUserId":"2212", "CreationDate":"2013-07-03T20:16:46.813", "OwnerUserId":"2212", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-03T20:40:56.110", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ephemeroid.net", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2212", "AccountId":"2115029", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"181", "CreationDate":"2013-07-01T13:21:00.843", "DisplayName":"bouscher", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-28T14:48:39.763", "AboutMe":"<p>Well, it's just me, that may not be much, but it's all I got.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-03T20:40:56.110", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ephemeroid.net", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2212", "AccountId":"2115029", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"181", "CreationDate":"2013-07-01T13:21:00.843", "DisplayName":"bouscher", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-28T14:48:39.763", "AboutMe":"<p>Well, it's just me, that may not be much, but it's all I got.</p>\n"}}
