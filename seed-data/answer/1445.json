{"Body":"<p>I have probably turned myself into a machine, but the sentences</p>\n\n<pre><code>I was driving against the traffic towards London.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code>I was driving, against the traffic, towards London.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>mean very different things to me, and each has an unambiguous meaning -- not just in text (with punctuation) but in speech too (with intonation).</p>\n\n<p>I have pasted a couple of graphs below. To make these, I fed the sentences to the Stanford Parser and used my own software to generate the graphs. But you can verify it for yourself  at <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/index.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Stanford Parser's demo website</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDxPs.png\" alt=\"I was driving against the traffic towards London.\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MSaTH.png\" alt=\"I was driving, against the traffic, towards London.\"></p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that most parsers (and I <code>:-D</code>) tend to treat these in a manner identical to the Stanford Parser, I do not claim that most speakers of English would see this difference between these sentences.</p>\n\n<p>@FumbleFingers: I don't know about a UK/US difference in this case, but having done classes in linguistics with a few classmates from the US, I have come to the opinion that in matters of <em>subtle</em> interpretation, not all people from the same region tend to have the same opinions. How do <em>you</em> interpret the first sentence? How do you interpret it in speech? Do your RL friends from your region interpret it your way too?</p>\n", "Id":"1445", "ParentId":"1436", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2012-02-17T20:20:45.597", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-17T22:30:03.163", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-17T22:30:03.163", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
