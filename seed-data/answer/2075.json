This name avoidance (or taboo) practice includes words which are phonologically similar to a deceased person's name, which can result in words in common use also becoming taboo. These taboo words are typically replaced by some other word, or perhaps by one borrowed from another language. These replacement words are used as total synonyms of the word they replace.</p>\n\n<p>An example of this is given in Dixon (1980:29), involving the death of a man named <em>Ngayunya</em>. This led to proscription of the first singular pronoun <em>ngayu</em> and its replacement with <em>nganku</em>, drawn from the mother-in-law avoidance speech style. As the death name taboo applies most particularly to speech with, and in the presence of, relatives of the deceased, both terms were at all times in use by at least some members of the community.</p>\n", "Id":"2075", "ParentId":"2062", "CreationDate":"2012-06-08T08:51:50.887", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-08T08:51:50.887", "CommentCount":"2"}
