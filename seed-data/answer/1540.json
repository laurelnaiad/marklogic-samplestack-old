{"Body":"<p>You've constructed your query a bit tendentiously, I think.</p>\n\n<p>First there's the phrase \"and for which the correctness of the analysis is generally accepted within the tradition\".  So if someone comes with an example, you can always dip into the vast literature of linguists exploring alternatives to each other's ideas - to characterize the example as not \"generally accepted\".  </p>\n\n<p>Then there's the reference to \"FLN\", which will allow you to reject all sorts of examples for which there isn't an analysis compatible with Chomsky's recent hyper-minmalist speculation that the only component of UG is Merge (i.e. FLN).  Chomsky may be famous, but these recent speculations do not drive the field - precisely because it is so hard to explain anything real within their strictures. (Some people might find this a bracing challenge, but the other possibility is that it's a blind alley.)</p>\n\n<p>Then there's your reference to \"domain-specific\".  No one's going to be able to <em>prove</em> that a principle relevant to grammar might not turn out to be domain-general.  Maybe the Case Filter reflects some abstract property of the mind that is also used in vision. That would actually be a very exciting result for everyone, generative grammarians included. My point (I'm the author of the quote) is that I've never seen any demonstration of this sort that's real, not that we know for a fact that the principles underlying human language are all domain-specific.</p>\n\n<p>That said, have a go at:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>the existence of obligatory verb-initial and obligatory verb-second languages, and the non-existence of obligatory verb-third, verb-fourth, etc. languages</p></li>\n<li><p>the Cinque hierarchy</p></li>\n<li><p>the complement/non-complement asymmetry in Incorporation and compounding (Baker's standard example)</p></li>\n<li><p>island conditions as they apply to wh-phrases like \"why\" and \"how\", both overtly displaced and in situ</p></li>\n<li><p>The Person-Case Constraint</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are examples that come to my mind.
