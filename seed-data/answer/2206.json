You may notice that children like their caretakers to read them the same story each night, and modern children like to watch the same movie again and again. My theory for why they like this is that they like hearing the story or watching the movie because they are able to understand what is being said, whereas just listening to ambient conversation of adults much of it goes over their heads. So according to my theory, you can do it, and the way to do it is to watch the Norwegian version of The Little Mermaid, or Sesame Street, every day for one month, and maybe sing along. After a year or so of this you can switch over to slightly more challenging programs which still have clear speech, then go on to films for regular adults.</p>\n", "Id":"2206", "ParentId":"1792", "CreationDate":"2012-07-04T02:35:19.250", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-04T02:35:19.250", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
