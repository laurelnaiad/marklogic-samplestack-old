{"Body":"<p>Word final consonants in French <em>are</em> pronounced, but only under certain conditions that has to do with group- or phrase phonology; they are usually not pronounced at the end of a phrase or a word uttered in isolation. </p>\n\n<p>Descriptions of late 17th century French suggest a stage where most consonants were (still) pronounced, but some were elided mainly before other consonants.\nThese elisions eliminated some consonant clusters inside word groups.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Modern French</strong></p>\n\n<p>Word-final consonants <em>are</em> pronounced when the next word starts in a vowel in certain groups, the phenomenon known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_%28French%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">liaison</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Liaison is considered obligatory within some groups, eg between article and adjective/noun </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>les enfants /lez‿ɑ̃.fɑ̃/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>between subject/object pronoun and verb (or verb followed by subject/object pronoun) </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>nous avons /nu.z‿a.vɔ̃/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>but <strong>not</strong> between phrases, eg between a subject noun and verb</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mes amis arrivent /me.z‿a.mi (*.z‿) a.ʁiv/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Late 17th Century French</strong></p>\n\n<p>Contemporary descriptions of 'good' pronunciation emphasize cases <strong>when word final consonants are elided</strong> and not pronounced, i.e. the reverse of modern descriptions. </p>\n\n<p>An example from <em>L'art de prononcer parfaitement la langue françoise</em> (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=QJQPAAAAQAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">1689</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"<em>il fait, on lit, vous dites, les mains, vos parens</em>, qu'on prononce à peu près comme s'il y avoit, <em>ifai, onli, voudite, lémains, vauparans</em>.\" (p 101)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like in modern French in these examples the final consonant of a pronoun/article before another consonant was not pronounced, but (group) final -s had not yet been generally dropped:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>le(<em>s</em>) mains, vo(<em>s</em>) parens </p></li>\n<li><p>vous(<em>s</em>) dite(s)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Like in modern French (group) final -t in these examples was dropped, and unlike the 'l' of il is also elided before a consonant.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>on fai(t)</p></li>\n<li><p>i(<em>l</em>) fai(t)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These examples suggest that <strong>consontants were elided first inside specific word groups</strong> to simplify clusters, eg from |vousdites > voudites|, |ilfait > ifait|, before they were elided anywhere else. Most of these elisions also apply for modern French, but some have been reversed like in the case of 'il fait.'</p>\n\n<p>Compare <em>La Génie de la langue françoise (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=sTY5RgcVDGAC\" rel=\"nofollow\">1684</a></em>) which has this to say about word final -f:</p>\n\n<p><ul>\n<li>F is <em>always pronounced</em> in</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"..<em>Bref, chef, fief, grief, nef, esquif, if</em>, arbre; <em>Iuif, motif, naïf, tarif, vif: nominatif, genetif</em>, &amp;c, <em>indicatif, subjonctif,</em> &amp;c, <em>neuf</em>, de <em>novus</em>.\" [p20]</li>\n  </ul>\n  But</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>F is <em>only pronounced</em> before vowels, and at the end of a line of verse or phrase (period) in these words:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"..<em>bœuf</em>, <em>œuf</em>, <em>neuf</em>, de <em>novem</em>. On dit <em>un œu dure</em>; <em>du bœu salé</em>; <em>neu soldats</em>\". [p20]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So at this point in time for some words the -f was never elided, but for some it was elided but only before consonant in the same group, 'bœuf' (beef) but 'bœusalé' (salted beef), 'neuf' (nine) but 'neusoldats' (nine soldiers).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>F is not pronouced before plural s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Au pluriel on prononce toûjours <em>des grièz</em>, du singulier <em>grief</em>: &amp; <em>des bœus</em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly most of the words the first group - where -f is never elided - are adjectives, and would most commonly occurs as the final word in their group. The elisions in the second group are not current in modern French, but some elisions before plural are, 17 Cent 'bœus' for \"bœufs\" is today 'bœu' since plural -s is now generally dropped.</p>\n", "Id":"6184", "ParentId":"2632", "LastEditorUserId":"363", "CreationDate":"2013-12-17T23:36:48.357", "OwnerUserId":"2708", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-27T22:26:31.613", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ümlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-27T22:26:31.613", "Score":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"122", "Location":"South Carolina", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2708", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/100002552955579/picture?type=large", "AccountId":"3562877", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"353", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T20:18:34.430", "DisplayName":"Mario Elocio", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:34:20.273"}}
