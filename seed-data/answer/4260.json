{"Body":"<p><em>Mother</em> is not the antonym of <em>father</em>. They are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernym\" rel=\"nofollow\">co-hyponyms</a> because they are both a kind of <em>parent</em> - and <em>parent</em> is the hypernym of <em>mother</em> and <em>father</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Antonymy is the relation that holds between <em>parent</em> and <em>child</em>. So by extension the antonym of <em>mother</em> could be said to be <em>child</em>.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: After reading hippietrail's answer, I somewhat changed my opinion. If one considers two words to be antonyms already if just one of their semantic features is replaced with the opposite then <em>mother</em> (female parent) and <em>father</em> (male parent) can be said to be antonyms. However, I feel that it might make sense to reserve antonymy for complete negation or oppositeness, and describe the relation between <em>mother</em> and <em>father</em> as hyponymy.</p>\n", "Id":"4260", "ParentId":"4258", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "CreationDate":"2013-08-26T11:45:47.627", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-28T16:47:12.950", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-28T16:47:12.950", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
