It is a composite of a few languages.

Most pidgins do not deal with the complex parts of the languages (rarely masculine, feminine, neuter, simpler conjugation, etc.) and just deal with the rules necessary to make your thoughts understood. Languages that grow from a pidgin will add their own rules or include the rules from the languages they developed from, but for the most part those rules are a lot simpler than the rules from the original languages.</p>\n\n<p>English is a relatively young language and is still growing. It is far past its pidgin roots and has gotten more complex, but has not incorporated as many rules as some of the others.</p>\n", "Id":"2410", "ParentId":"2386", "CreationDate":"2012-08-10T21:43:44.400", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1184", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-10T21:43:44.400", "CommentCount":"2"}
