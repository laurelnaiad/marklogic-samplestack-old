You'll find lots of work being done on the importance of gestural information contributing to meaning. Adam Kendon and David McNeill have both done a lot of work on this. To summarise two of the more interesting pieces of work in relation to your question:</p>\n\n<p>Susan Golden-Meadows found that if the gestures accompanying the description of how to solve a maths puzzle contributed to the explanation of how to solve it then children were more likely to be able to solve to problem (see her 2003 book).</p>\n\n<p>By far my farvourite recent work on this is Jenny Green's 2010 thesis (University of Melbourne) on Arrandic story telling . In Arrandic languages of Australia story telling is always performed with speech, gesture and sand drawing. All three contribute meaning to the story. Although it's only one genre of speech some of this does carry over to general discourse.  </p>\n", "Id":"602", "ParentId":"590", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T23:46:51.320", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"64", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-28T23:46:51.320", "CommentCount":"1"}
