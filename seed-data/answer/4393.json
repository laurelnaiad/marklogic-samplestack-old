{"Body":"<p>I think it depends of concrete language. For example in some languages are words with only consonants.</p>\n\n<p>There is the phrase in (both) Czech an Slovak languages which worth of the article in Wikipedia: <strong>Strč prst skrz krk</strong>  (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str%C4%8D_prst_skrz_krk\" rel=\"nofollow\">translation to English, pronunciation, explanation in Wikipedia</a>).  </p>\n\n<p>For Czechs and Slovaks it is natural phrase.</p>\n\n<p>In Armenian language there are surnames like <strong>Mkrtychan</strong>. There are more people with this surname you can find in Google.</p>\n\n<p>Every language has its own set of rules, and I think that exact answer on your question possible to find in Generative linguistics, not in phonology only. Why phrase <strong>Strč prst skrz krk</strong> is natural for Czech and Slovaks, but very bizarre for another people, for another human beings with similar speech organs?</p>\n\n<p>There exists the Generative grammar of Chomsky, which explains construction of sentences. I think if Generative phonology would really exists like branch of science it can give proper answer to your question. </p>\n", "Id":"4393", "ParentId":"4375", "LastEditorUserId":"2446", "CreationDate":"2013-09-07T17:52:18.097", "OwnerUserId":"2446", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-07T19:39:48.690", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2446", "AccountId":"1952173", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-09-07T17:51:47.877", "DisplayName":"Ziutek Kirelejson", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-05T21:42:39.950", "AboutMe":"<p>English, Polski, Русский -  Lubuntu 13.10</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-07T19:39:48.690", "Score":"-2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2446", "AccountId":"1952173", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-09-07T17:51:47.877", "DisplayName":"Ziutek Kirelejson", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-05T21:42:39.950", "AboutMe":"<p>English, Polski, Русский -  Lubuntu 13.10</p>\n"}}
