{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>If personal anecdotes are ok, and \"thinking in a language\" includes internal conversations like \"what do I want for dinner today\" (introspective people have a never-ending conversation/discussion going in their heads), then I would say I am capable of thinking in both my mother tongue and English, and that I almost manage to think in German when I've been there long enough. What language I think in depends om my surroundings or what I have been reading recently. Since I'm writing this answer in English, I am currently thinking in English. I dream in both my mother tongue and English and sometimes in halting German. I often can't remember the language of some article recently read, I only remember the content.</p>\n\n<p>I would go so far as saying that you aren't really fluent in a language until you can think in it, mentally switch to it completely. If you need to translate in your head you are not fluent. For me, this can make translation quite hard as I know what a word means in one language but lack that word in a different language and so have to resort to circumlocutions and a lot of hemming and hawing and halting explanations :)</p>\n", "Id":"951", "ParentId":"949", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T09:17:18.987", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-04T09:17:18.987", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
