{"Body":"<p>Regarding question 3, most linguists I know would like to see all languages preserved, but also understand that people need to have command of the language of power in order to survive and succeed in wider society. There's no contradiction in this, it just means that people should be supported in being competent in more than one language. When linguists study an endangered language (that is, one where intergenerational transmission has been interrupted) it's held to be an important part of our fieldwork ethic that we should offer the community help in preserving their language, if that's what they want. So yes, where appropriate, they should do something about it.</p>\n", "Id":"647", "ParentId":"573", "LastEditorUserId":"363", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T12:42:11.137", "OwnerUserId":"363", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-03T00:56:52.993", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ümlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-03T00:56:52.993", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ümlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}}
