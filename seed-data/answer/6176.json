{"Body":"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Many Slavic languages don't use diacritic marks. For example, modern Russian and Ukrainian.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I admit I'm expanding your question a bit, but I hope I have good reasons to do so.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, although the marks look suspiciously similar, we should not mix them because they differ by their function:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apostrophe</strong> in English possessive is a punctuation mark. It is not a diacritic mark since it does not affect pronunciation. Instead, it lets the reader not to confuse plural over the possessive;</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diaeresis</a></strong> (Hiatus), often used in Romance languages of Europe, is used to avoid reading two symbols separately, not as a diphthong. One of the most common examples where it could be suitable for English is the word <code>cooperation</code>, where <code>oo</code> can be misread as <code>[u]</code>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Umlauts</a></strong> are yet another class of diacritic marks. Their goal is to modify pronunciation of the vowel or a consonant. These are very language-specific. For instance, in German the umlaut over a vowel would make it centralized and/or lowered;</li>\n<li>English <code>i</code> has a dot over it for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_%28palaeography%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">purely scripting purpose</a>: it was hard to read it from the Gothic script of 14th century;</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stress mark</a></strong> looks like an apostrophe, but used to resolve ambiguity of the stressed syllable in a word;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this context, Russian <code>ё</code> and <code>й</code> do not belong to any of the groups above. They represent independent phonemes, a palatalized <code>[o]</code> (as in English word <code>York</code>) and a palatal consonant <code>[j]</code> (as in English <code>may</code>), correspondingly. Considering above, they can't be considered diacritic marks.</p>\n\n<p>There are also examples in other languages: Spanish <code>ñ</code> is often treated as an individual consonant, not a modified <code>n</code>, and the same applies to Swedish/Norwegian <code>å</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>We also can find that <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/1960/1009\">almost no language is 100% phonemic</a>. In other words, there's no one-to-one correspondence between the phonemes and graphemes.</p>\n\n<p>However, due to historic reasons, <strong>this gap was treated in different manners</strong> for different languages. In English, it lead to huge differences of how the words written and read.</p>\n\n<p>Consider <code>tear</code> <code>[tɪə]</code> (noun as in <code>teardrop</code>) and <code>tear</code> <code>[tɛə]</code> (verb as in <code>to tear off</code>).<br>\n<em>If it happened in another language like French or German, one of these words would most certainly obtain a diacritic mark</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Summarizing</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>English \"suffers\" of the same inconsistency between phonemes and graphemes as other languages do. However, historically, this inconsistency has been rather ignored than resolved grammatically;</li>\n<li>There are languages like Russian that <strong>also</strong> ignore this inconsistency and hence are not using diacritic marks;</li>\n<li>Again, absence of diacritic marks doesn't magically resolve the ambiguities above.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"6176", "ParentId":"6173", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-12-17T11:31:36.500", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-17T11:37:31.497", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-17T11:37:31.497", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
