{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The consensus is that Grimm's law occurs before Verner's law. You will in the field of Indo-European linguistics always find someone who claims the opposite of what the consensus says. So it's important to know what the consensus is.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an argument in favor of the traditional approach:</p>\n\n<p>Verner's law turns voiceless fricatives into voiced fricatives. You can read more about that in my 2011 paper \"The phonetics and phonologization of Verner’s law\". But, Verner's law also targets Proto-Indo-European */k/. How is that possible? Well, Grimm's law turns Proto-Indo-European */k/ into a voiceless fricative */χ/, so if we order Grimm's law before Verner's law, then the outcome follows: */k/ > */χ/ > */ɣ/. You can read more about that in my 2009 paper \"The development of voiced labiovelars in Germanic\".
