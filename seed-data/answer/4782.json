{"Body":"<p>There is no real way to predict the perfect stem or the supine stem (past-participle stem) of a Latin verb; there are only probabilities. One normally learns the past stems of a verb along with its present stem and conjugation group if they are irregular.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The regular suffix to form the <strong>perfect stem</strong> is by adding <em>-v-</em> to the present stem, so after the theme vowel. This is very common, especially for verbs of the <em>-a-</em> conjugation, and also somewhat common for the <em>-i-</em> conjugation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>voca-re → voca-v-i</p>\n  \n  <p>audi-re → audi-v-i</p>\n  \n  <p>quaer-ĕ-re / quaes-ĕ-re → quaes-i-v-i or quaes-i-i  (r changes into s)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another common way of forming the perfect stem is by removing the theme vowel (if present) and adding <em>-u-</em>. This is especially common for verbs of the <em>-ē-</em> conjugation, but by no means limited to it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>terrē-re → terr-u-i</p>\n  \n  <p>evanesc-ĕ-re → evan-u-i (ingressive present suffix <em>-sc-</em> disappears)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Adding /s/ is also quite frequent, especially with consonant stems. The resulting letter may be an x if the present stem ended on <em>-c-</em> or <em>-g-</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>mitt-ĕ-re → mis-i</p>\n  \n  <p>teg-ĕ-re → tex-i</p>\n  \n  <p>torquē-re → torsi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many verbs do not get a suffix at all, especially but not exclusively with consonant stems, but the vowel in the stem will be lengthened compensatorily, and sometimes changed qualitatively:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>vĕni-re → vēn-i</p>\n  \n  <p>vĭdē-re → vīd-i</p>\n  \n  <p>vinc-ĕ-re → vīc-i (nasal present infix disappears)</p>\n  \n  <p>fund-ĕ-re → fūd-i (nasal present infix disappears)</p>\n  \n  <p>ăg-ĕ-re → ēg-i (vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>făc-ĕ-re → fēc-i (vowel changes)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many verbs of the <em>-i-</em> conjugation have both <em>-v-i</em> and <em>-i</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>audi-re → audi-i / audi-v-i (alternative to audi-v-i)</p>\n  \n  <p>i-re → i-i / ī-v-i</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some verbs undergo reduplication, which is an artefact from proto- or pre-Latin, if I remember correctly. This, too, is most common with consonant stems. The vowel will often change in length and quality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>fall-ĕ-re → fe-fell-i (vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>caed-ĕ-re → cĕ-cīd-i (vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>tang-ĕ-re → te-tig-i (nasal infix disappears; vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>făc-ĕ-re → <em>archaic</em> fe-fec-i (vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>păr-ĕ/i-re → pe-pĕr-i (vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>pell-ĕ-re → pĕ-pŭl-i (vowel changes)</p>\n  \n  <p>posc-ĕ-re → po-posc-i (o-reduplication)</p>\n  \n  <p>spondē-re → spo-pond-i (apparently unique, based on Proto-Indo-European perfect)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But none of these rules are remotely strict or consistently applied. And many verbs have several perfect stems that can be used interchangeably.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <strong>supine stem</strong> (past participle) is regularly (but by no means always) formed by adding <em>-t-</em> after the theme vowel, if present, where theme vowel <em>-ē-</em> changes into <em>-i-</em>. This <em>-i-tus</em> sometimes also happens with consonant stems. Supine stems are just as irregular and unpredictable as perfect stems, and many verbs even have two interchangeable supine stems.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>voca-re → voca-t-us</p>\n  \n  <p>audi-re → audi-t-us</p>\n  \n  <p>terrē-re → terr-i-t-us</p>\n  \n  <p>pet-ĕ-re → pet-i-tus</p>\n  \n  <p>cognosc-ĕ-re → cogn-i-t-us (ingressive suffix <em>-sc-</em> disappears)</p>\n  \n  <p>quaer-ĕ-re → quaes-i-tus (r changes into s)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in many cases the suffix <em>-t-</em> has to come immediately after a consonant; in that case, many things can happen. This is perhaps unexpectedly not limited to consonant stems.</p>\n\n<p>After p and c, it can come immediately after:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>cap-ĕ-re → cap-t-us</p>\n  \n  <p>fac-ĕ-re → fac-t-us</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The dental consonant <em>-t-</em> plus <em>-t-</em> often but not always becomes <em>-ss-</em>. This sometimes also happens after <em>-d-</em>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>mitt-ĕ-re → mis-s-us</p>\n  \n  <p>ced-ĕ-re → ces-s-us</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But <em>-d-</em> plus <em>-t-</em> usually becomes <em>-s-</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>fund-ĕ-re → fus-us (nasal present infix disappears)</p>\n  \n  <p>caed-ĕ-re → caes-us</p>\n  \n  <p>accend-ĕ-re → accens-us</p>\n  \n  <p>spondē-re → spons-us</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After <em>-l-</em>, it is turned into <em>-s-</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>fall-ĕ-re → fal-s-us</p>\n  \n  <p>pell-ĕ-re → pul-s-us (vowel changes)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consonant g becomes unvoiced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ag-ĕ-re → ac-t-us</p>\n  \n  <p>frang-ĕ-re → frac-t-us (nasal infix disappears)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consonant b becomes unvoiced and t may or may not turn into s (but verb stems on <em>-b-</em> are rare at any rate):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>lab-i (deponens) → lap-s-us</p>\n  \n  <p>scrib-ĕ-re → scrip-t-us</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"4782", "ParentId":"4776", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-10-24T14:22:36.347", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-27T13:45:39.593", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-27T13:45:39.593", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
