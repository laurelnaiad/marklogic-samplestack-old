{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I don't know of any case of a particular script or orthography influencing grammar but writing in general can have an influence. Written forms of a language are very often their own \"dialect\" or register. Sentences tend to be longer and more grammatically complex. Undoubtedly this feeds back into the spoken language to some degree. But I guess this isn't the kind of answer you are looking for.
