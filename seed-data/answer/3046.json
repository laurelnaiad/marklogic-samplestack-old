{"Body":"<p>As a native speaker, let me try to describe it. To be most specific, I will refer Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<p>Short rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Keyword: \"a <strong>city</strong> of New York\"; <code>city</code> is masculine, hence most often, city names are masculine as well;</li>\n<li>Pronunciation: words ending with consonant - masculine; ending with <code>-e</code>, <code>-o</code> - usually neutral; <code>-a</code> - feminine;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>TL;DR, just if you are curious to details</p>\n\n<p>First, let me remind that grammatical gender (GG) has no relation to lexical meaning of the word; you have just to remember GG of each noun.</p>\n\n<p>Also, although there are three formal GG, there are nouns that are always singular, plural or dual.</p>\n\n<p>Most loanwords belong to the following groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No declension: coffee, cocoa, Bourdeau (wine), Euro (currency), etc;</li>\n<li>Toponyms: America, Tokyo, Mississippi, Himalaya;</li>\n<li>Abbreviations (OUN, USA);</li>\n<li>Noun groups</li>\n<li>Naturally plural or paired items (types of shoes);</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>General rule</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Those ending on <code>-o</code>, <code>-e</code> (many French and Italian words) usually become <strong>neutral</strong>;</li>\n<li>Ending with <code>-a</code> become <strong>feminine</strong>;  </li>\n<li>Ending with a plosive consonant become <strong>masculine</strong>;  </li>\n<li>Ending with soft sign (pronounced with soft final consonant) so <strong>fem</strong>;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Nouns that do not decline</strong></p>\n\n<p>They usually used to be proper nouns that later started to mean common terms (whisky, Champagne, Bourdeau, brandy, Euro). <em>Note they have retained capitalization in English, but in Slavic languages they are regular words, unlike toponyms.</em><br>\nThere's no certain rule, and GG is assigned according to similar existing loanword nouns. For instance, most <em>non-declining</em> words borrowed from Romance languages are <strong>neuter</strong> due to their pronunciation (ending with <code>-e</code> or <code>-o</code>).</p>\n\n<p>There are many exceptions, however:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RU, UA: <code>whisky</code> can be either <strong>masc</strong> or <strong>neutr</strong>;</li>\n<li>RU: <code>кофе</code> (coffee) is masculine due to historical reasons: there was an older version <code>кофий</code>, ending with a consonant;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Naturally plural or paired items</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously, they are plural (grammatically, plural and dual are the same). Note that in most declensions, there is no difference between masculine+plural, feminine+plural, and neutral+plural.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Moccasin - shoes, naturally paired;</li>\n<li>Jeans - naturally plural;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Noun groups</strong></p>\n\n<p>If one word has no declension while the other has, the GG of the whole group is given by the word that has declension.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Web-page</code>, where <code>Web</code> has no declension while <code>page</code> is a common word (<strong>fem</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Toponyms</strong></p>\n\n<p>GG is given according to what category the noun belongs to. Look again at the rule above and think of \"the <strong>city</strong> of New York\".</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Mississippi</code> is a river; river is <strong>fem</strong>, hence, <code>Mississippi</code> is as well;</li>\n<li><code>Ontario</code> is a lake; <code>lake</code> is <strong>neutral</strong>;</li>\n<li><code>San-Francisco</code> is a city; <code>city</code> is <strong>masc</strong>;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are lots of exceptions here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Hudson</code>, <code>Rhein</code>, although <code>river</code>s (fem), are <strong>masc</strong> - probably, due to ending with plosive consonant;</li>\n<li><code>Philadelphia</code>, <code>Nevada</code>, are states (<code>state</code> is <strong>masc</strong>), is <strong>fem</strong>, again, probably, due to it ends with <code>-a</code>;</li>\n<li>RU: <code>Vienna</code> is a city (must be masc), but is <strong>fem</strong>;</li>\n<li>UA: <code>city</code> is <strong>neutral</strong>, but it does not apply on most city names; For example, <code>Vienna</code> is written <code>Відень</code> ['videnʲ], and it is <strong>masc</strong>;</li>\n<li><code>Apache</code> is tribe (must be neutral), but is <strong>plural</strong>;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Abbreviations</strong></p>\n\n<p>GG is given by the keyword:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>OUN stands for \"<strong>Organization</strong> of United Nations\", the highlighted keyword is <strong>fem</strong> (all words ending with <code>-ion</code> are <strong>fem</strong>)</li>\n<li>USA stands for \"United <strong>States</strong> of America\", and it is <strong>plural</strong>;</li>\n<li>TCP/IP is an \"Internet <strong>protocol</strong>\", <strong>masc</strong>;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>And yes, if the loanword does not apparently belong to any of the groups above, it is often considered by its category or keyword.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if that was too boring, I have good news: there are lots of exceptions. :)</p>\n", "Id":"3046", "ParentId":"3044", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-01-08T04:58:04.857", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-09T02:49:39.003", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-09T02:49:39.003", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"17", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
