{"Body":"<p>For many languages it is claimed that they lack adjectives (for instance Thai), and that either nouns or verbs are used instead. Others claim that all languages have adjectives, if you look closely enough. Japanese has two types of adjectives: noun-like and verb-like. However it can also be analysed as having no adjectives, if the verb-like adjectives were considered just to be odd verbs and the noun-like adjectives were considered just to be odd nouns. In some languages adjectives are a closed class of words - are they still then adjectives? Not if being an open class is part of the definition of adjective :) (An <em>open class</em> may gain and lose words while a <em>closed class</em> is of a much more stable size.)</p>\n\n<p>Ditto for languages that are claimed to lack nouns or verbs, it's a matter of how \"noun\" and \"verb\" is defined. AFAIK there is not yet consensus on any language lacking nouns or verbs. </p>\n\n<p>Lacking articles (the, a) is not so uncommon, but I don't think there are languages that lack determiners as a whole (articles are a subset of determiners).</p>\n", "Id":"284", "ParentId":"280", "LastEditorUserId":"119", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T09:41:51.803", "OwnerUserId":"119", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-20T20:55:57.747", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-20T20:55:57.747", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
