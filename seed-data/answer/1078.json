{"Body":"<p>I would like to add a very important reminder here. I don't think it's a good idea to say that some languages are agglutinative and others are not (isolating, inflectional etc.). This Humdoldtian-Schleicherian (individualizing) approach is flawed because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It recognizes one typological parameter, the morphological structure of words.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is based on an assumption that a language as a whole has a unique character (Croft 2003, p. 46), also see part 13.1 \"Morphological typology\" in Laurie Bauer's 2003 <a href=\"http://www.press.georgetown.edu/book/languages/introducing-linguistic-morphology\">textbook</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In fact, even Sapir (in the 1920's!) criticized that approach. All intro textbooks still use those terms but <strong>in modern linguistic typological research</strong>, terms like \"agglutinative/isolating languages\" <strong>are no longer used/avoided</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As for wordhood tests, you should read Martin Haspelmath's <a href=\"http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/staff/haspelmath/pdf/WordSegmentation.pdf\">2011</a> paper in <a href=\"http://www.reference-global.com/loi/flin\">Folia Linguistica 45(1)</a>. He addresses all of your questions, and it is a very good review article.</p>\n", "Id":"1078", "ParentId":"1069", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T17:04:09.890", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-27T17:10:20.580", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-27T17:10:20.580", "Score":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
