{"Body":"<p>Persian had used to use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahlavi_scripts\" rel=\"nofollow\">a variety</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow\">alphabets</a> throughout the time, so I think it would not make any particular difficulty to read in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Persian Arabic</a> alphabet as well. The main difficulties are</p>\n\n<p>a) sounds not present in Arabic, yet noticeable in Persian (or other languages using the script), and</p>\n\n<p>b) a richer stock of vowels. These two factors elicit in Persian Arabic script, respectfully,</p>\n\n<p>a) four new letters with some more dots to distinguish phonemes [p]پ, [t͡ʃ] (ch)چ, [ʒ]ژ zhe and [ɡ]گ, and</p>\n\n<p>b) using 'Alef for [ɒ], Vav for [v] / [uː] / [o] / [ow] / [oː] (in Dari), Yi for [ɒː] / [eː] (in Dari) and not distinguishing short vowels.</p>\n\n<p>The key principle might be similar to that of using Arabic script for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aljamiado\" rel=\"nofollow\">aljamiado</a> texts in Medieval Spain, or to write (Turkic) Tatar language in Belorussia with the Arabic script.</p>\n\n<p>The Abjad is still vastly used for most of non-Semitic languages spoken throughout former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocharians\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tocharian</a> areas and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogdia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sogdia</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>What is truly interesing, from my point of view, is how the Arabic script was used by Chinese muslims (A.K.A. Huizu) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoerjin\" rel=\"nofollow\">to write Chinese</a> words, and there are still examples of reversed order of two-syllable (that is, two-character) words among some of Chinese Hui people.</p>\n", "Id":"4370", "ParentId":"4365", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2013-09-01T06:41:36.443", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-05T08:05:17.977", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-05T08:05:17.977", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
