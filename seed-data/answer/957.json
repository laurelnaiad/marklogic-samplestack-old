{"Body":"<p>As I suspected, this is indeed a case of <strong>suppletion</strong>, a term defined by <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0874808936\">A Glossary of Historical Linguistics</a> as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The use of two or more originally unconnected\n  forms (roots, stems) in the inflection of a single lexical\n  item, for example, <em>go</em>&#47;<em>went</em>, where originally <em>went</em> was\n  not part of the tenses of ‘to go’ but rather was the past\n  tense of <em>wend</em>, which was taken over as the past of ‘to\n  go’ and incorporated into its inflectional paradigm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Examining your examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Portuguese <em>metade</em> is cognate to <em>meio</em>, from Latin <em>medius</em>, ultimately from PIE *<em>medʰyo-</em> (‘between’). Analogously for other Romance languages.</p></li>\n<li><p>German <em>Hälfte</em> comes from Proto-Germanic *<em>halbaz</em>, which is connected with the Indo-European root *<em>(s)kel-</em> ('to split'). Analogously for other Germanic languages.</p></li>\n<li><p>Scottish <em>leth</em> comes from Old Irish <em>leth</em>, (‘side’). Analogously for other Goidelic languages.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hebrew <em>חצי</em> is derived from the root <em>חצה</em> ('to divide').</p></li>\n<li><p>Hungarian <em>fél</em> comes from Proto-Uralic <em>pälä</em> ('side'). Analogously for other Uralic languages.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Accorging to <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=76UUIcCqMYkC\">Fisiak</a>, this is the same process that caused the irregularity <em>one</em> &rarr; <em>first</em>, <em>two</em> &rarr; <em>second</em> in several languages. Since the word for <em>half</em> (as the words for <em>first</em>, <em>second</em> and <em>third</em>) is much more frequently used than the words for other fractions, it tends to maintain its irregularity over time. Another source of this irregularity is that children do not learn to count as <em>one</em> &rarr; <em>first</em>, <em>two</em> &rarr; <em>second</em>, etc. Instead, they learn the ordinal and cardinal sequences separately. This is probably what happens to the fraction numbers as well, which constitutes another barrier to regularization.</p>\n", "Id":"957", "ParentId":"918", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T00:48:05.027", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-05T09:09:57.013", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
