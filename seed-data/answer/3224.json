Every language has something called phonotactics, which are language specific rules for what sounds can occur, where they can occur and in what combinations they can occur.  For example, English phonotactics prevent the consonant cluster [pf], whereas in German [pf] is acceptable as in the word <em>Pferd</em> 'horse'. Also in English we pronounce the word gnome [nom] instead of [gnom], because English phonotactics prevents the cluster [gn].  It is a result of these rules that some languages can have certain sounds and combinations of sounds that other languages can't have.  </p>\n", "Id":"3224", "ParentId":"3211", "CreationDate":"2013-02-18T11:22:48.680", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1776", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-18T11:22:48.680", "CommentCount":"2"}
