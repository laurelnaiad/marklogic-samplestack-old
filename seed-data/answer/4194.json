A diphthong is a sequence comprising a vowel and a glide, at least, according to the Summer Institute of Linguistics:   <a href=\"http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsADiphthong.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsADiphthong.htm</a>   </p>\n\n<p>A glide, or semivowel, is defined at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glide_%28linguistics%29</a> as “a sound, such as English /w/ or /j/, that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary rather than as the nucleus of a syllable.”   In other words, a sound that is like a vowel, but non-syllabic.   </p>\n\n<p>When the glide comes first in the diphthong, we have words such as British “new” [nju], in which [j] as in \"yes\" [jɛs] is the glide.    </p>\n\n<p>When the glide comes last in the diphthong, we have words like English “aisle” [aɪ̯l], in which [ɪ̯] is the glide.   </p>\n\n<p>Note the little curve symbol under the &lt;ɪ>, yielding &lt;ɪ̯>.    That little curve, called an <em>inverted breve</em>, means that the vowel sound is non-syllabic, i.e. that it’s a glide.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, vowels aren’t the only sounds that can be syllable nuclei.   Consider syllabic consonants, such as the [̯̯̯̯l̩] in “bottle” [bɑdl̩].
