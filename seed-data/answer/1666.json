{"Body":"<p>Here's how I would analyse your sentences.</p>\n\n<p>In all of your examples the constituent [doing my homework], a non-finite clause, has the same function, that of an adjunct (Huddleston and Pullum 2002). It modifies the matrix clause but not the subject in the matrix clause because adjuncts usually modify either a verbal phrase or another clause or the whole sentence. The connection between the clauses in your examples is not \"what kind of I\" or \"what kind of good/trouble\", so it can't be a noun-adjective postmodifier. The connection between the clauses is temporal.</p>\n\n<p>Quirk et al. 1985: an adverbial clause of time, reason etc.</p>\n\n<p>\"Doing\" in your examples is what Huddleston and Pullum 2002 call an \"gerund-participle\" since they decide not to distinguish between participle I and a gerund.</p>\n", "Id":"1666", "ParentId":"1648", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2012-03-19T23:33:49.803", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-20T19:10:40.403", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-20T19:10:40.403", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
