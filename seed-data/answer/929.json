I figure if all goes well, I'll be teaching Intro to Linguistics once a year for the rest of my life, and I may as well get good at it.</p>\n", "Age":"33", "Location":"Austin, TX", "DownVotes":"7", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"2968", "DisplayName":"Dan Velleman", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-24T15:27:53.380"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>In creole studies, you'll hear languages like this described as <em>lexifiers.</em>  So for instance, with Haitian Creole &mdash; which takes a lot of grammatical features from West African languages, but has a mostly French vocabulary &mdash; you can say that French was the the lexifier.
