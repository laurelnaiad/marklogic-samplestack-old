The process could be sped up by the simplicity of learning the language, yet people will learn any language that they NEED to learn. This is more a political issue than linguistic, at least in my opinion.</p>\n", "Id":"3870", "ParentId":"2377", "CreationDate":"2013-06-16T23:40:18.413", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2163", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-16T23:40:18.413", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"2163", "AccountId":"2906359", "CreationDate":"2013-06-16T22:33:01.730", "AboutMe":"<p>I enjoy dabbling in languages. I almost know one language, that's English, my mother tongue. I have a constructed language I've been working on with friends for a couple years now, we have it going pretty well. I was homeschooled, that's how I've had time to construct a language. I'm an amateur to linguistics though.</p>\n", "Age":"19", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"22", "DisplayName":"Kotoka", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-17T01:47:20.843"}}
