{"Body":"<p>Linguistics is, or should be, a science. Science doesn't tell you how you should value things; personal opinions and value judgments are simply irrelevant. Physicists can tell you how to make a nuclear bomb, but the science of nuclear fission, etc., does not tell you whether you ought to make a bomb.</p>\n\n<p>The reason linguistics books aren't written in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English\">African American Vernacular English</a> is because it is not a standard dialect. The reason it is not a standard dialect is primarily because educated, wealthy and powerful people don't normally use it. And that is more-or-less a historical accident.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the above, I think many rightly criticize prescriptivism because it is one of the last socially acceptable ways to discriminate against people, sometimes standing in for simple racism, other times motivated by a dislike of people with little education, etc.</p>\n", "Id":"156", "ParentId":"155", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T01:31:13.210", "OwnerUserId":"71", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-15T17:59:55.510", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-15T17:59:55.510", "Score":"23", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"21", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Tucson, AZ", "Id":"71", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"158152", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"554", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T22:53:16.427", "DisplayName":"Alan H.", "LastAccessDate":"2011-10-08T15:51:29.733", "AboutMe":""}}
