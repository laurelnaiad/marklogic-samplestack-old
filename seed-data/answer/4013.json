It depends somewhat on the inclination of the analyst, but for many linguists the presence of the suffix <em>-ist</em> in <em>linguist</em>, where <em>-ist</em> is clearly carrying out its usual function of indicating a person specializing in some field of expertise, is more than enough evidence to show that the word <em>linguist</em> is morphologically complex.</p>\n\n<p>More controversially, the presence of the <em>lingu-</em> morpheme without <em>-ist</em> in words like <em>lingual</em> and <em>sublingual</em> may be further evidence, though there the meaning 'tongue' is far more common than the meaning 'language', so that may be a different morpheme.</p>\n\n<p>I see little evidence to suggest that the root in question is <em>lingua-</em>, since I don't know of any English words where the [a] shows up clearly. (The [a] in <em>lingual</em> comes from the suffix <em>-al</em>.) So I'd argue that the morpheme is just <em>lingu-</em>, and it's a bound root roughly meaning 'language', although as with many bound morphemes, it may enter into complex words whose meanings can't be composed purely from their parts (i.e. morphological idioms).</p>\n", "Id":"4013", "ParentId":"3990", "CreationDate":"2013-07-15T23:20:25.087", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2250", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-15T23:20:25.087", "CommentCount":"1"}
