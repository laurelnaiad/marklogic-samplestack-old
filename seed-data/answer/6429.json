{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I've gotten around the problem of inventing a new term (and kind of word) as follows. </p>\n\n<p>The issue of adjectives (or articles, for that matter) functioning alone as complete noun phrases came up in the context of a computational dependency grammar for German. Canonical dependency grammar takes the noun to be the <code>governor</code> of the noun phrase, and the adjective to depend on it: </p>\n\n<pre><code>[\"don't give up\" [\"youth\" [\"the\"] [\"headstrong\"]] [\"easily\"]] \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>if you will. </p>\n\n<p>In German, much inflection is carried by the adjective, even more when it comes alone (\"strong\" inflectional paradigm as opposed to \"weak\" paradigm when an article is present). This, in connection with the fact that adjectives precede nouns in German, lead me to the idea that the adjective (and the article) \"project\" a noun to follow. If the noun does not show up, an empty \"shell\" (lexically empty noun) is left in the syntax tree. </p>\n\n<p>If this analysis can be applied to English as well, you don't need a special Adj/N class, since (a subclass of) adjectives just simply do project nouns. Well, maybe you need a name for this subclass of adjectives which do that. German adjectives do that across the board.</p>\n", "Id":"6429", "ParentId":"6058", "CreationDate":"2014-01-16T16:27:12.647", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"3005", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-16T16:27:12.647", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e605fb13af829efa6c77e227bd4ef2da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"3005", "AccountId":"1400191", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"115", "CreationDate":"2014-01-09T12:05:05.263", "DisplayName":"virtualnobi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T11:58:24.770"}}
