{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>In Heine and Kuteva's (2002) <em>World Lexicon of Grammaticalization</em> you'll find examples of words with lexical meanings \"give, leave, arrive\" having grammaticalized into morphemes expressing dative, ablative, and allative meanings, respectively. However, what is documented are cases of words with lexical meanings gradually changing into words which are best treated as adpositions. When you are thinking of case systems, you are probably interested in cases where a language gains a nominal affix used to express a case relation. Here, the most likely historical change is where a word which already has case-like meaning (viz. an adposition) fuses to the noun.
