We'll follow the convention of putting spellings between |vertical pipes| and putting pronunciations between /slashes/.</p>\n\n<h2>|x| might as well be |ks|</h2>\n\n<p>Why do we have |x| at all?  Historical accident -- the letter |x| was used to spell /ks/ in Western Greek, then was borrowed by the Etruscans, then by the Romans, then by the Saxons.  Usually when people borrow a writing system, they borrow the whole thing, even if it's not a perfect fit for their own language.</p>\n\n<h2>|c| says either /k/ or /s/</h2>\n\n<p>Two questions come up here: Why does |c| have two sounds?  Why do we have |c| in the first place?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Greek had a letter |Γ| for /g/ and a letter |Κ| for /k/.  The Etruscans didn't distinguish these sounds in their language, so they only needed one of the two.  They kept |Γ| and gradually dropped |Κ|.  The Romans borrowed the Etruscan alphabet, but their language <em>did</em> distinguish /g/ and /k/, so they made a variant form of |Γ| by adding a little tail to it, thus distinguishing |C| from |G|.</p></li>\n<li><p>A sound change occurred in some parts of the Latin-speaking world where /k/ changed to /s/ in certain environments.  The sounds changed, but the spelling didn't.  So where |cena| used to be pronounced /kena/, it ended up being pronounced /sena/.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>silent |k|</h1>\n\n<p>This one doesn't come from Latin at all.  In Old English, the word \"knight\" was pronounced /kniht/ -- both the |k| and the |gh| were pronounced.  Over the centuries, spoken English changed so that now |knight| is pronounced /nʌjt/.  The /k/ disappeared, but the |k| didn't, so now there's a mismatch between the spoken and written forms.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Sometimes the written and spoken forms of a language evolve separately.  A change in written English might not affect the way words sound, and a change in spoken English might not affect the way words are spelled.  Language always changes over time, whether spoken or written.</p>\n\n<p>I'm glossing over some details in the examples above, but I hope you get the gist of it.</p>\n", "Id":"1809", "ParentId":"1808", "CreationDate":"2012-04-17T16:37:07.117", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"314", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-17T16:37:07.117", "CommentCount":"10"}
