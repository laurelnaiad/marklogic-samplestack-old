This is probably most true of departments which have a focus on descriptive/documentary linguistics. I am aware of one person who is doing a doctorate on a constructed language that is used for religious purposes by a group in an Asian country. Being a constructed language (and not anyone's first language) it is not complete, in the sense that there are numerous gaps in what can be expressed (ie things that all natural languages can express). For this reason a lot of the analysis is on the sociolinguistics of the situation that led to the construction of the language and which continues to support its continued usage.</p>\n\n<p>It has been suggested that Classical Sanskrit can be considered a constructed language. Classical Sanskrit may be studied at many universities and it is quite possible to do higher degree research on it.</p>\n", "Id":"2047", "ParentId":"2045", "CreationDate":"2012-06-05T09:57:34.100", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-05T09:57:34.100", "CommentCount":"1"}
