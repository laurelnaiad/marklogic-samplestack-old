{"Body":"<p>Edward Sapir's classic paper <a href=\"http://www.ucalgary.ca/dflynn/files/dflynn/Sapir33.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Psychological Reality of Phonemes</em></a> argues that the phoneme (as opposed to the phone, an object properly in the domain of phonetics) is necessary to understand phonological systems. More recently, probably beginning with Chomsky &amp; Halle's <em>The Sound Pattern of English</em>, phonemes were `decomposed' into bundles of features that can be the target of phonological rules. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_Pattern_of_English\" rel=\"nofollow\">the wiki page</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chomsky and Halle represent speech sounds as bundles of plus-or-minus \n  valued features (e.g. vocalic, high, back, anterior, nasal, etc..) The \n  phonological component of each lexical entry is considered to be a \n  linear sequence of these feature bundles. A number of context-sensitive\n  rules transform the underlying form of a sequence of words into the \n  final phonetic form that is uttered by the speaker. These rules are \n  allowed access to the tree structure that the syntax is said to output. \n  This access allows rules that apply, for example, only at the end of a \n  word, or only at the end of a noun phrase.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as I'm aware (though I am no phonologist), there is not much of a debate within rule-based phonology about the status of the phoneme (or, the feature bundle it `names') as a theoretical necessity. Outside of rule-based phonology, I'm not sure the issue is treated. </p>\n", "Id":"420", "ParentId":"212", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T15:10:45.183", "OwnerUserId":"178", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-09T09:39:05.780", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-09T09:39:05.780", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}}
