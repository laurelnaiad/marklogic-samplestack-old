{"OwnerDisplayName":"Daniel Harbour", "Body":"<p>Just a brief comment on the more Englishy aspect of the question.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between Spanish and English in this regard is not connected to Arabic.  Rather it’s a <strong>Germanic versus Romance</strong> feature: Germanic languages as a whole have phrasal verbs (in which a particle, frequently homophonous with a preposition, is syntactically separable from the verb, as in <em>look it up</em>), Romance languages do not (such “preposition”+verb combinations as they have are not syntactically separable; this inseparability survives in Germanic borrowings, like <em>commit</em>, <em>remit</em>, <em>admit</em>, <em>permit</em>, resulting in roots, such as <em>mit</em> do not occur without a prefix).</p>\n\n<p>Within English, you need to distinguish between <em>look for</em> and <em>look up</em> type verbs.  In the former case, <em>for</em> is the preposition used if there is an object; in the latter, <em>up</em> is always present, as a necessary part of the meaning.  Hence, the following is possible (no object, no <em>for</em>): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A: Did you look for them?</p>\n  \n  <p>B: Yes, I looked all morning / Yes, I spent the whole morning looking</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In contrast to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A: Did you look them up?</p>\n  \n  <p>B: ??Yes, I looked all morning / ??Yes, I spent the whole morning looking</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are also syntactic differences.  A object can intervene between verb and particle, or it can follow the particle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I looked them up</p>\n  \n  <p>I looked up the answers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This variation is unavailable for verbs that select a prepositional, rather than a nominal, complement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I looked for the answers</p>\n  \n  <p><em>*</em> I looked them for</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2350", "ParentId":"2349", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2012-08-04T18:24:58.980", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-05T11:03:28.190", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
