Still, it is true that standard Dutch has a 'past tense imperative' (or whatever grammarians really call it). These are formed in a somewhat different manner: \"Had liever wat minder gegeten\", literally \"had rather eaten a bit less\", meaning \"you had better eaten less\". This is a common construction, the most frequent specimen probably being \"Had dat meteen gezegd!\" (\"If only you had said that right away!\"). </p>\n", "Id":"3040", "ParentId":"3036", "CreationDate":"2013-01-06T14:00:52.107", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1649", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-06T14:00:52.107", "CommentCount":"2"}
