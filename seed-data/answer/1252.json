{"Body":"<p>Free software, <a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Audacity'</a>, can apply and preserve, as well as infinitely undo, many useful transformations in any selections of the audio. See its menu, 'Effects'. 'Change Tempo' will change the speed without changing the pitch. For the reverse, 'Change Pitch' will change the pitch without changing the speed. You may also find that adjusting the pitch will be useful in bringing out some barely-audible speech sounds, for easier listening or just giving your ears variety.</p>\n\n<p>Though it lacks the streamlined user interface you requested, with its nice, graphical interface you can visually, easily find different people's speech in a long recording, IMO.</p>\n\n<p>It is downloadable for many OS's, including Mac, and I can confirm it works well on Windows. It handles huge (multi-gigabyte) files and can save in many formats, including MP3.</p>\n", "Id":"1252", "ParentId":"1247", "LastEditorUserId":"660", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T14:01:50.737", "OwnerUserId":"660", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-10T16:45:47.687", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://markdblackwell.blogspot.com", "Location":"Baltimore, MD", "Id":"660", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1155275", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"131", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T14:01:10.000", "DisplayName":"MarkDBlackwell", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-06T16:14:19.943", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MarkDBlackwell\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/MarkDBlackwell</a> http://markdblackwell.blogspot.com/ available:Ruby on Rails,Ruby,CSS,HTML,JavaScript,Java,C++,LilyPond</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-10T16:45:47.687", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://markdblackwell.blogspot.com", "Location":"Baltimore, MD", "Id":"660", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1155275", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"131", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T14:01:10.000", "DisplayName":"MarkDBlackwell", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-06T16:14:19.943", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MarkDBlackwell\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/MarkDBlackwell</a> http://markdblackwell.blogspot.com/ available:Ruby on Rails,Ruby,CSS,HTML,JavaScript,Java,C++,LilyPond</p>\n"}}
