{"Body":"<p>Tlingit phonemically distinguishes <code>/x/</code>, <code>/xʷ/</code>, <code>/xʼ/</code>, <code>/xʼʷ/</code>, <code>/χ/</code>, <code>/χʷ/</code>, <code>/χʼ/</code>, and <code>/χʼʷ/</code> (whew!). It is the only language documented to have the ejective versions of these fricatives. No palatal fricatives though – Tlingit only has a palatal <code>/j/</code> and nothing else. The <code>/x/</code> and <code>/xʼ/</code> can be phonetically palatal when in the environment of a high front vowel, as one would expect. But this is strictly phonetic variation, and it is not obligatory so that <code>/xi/</code> can be either <code>[xi]</code> or <code>[çi]</code> freely, and some speakers never seem to palatalize much at all.</p>\n", "Id":"1465", "ParentId":"1449", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2012-02-18T23:12:06.297", "OwnerUserId":"511", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-19T11:00:01.147", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-19T11:00:01.147", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"30", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.drangle.com/~james", "Id":"511", "AccountId":"513739", "CreationDate":"2011-11-16T02:03:12.387", "AboutMe":"<p>I’m a PhD student in linguistics at the University of British Columbia. I work on Tlingit, a critically endangered language of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and southeast Alaska.

I use Xe(La)TeX, fontspec, memoir, and BibLaTeX extensively, and I am working on a BibLaTeX style for linguistics publications. Other packages I use frequently include pst-jtree, expex, and booktabs. I’m learning PGF/TikZ and considering developing a library to produce autosegmental representation diagrams. I do my writing in TeXShop, and my TeX programming in MacVim, having abandoned FSF Emacs and XEmacs due to their perpetually disappointing Unicode rendering.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"5", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"866", "DisplayName":"James C.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-03T19:13:48.097"}}
