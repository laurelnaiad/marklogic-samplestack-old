{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Although it is a strong tendency it is still only a tendency. The prevalence of these two sounds in the names of parents is not surprising, given that they're two of the easiest sounds to make regardless of the sound system of your language. Think about English - we have 'mother' and 'father' but we'll accept 'mama' or 'dada' as a first word, because they're easy to make - open CV structure and basic stop sounds.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, across the world caregivers have an incentive to hear what they want to hear - and they want to hear their children say their names. Given that cross-linguistically mothers are generally caregivers, the easiest sound 'ma' usually is used first and the harder sound 'pa' or 'da' somewhere around second. Children are already very aware of who their caregivers are before they can articulate that, so as soon as they can articulate something, even something as simple as 'ma' this gets attributed as a name.</p>\n\n<p>So it's less that these words are a strong cross-linguistic tendency and more that parents are anxious to hear meaning in a child's early babbling-like word production!</p>\n", "Id":"867", "ParentId":"865", "CreationDate":"2011-10-21T22:33:57.090", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"64", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-21T22:33:57.090", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"126", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.superlinguo.com", "Id":"64", "AccountId":"900445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:45:12.903", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a PhD in linguistics.
