{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Since  (inter)dental fricatives are indeed not that easy to pronounce for those speakers whose native languages do not have these phonemes (or even those of them whose local pronunciational norm differs), there is a big statistical data of which mistakes and replacements are more common. Some of such \"mispronunciations\" are so common that there exists specials term for them. Here they are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-alveolarization\" rel=\"nofollow\">th-alverorization</a></strong> - ([θ], [ð]) → ([s], [z]). Typical for some English dialects as well. </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-fronting\" rel=\"nofollow\">th-fronting</a></strong> - ([θ], [ð]) → ([f], [v]). There's an excellent quote in wikipedia on this issue: </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Th-fronting occurs (in many cases historically independently) in\n  Cockney, Estuary English, West Country dialects, Yorkshire dialect,\n  Glaswegian, Newfoundland English, African American Vernacular English,\n  and Liberian English, as well as in many foreign accents (though the\n  details differ among those accents).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-stopping\" rel=\"nofollow\">th-stopping</a></strong> - realization of the dental fricatives [θ, ð] as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_consonant\" rel=\"nofollow\">stops</a>. This is also typical for dialect as well as for some accents.</p>\n\n<p>So, to conclude, there's nothing untypical (from the statistical point of view) in how Brazilians pronounce this phonemes, whether they are countrymen or not ;)\nSee, they could have been English monolingual speakers and still follow the same patterns. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dis is da life ))) </p>\n", "Id":"3733", "ParentId":"3728", "CreationDate":"2013-05-17T22:30:27.793", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"533", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-17T22:30:27.793", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"533", "AccountId":"148782", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"206", "CreationDate":"2011-11-24T22:17:33.783", "DisplayName":"shabunc", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-19T19:48:06.507", "Age":"31"}}
