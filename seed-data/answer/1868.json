There are always lots of them; if you have a choice, pick one that marks long vowels with a mācron, since that turns out to be important. (There are online resources, too, but this is simpler, unless you're doing statistics. ) </p>\n\n<p>Open your Latin dictionary to any page. Glance down the wordlist. When you recognize a connection between some Latin word and its meaning <strong>because</strong> you know an English word with <em>sort of</em> that form and <em>sort of</em> that meaning, then <strong><em>Bingo</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>If you get in the habit of looking up English words in Latin dictionaries, you'll see a lot of regular extensions of the words with prefixes and suffixes that you recognize, too. Generally if one Latin root is borrowed, there are several more that came from the same place, and are recognizable. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, on the page in my Latin dictionary with <em>significant</em> on it (as <em>signi-ficō</em> 'to make a sign', <em>significanter</em> 'plainly, clearly', and <em>significātionis</em> 'pointing out, showing, indicating'), one finds also the noun <em>signum</em> 'a sign' and the verb <em>signō</em> 'to mark, to sign', which shows where they all come from. Also on this page is the noun <em>silentium</em> 'silence' and the verb <em>sileō</em> 'to be silent'. And that's just one page.</p>\n\n<p>This should work for about half of the words in English (though at first you might not recognize the Latin words in English that passed repeatedly through the gullets of French speakers for centuries before English got hold of them). The other half of the words in English come from Germanic sources and have passed through <a href=\"http://kmcgowan.rice.edu/wow/grimm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grimm's Law</a>, so their relations with Latin cognates are complex. But this is an easy way to start.</p>\n", "Id":"1868", "ParentId":"1866", "CreationDate":"2012-05-02T17:57:34.510", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-02T17:57:34.510", "CommentCount":"6"}
