{"Body":"<p>Going through the derivation might help. Since your question is framed in terms of the generative framework, i'll give my answer also from a generative PoV - specifically, from the PoV of the Minimalist Program, where movement is feature-driven. I presuppose i certain amount of familiarity with minimalism in my answer, so apologies in advance.</p>\n\n<p>We start with the following 'Numeration'/'Lexical Array'. I've only included featural specifications (which are given in square brackets) where they will be relevant to the derivation. Note that i'm also going to ignore subject-auxiliary inversion in the derivation. I also use bare phrase structure labelling, so no distinction between maximal projections and intermediate levels.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>{Whom[wh], will, you, invite, <em>C</em>[*u*Wh]}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First we merge 'whom' and 'invite', so that 'invite' satisfies its internal theta-role, and 'whom' is assigned accusative case. Note that 'whom' possesses an interpretable Wh feature.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1) [<em>V</em> invite whom[wh] ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next we merge the subject, 'you', which satisfies the external theta-role of 'invite':</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(2) [<em>V</em> you [<em>V</em> invite whom[wh] ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next we merge 'will':</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(3) [<em>I</em> will [<em>V</em> you [<em>V</em> invite whom[wh]]]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Movement of the subject 'you' to SpecIP is triggered (by, e.g. an EPP feature on I):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(4) [<em>I</em> you [<em>I</em> will [<em>V</em> you [<em>V</em> invite whom[wh]]]]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interrogative C is merged:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(5) [<em>C</em> C[*u*Wh] [<em>I</em> you [<em>I</em> will [<em>V</em> you [<em>V</em> invite whom[wh]]]]]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now we've reached the crucial part of the derivation. Interogative C possesses an <em>uninterpretable</em> wh-feature, which must be deleted before spell-out, or the derivation will crash. The [*u*Wh] feature 'probes' downwards for a matching 'goal' - since 'whom' posseses an interpretable [wh] it counts as a matching goal. Once the goal is found, movement of 'whom' to SpecCP is triggered, and [uWh] is deleted in a spec-head configuration under AGREE with 'whom'.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(6) [<em>C</em> {whom[wh]} [<em>C</em> C [<em>I</em> you [<em>I</em> will [<em>V</em> you [<em>V</em> invite {whom[wh]}]]]]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is that 'you' doesn't count as an intervener, since it doesn't possess a [wh] feature. Interrogative <em>C</em> probes specifically for [wh] - anything not possessing [wh] isn't visible to the probing operation. <strong>Intervention is relativised - only elements of the relevant sort count as interveners.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We can see that other wh-words <em>do</em> count as interveners by considering the well known superiority effects:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(a) Who <em>t</em> bought what?<br>\n  (b) What did who buy <em>t</em>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the subject is closer to interrogative <em>C</em> than the object, it counts as an intervener to wh-movement of the object, as attested by the ungrammaticality of (b).</p>\n", "Id":"4835", "ParentId":"4828", "LastEditorUserId":"2328", "CreationDate":"2013-11-02T17:19:11.047", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-02T17:26:42.360", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
