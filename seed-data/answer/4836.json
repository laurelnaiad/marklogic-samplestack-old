{"Body":"<p>A good question, and a very basic one that illustrates<br>\nan important difference between Phonetics and Phonology (or, as it used to be called, Phonemics):\nThey use different criteria for what's a vowel and what's a consonant.</p>\n\n<p>First, an important caveat:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is <strong>only</strong> true of English; i.e, it's the <strong>English</strong> phoneme /h/ we're talking about.<br>\n(This is <strong>not</strong>, for example, true of the Malay phoneme /h/.)<br>\nPhonemes and Phonology are localized to individual languages,<br>\nwhereas Phonetics is independent of individual language systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What that means is that when an English speaker pronounces the words </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>heat, hit, hate, hen, hat, hot,</em><br>\nfor instance,</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>they are pronouncing the phoneme strings </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>/hit/, /hɪt/, /het/, /hɛn/, /hæt/, /hat/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/modestproposal.pdf\">Phonemically</a>, and using /h/ as a Phonological <strong>consonant</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Phonological</em></strong> consonants are sounds that pattern in some language on the <strong>borders</strong> of syllables,<br>\nand are <strong>not</strong> used in those language as syllable nuclei like voiced vowels are in English.  </p>\n\n<p>The key word here is <strong><em>Pattern</em></strong>.<br>\nPhonology is all about the patterns sounds fit into in a given language.<br>\nIn English, /h/ <strong>patterns</strong> as a consonant, and that's that.</p>\n\n<p>However, in pronouncing those phoneme strings<br>\n -- which represent the way <strong>speakers</strong> hear the words --<br>\nthe actual /h/ sounds that the speaker says can be classified physiologically as voiceless vowels,<br>\nbecause a <strong><em>Phonetic</em></strong> vowel is defined by how it's pronounced,<br>\nrather than how it patterns with other sounds. </p>\n\n<p>Phonetic vowels are produced by passing lung air through the open mouth<br>\nand without significant contact between any articulators.<br>\nI.e, vowels are differentiated only by the positions of the tongue and the lips.</p>\n\n<p>For historical reasons, English /h/ only occurs before vowels.<br>\nIt <strong>never</strong> occurs before a consonant, or at the end of a word (i.e, before <code>Zero</code>).<br>\nIt used to occur everywhere, but those /h/'s went silent or mutated,<br>\nand are represented in English spelling as GH.<br>\nWhich is why words with GH in them are so perplexing.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the biggest difference between an /h/ and a following vowel is that<br>\nthe vowel is <strong>voiced</strong>, whereas the /h/ is <strong>voiceless</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Further, there is not much friction necessary to distinguish an /h/ from its absence,\nwhich is the only thing it contrasts with, so all that is really needed is a transition<br>\nbetween voiceless and voiced occurring after the vowel has started.<br>\nRather like the Greek concept of a \"rough breathing\" (Greek only had /h/ before vowels, too).  </p>\n\n<p>And the easiest way to accomplish this reliably and efficiently turned out to be<br>\nto pronounce /h/ with a different allophone for every vowel it preceded, like</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[i̥it], [ɪ̥ɪt], [e̥et], [ɛ̥ɛn], [æ̥æt], [ḁat]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A vowel symbol with a circle below represents a voiceless (whispered) vowel.<br>\nAny English speaker can prove this to themself easily:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>whisper <em>eat, it, ate, ett, at, ott</em>, holding the vowel long, to hear its voiceless sound<br>\nthen whisper each vowel, but start voicing the vowel and continue with the word.<br>\nYou'll hear an /h/ in each case, if you're an Engish native speaker.<br>\nAnd, if you're paying attention, you'll notice you don't move your tongue -- only your larynx<br>\nwhich means you're saying a different voiceless vowel in each case.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>English has no other uses for voiceless vowels,<br>\nso they're available as allophones for /h/.<br>\nLanguage rarely wastes resources.</p>\n", "Id":"4836", "ParentId":"4834", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2013-11-02T18:19:17.473", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[],
