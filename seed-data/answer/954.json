{"Body":"<p>I think you already got exhaustive answers to your question. For my part, I would like to point out that your question is based on a false assumption that people think in a particular language. Here's a nice quote for you:</p>\n\n<p>\"Most cognitively oriented linguists (e.g. Jackendoff, 1992; Pinker, 1994)\nargue that humans think in a non-linguistic format (Pinker calls it <strong>mentalese</strong>)\nwhich we map automatically and without conscious control onto the structures of\nparticular languages like English or French. We then use these structures, either\nin our heads to regulate our thoughts consciously (<strong>inner speech</strong>), or in the external\nmodalities of speech, writing or sign, for communication with others. You may have\nhad the experience of dreaming in a language you’re learning, and perhaps you can\neven recall dreamed conversations in it. Again, although these impressions can\nseem very vivid, they are not evidence that we think in language. We can wrap our\nthought in language, and this is clearly how we co-construct many of our beliefs\nabout the world with other speakers, as psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky (1986)\nhave pointed out. But this doesn’t mean that language and thought are the same\nthing.\" (Hall, Smith, &amp; Wicaksono. 2011. <em>Mapping applied linguistics: A guide for students and practitioners</em>)</p>\n", "Id":"954", "ParentId":"949", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T15:36:16.413", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-04T17:38:27.227", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-04T17:38:27.227", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
