{"Body":"<p>I'll mention just one of the aspects I have seen myself.</p>\n\n<p>When I spoke to Prof. Pollard, who, I suppose, can be considered to be a paper-and-pencil linguist, I believe he said that the reason he did HPSG, and not the more logic-driven approach he is pursuing now (<a href=\"http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~pollard/cvg\" rel=\"nofollow\">CVG</a>) was simply that he did not know logic at the time. The slides for his course on such a formalism are at <a href=\"http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/logical-grammar/page.php?id=materials\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/logical-grammar/page.php?id=materials</a>. In any case, doing derivations for sentences in such a grammar is exactly like doing derivations in mathematical logic.</p>\n\n<p>Coming to my point now, from what I've seen, which isn't much, it's not NLP/CL that's the cutting edge of linguistics, it's mathematics. But this does address the aspects you raised about computability and formal specification.</p>\n\n<p>A note about Pollard's logical grammar: it addresses 3 aspects of sentences: phonology, syntax and semantics, all with exactly the same, logic-based methods.</p>\n", "Id":"254", "ParentId":"150", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2011-09-17T13:39:48.527", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-17T14:43:14.940", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-17T14:43:14.940", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
