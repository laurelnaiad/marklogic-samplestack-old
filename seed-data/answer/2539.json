{"Body":"<p>I'm just going to tackle the \"terminology\" aspect of your question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Diphthongs (and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triphthong\" rel=\"nofollow\">triphthongs</a>) are a kind of vowel. You can contrast them with \"pure vowels\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Pure vowels have a single \"target\" where diphthongs (etc) have two (or more) targets. So for the English vowel sound in \"pie\" the first target is like the \"a\" in \"car\" and the second target is like the \"ee\" in \"fee\". This seems to be unintuitive for many people not acquainted with linguistics and could be compounded in English where the spelling of diphthongs often doesn't reflect its components.</p></li>\n<li><p>Semivowels can function as either vowels or consonants, depending on their context (what comes before and after them).</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"2539", "ParentId":"2538", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2012-09-07T08:14:13.797", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-07T08:36:22.690", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-07T08:36:22.690", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
