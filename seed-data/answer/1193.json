Both arguments have been proposed. Here is a (very brief) summary of the main points in Crowley and Bowern 2010 (13.3.4 Variation in small communities). On the one hand, it's easier to enforce language norms in small communities. On the other hand, social networks are denser in small societies (i.e. change will spread easier/faster), not in towns. Thus, Crowley and Bowern, while discussing language change in small communities in Melanesia and Aboriginal Australia, conclude that \"linguists do not yet know the answer.\"</p>\n\n<p>Also, social prestige is a very ambiguous term in the sense of what is considered prestigious is different for different social groups. Living in town is not universally \"desirable\" in all societies.</p>\n\n<p>William Labov is the \"god\" of sociolinguistics. You should read his works on this problem.</p>\n", "Id":"1193", "ParentId":"1188", "CreationDate":"2011-12-22T17:44:58.673", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-22T17:44:58.673", "CommentCount":"1"}
