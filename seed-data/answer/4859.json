For simple, concrete words like <em>fire</em>, it's less of a problem. But consider a word like <em>up</em>. It has many different senses that would all need to be translated into different words in those other languages: it can mean \"upwards\", \"finished\", etc. Or consider a word like <em>certainly</em>. It can mean \"as is certain\", but also \"granted\" as in a concession. Etc. That's why even the simplest dictionaries have multiple senses for most words.
