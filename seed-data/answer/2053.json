In modern Greek, due to the sound changes /b/->/v/ and /ɛː/->/i/ this would be pronounced /vi/, so it is no longer used. The modern Greek onomatopoeia for the sheep's sound is now <strong>μπε</strong> /be/.</p></li>\n<li><p>In Middle English <strong>pipen</strong> was the sound made by little birds. Due to the <a href=\"http://eweb.furman.edu/~mmenzer/gvs/\">Great Vowel Shift</a>, this became our modern word \"pipe\" /pajp/ which we don't use to imitate a bird. Instead we introduced new words <strong>peep</strong> and <strong>cheep</strong>. </p></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"2053", "ParentId":"2052", "CreationDate":"2012-06-05T23:40:26.053", "Score":"16", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"537", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-05T23:40:26.053", "CommentCount":"2"}
