{"Body":"<p>The Sino-Tibetan language family is rather large with around 450 languages (making it slightly larger than the Indo-European family by some counts). Within the Sino-Tibetan family you have the Tibeto-Burman family, which has around 430 members, making it a disproportionately large sub-family. The other 15 or so languages are in the Chinese family, which are those heavily isolating languages, but the  majority of the Tibeto-Burman group are relatively agglutinating. Many of the Central Bodic languages I work on have at least affixed tense, aspect, negation, plurals and case marking.</p>\n", "Id":"18", "ParentId":"2", "LastEditorUserId":"50", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:50:42.213", "OwnerUserId":"64", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-14T02:15:57.733", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"50", "AccountId":"15632", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"411", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:11:04.557", "DisplayName":"Timwi", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-07T19:26:30.213"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T02:15:57.733", "Score":"13", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"126", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.superlinguo.com", "Id":"64", "AccountId":"900445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:45:12.903", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a PhD in linguistics.
