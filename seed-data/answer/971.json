(4)--(6), on the other hand, have only one reading, i.e. \"It's not the case that I learned that Thomas will come.\" It seems the generalization to make is that the dropped complement versions tilt heavily towards the reading that is blocked off by factive verbs. But there are exceptions, like (7), so this cannot be an airtight account. </p>\n\n<p>(7) I didn't realize that Thomas will come. / I didn't realize Thomas will come.</p>\n", "Id":"971", "ParentId":"745", "CreationDate":"2011-11-07T01:46:50.120", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-07T01:46:50.120", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
