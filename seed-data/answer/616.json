It doesn't seem typologically sound to speak of trends of this nature among entire language subgroups, much less linguistic families. Further, as one commenter mentioned, the families you speak of contain entirely different languages in terms of their structure. Such comparisons are meaningless at this level.</p>\n\n<p>It can be said that all changes in case are essentially reassignments, however. Consider English, which now has only a hint of a nominative and accusative case in pronominal constructions. Its dative case was lost (essentially) by having it folded into its accusative. A language will never experience an absolute gain or loss spontaneously â€“ it always occurs through reassignment.</p>\n", "Id":"616", "ParentId":"588", "CreationDate":"2011-09-29T17:55:00.403", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"352", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-29T17:55:00.403", "CommentCount":"2"}
