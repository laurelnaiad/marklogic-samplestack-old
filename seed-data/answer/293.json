{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>At least some dialects of French also affricate apico-dental stops before i and u.  Polish and Brazilian Portuguese affricate and palatalize t and d before i, and Polish palatalizes s in the same environment, distinguishing si from sz (see Schenker 1966).</p>\n\n<p>With regard to Japanese, the phonetic situation is very interesting.  The affrication of t and d before all high vowels is the addition of a groove (down the middle of the tongue) articulation instead of a sudden release to the stop.  S appears to be unaffected, because it is already articulated with a groove.  All three are also palatalized or fronted (articulation shifted to the frontum of the tongue) before the front vowel i.</p>\n", "Id":"293", "ParentId":"219", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T14:48:45.700", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"73", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-19T14:48:45.700", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"73", "AccountId":"553104", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"307", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:11:52.640", "DisplayName":"Bill Sullivan", "LastAccessDate":"2011-09-23T20:52:44.300"}}
