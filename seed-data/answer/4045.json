The survey made a distinction between the \"vocative\" and the \"insistent vocative\" (you can read in the methodology section about how the two were elicited), and interestingly there were some cases where one involved a minor third at the end and the other didn't and some cases where both involved a minor third but the \"insistent vocative\" just placed the minor third interval higher in the speaker's vocal range.</p>\n", "Id":"4045", "ParentId":"1336", "CreationDate":"2013-07-23T16:35:26.530", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"385", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-23T16:35:26.530", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
