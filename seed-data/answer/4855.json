{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Jon -- you're a bit confused when you say \"initial\" vs. \"terminal\". All the Grimm's Law changes happened in all positions (except directly after an obstruent).</p>\n\n<p>As others have mentioned, it's impossible to say for sure why a particular change happens, but there are various plausible theories, e.g.:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>An initial chain shift d -> t, t -> th (aspirated stop) is extremely common. Aspiration of initial voiceless stops is common, and if that happened then d would naturally shift to t through economy of effort, and in turn dh would shift to d. Aspirated stops changing to fricatives are also common (e.g. happened in Greek).</li>\n<li>It's also possible that t shifted directly to a fricative; this is more likely to have begun intervocalically and expanded to other positions. If this happened, then d -> t followed by dh -> d would also be natural changes.</li>\n<li>It could have also been a push chain. The t - d - dh system is typologically very rare and obviously dispreferred, and so there would be pressure to eliminate the dh. If dh started to shift to d, then either it would merge with d or force a chain shift. Both solutions are seen (dh -> d in Balto-Slavic, Celtic, Iranian, etc.; chain shift in Germanic and Armenian).</li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"4855", "ParentId":"2826", "CreationDate":"2013-11-06T03:30:40.977", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2597", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-06T03:30:40.977", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2597", "AccountId":"539422", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"191", "CreationDate":"2013-10-15T04:14:37.920", "DisplayName":"Urban Vagabond", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-06T03:51:16.427"}}
