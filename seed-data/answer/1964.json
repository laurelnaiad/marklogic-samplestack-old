{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I believe that some linguists interpret contemporary informal French as a null-subject language, mainly because the phonemic stature of French subject pronouns has diminished over time. A paper by Elly van Gelderen (The Subject Cycle: Linguistic Change and Cognitive Principles, [2007]) perhaps suggest as much. If this is the case, and as the source language of French (namely, Latin) was a null-subject language, is an unorthodox analysis of intermediate forms of French at all possible: to wit, French has never been a non-null-subject language, as English is? I in no way have the expertise to answer this question, but I do not believe that standard prescriptivist accounts of French grammar are indications in themselves of the non-null-subject state of the language. Possibly only the historical record can determine the validity of this unorthodox assertion. That is, examples of subject-less clauses within the historical corpus of unstylized, informal French might affirm the thesis, and examples of unstylized clauses wherein a free morpheme intervenes between subject pronoun and verb phrase (full syntactic configurability assumed) might disprove the thesis.</p>\n", "Id":"1964", "ParentId":"1408", "CreationDate":"2012-05-20T04:11:14.483", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1030", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-20T04:11:14.483", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1030", "AccountId":"1499485", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"31", "CreationDate":"2012-05-19T03:30:31.323", "DisplayName":"Polytope", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-01T17:41:08.640"}}
