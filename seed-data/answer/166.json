{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The existence of a double-ð does not necessarily imply that the affricate was released twice, any more than other doubled stops are released twice. More likely the stop portion of the affricate was geminated, but the affricate was only released once. For comparison, consider modern Italian orthography, in which the letter <em>z</em> represents /ts/, but double <em>zz</em> is extremely common. This double letter does <em>not</em> indicate [t͡st͡s], but rather [t:s].</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, I see no reason to dispute the standard reconstruction of the tau gallicum. In particular, I find the suggestion that it could be [θ] to be very unlikely, given the available evidence.</p>\n", "Id":"166", "ParentId":"136", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T11:50:51.183", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"91", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-15T11:50:51.183", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"132", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jsbangs.com", "Id":"91", "AccountId":"5121", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T01:49:40.413", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a degree in Linguistics, but I work as a programmer.
