{"Body":"<p>Being Thai, I'm pretty sure that the resemblance is merely coincidental. The words for \"<em>fish</em>\", and \"<em>swim</em>\" in Thai are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>fish: ปลา <code>[plaː]</code><BR>\n  swim: ว่าย <code>[wâːi]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thai has a word for \"<em>fish</em>\" that was borrowed from Pali/Sanskrit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>มัจฉา <code>[mát-tɕʰǎː]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which sounds not very close to the mentioned Slavic word.</p>\n\n<p>I'm more curious in how words like \"elephant\", \"avatar\", \"immortal\", which Thai borrowed from Pali/Sanskrit as เอราวัณ <code>[eː-raː-wán]</code> อวตาร <code>[à-wá-taːn]</code> อมตะ <code>[à-má-tàʔ]</code>, sound like in Slavic. (NOTE: The more common word for elephants, which is not a borrowed word, in Thai is ช้าง <code>[tɕʰáːŋ]</code>.)</p>\n", "Id":"2819", "ParentId":"2803", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2012-11-10T13:37:06.807", "OwnerUserId":"1482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-11T06:05:55.793", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-11T06:05:55.793", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"12", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1482", "AccountId":"850963", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"191", "CreationDate":"2012-11-10T13:37:06.807", "DisplayName":"Damkerng T.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T17:53:11.193"}}
