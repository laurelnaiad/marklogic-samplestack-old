{"Body":"<p>It is very tempting to analyse it as a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_phrase\" rel=\"nofollow\">set phrase</a></em>, and indeed it is leaning toward being one. </p>\n\n<p>However, it is still possible to break it down, and, for instance, put an adjective before \"mode\" to qualify it : \"à la nouvelle mode\", meaning more or less \"newly fashionable\". Or after it : \"à la mode française\", meaning \"in the french fashion\". </p>\n\n<p>Compare this to French set phrase \"pour le moment\". It is <strong>not</strong> possible to add an adjective qualifying \"moment\", either before or after it. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I think it is still better to analyse \"à la mode\" as a full-fledged prepositional phrase. </p>\n", "Id":"4595", "ParentId":"4593", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2013-09-30T20:06:08.413", "OwnerUserId":"2105", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-03T10:14:28.147", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-03T10:14:28.147", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"50", "WebsiteUrl":"http://baalhammon.fr", "Location":"France", "Id":"2105", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"2818685", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"185", "CreationDate":"2013-05-26T19:57:56.107", "DisplayName":"Typhon", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T17:08:53.360", "AboutMe":""}}
