{"Body":"<p>In Turkish (I am a native speaker) word order, or more correctly the <em>order of the constituents</em> of a sentence (because, e.g., postpositions still have to <em>follow</em> their complements) is more or less free. The neutral order is SOV and other orderings are mainly used to emphasize an element. Generally, the element that immediately precedes the verb is emphasized. (Ali = a Turkish first name; d端n = yesterday; okula = to (the) school (dative of \"okul\"); gitti = went (3rd person singular, past tense))</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ali d端n okula gitti. (Ali went to school yesterday.)\nD端n okula Ali gitti. (It was Ali who went to school yesterday.)\nAli okula d端n gitti. (It was yesterday that Ali went to school.)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please note that in spoken Turkish, stress alone can be used for emphasis with any word order.</p>\n\n<p>Non verb-final orderings are also possible and frequent in colloquial and poetic language. Within the latter, even constituents of phrases can be broken apart and moved around. So, word order can also be a stylistic device.</p>\n", "Id":"1523", "ParentId":"1476", "LastEditorUserId":"805", "CreationDate":"2012-03-01T00:05:57.143", "OwnerUserId":"805", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-01T00:21:46.160", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"20", "Location":"Istanbul, Turkey", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"805", "AccountId":"538434", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"347", "CreationDate":"2012-02-29T19:39:29.067", "DisplayName":"cyco130", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T03:11:01.960", "AboutMe":"<p>Musician, amateur programmer and amateur linguist.
