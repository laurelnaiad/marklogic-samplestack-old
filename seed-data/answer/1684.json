{"Body":"<p>As I understand it this is an evolution from the PIE reflexive to a new mediopassive. </p>\n\n<p>PIE is often reconstructed as having <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286368/Indo-European-languages/74556/Morphology-and-syntax?anchor=ref603307\" rel=\"nofollow\">two voices</a>, active and mediopassive. Classical Latin had separate <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Latin/Lesson_2-Active_v_Passive\" rel=\"nofollow\">verb forms in <strong>-r</strong></a> that marked the mediopassive. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Celtic#Forms\" rel=\"nofollow\">This -r form was also found throughout Italoceltic</a>, Tocharian, and Hittite.) </p>\n\n<p>Separately, PIE <strong>*se-</strong> -> Classical Latin <strong>sē</strong> (<strong>sēsē</strong>, <strong>sibi</strong>, <strong>suī</strong>) was almost purely a reflexive marker, with some use as a reciprocal marker (e.g. <strong>inter sē</strong>). </p>\n\n<p>As the Romance languages developed, the <strong>-r</strong> mediopassive became disused even for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deponent_verb#Latin\" rel=\"nofollow\">deponent</a> verbs. I'm not confident why this happened; perhaps it was due to forms becoming homophonous. Anyway, with the loss of the old mediopassive a new form was adopted for the voice.  The reflexive <strong>sē</strong> filled this role. In the daughter languages <strong>sē</strong> -> <em>Fr, Es, Pt, Ro</em> <strong>se</strong>, <em>It</em> <strong>si</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So in Portuguese, and many of the other Romance languages, the reflexive/reciprocal and mediopassive are formed using <strong>se</strong>. The \"subject indetermination\" and \"passiving\" functions you describe use <strong>se</strong> as part of this new \"mediopassive\"; i.e., indeterminate or impersonal subjects regarded as a middle voice. </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Miller (2010) has a treatment of this question in \"<a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof%3aoso/9780199583430.001.0001/acprof-9780199583430-chapter-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Mediopassive: Latin to Romance</a>\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reflexive sē\n  forms replaced the ‐r forms in different structures at different\n  times.
