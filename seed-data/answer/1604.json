{"Body":"<p>In native <strong>Turkic</strong> phonology, [k] and [ḱ] are allophones; [k] only occurs in a back environment, while [ḱ] only in a front environment. The same goes for [g] : [ǵ] and [l] : [ĺ], and no other consonant. Examples from Turkish:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[kara] 'black' : [ḱere] 'time(s)'</p>\n  \n  <p>[ak] 'white' : [eḱ] 'addition'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In loanwords, however, this distribution is disturbed, e.g. [ḱ] can occur in a back environment in Turkish ([kar] 'snow' : [ḱar] 'profit'), but [k] still can't occur in a front environment. In Bashkir, where the opposition has shifted from [k] : [ḱ] to [q] : [k], the latter can be found in a back environment, too, but I'm not sure whether [q] can be found in a front one.</p>\n\n<p>All examples off the top of my head, but can be found in probably any Turkic grammar. (Only I'd suggest, if you settle for Turkish, that you use e.g. Ersen-Rasch (in German) or Stachowski (in Polish) because all English grammars I know of are not terribly good in my opinion.)</p>\n\n<p>As a counter example, in <strong>Polish</strong>, *[k] and *[g] have been conserved in all surroundings except before [i] (&lt; *[y]) and [e], where, in the Middle Ages, they > [ḱ] and [ǵ], respectively. Examples:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>*[kara] 'penalty' > [kara], *[gnetõ] 'I squeeze' > [gńotẽ]</p>\n  \n  <p>*[kyjь] 'stick' > [ḱij], *[nogy] 'legs' > [noǵi]</p>\n  \n  <p>*[kъlъ] 'fang' > [ḱew], *[gъzъ] 'gadfly' > [ǵes]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, in Polish exactly the same thing happened with *[p] and *[b].</p>\n\n<p>All examples from Mańczak W. 1983, <em>Polska fonetyka i morfologia historyczna</em>, Warszawa.</p>\n", "Id":"1604", "ParentId":"1603", "LastEditorUserId":"794", "CreationDate":"2012-03-08T22:10:50.347", "OwnerUserId":"794", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-08T22:31:49.680", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-08T22:31:49.680", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}}
