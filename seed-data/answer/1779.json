{"Body":"<p>Aramaic and Spanish are of entirely different language families: Semitic (a branch of Afroasiatic) and Romance (a branch of Indo-European), respectively. I am not aware of much contact between the two languages, so it is unlikely that one borrowed words or constructions from the other.</p>\n\n<p>What you heard in the film was most likely Latin, the ancestor of all the Romance languages, like Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Romanian. And Latin's daughter languages still resemble her a great deal, especially with respect to vocabulary. Notice also how many words English has borrowed from French and Latin: you should be able to recognise various words you know in English when you hear Latin, like <em>entirely, different, language, family,</em> etc (Latin <em>integer, differens, lingua, familia</em>).</p>\n", "Id":"1779", "ParentId":"1777", "LastEditorUserId":"941", "CreationDate":"2012-04-12T18:11:11.377", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-19T18:03:34.887", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"9", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.didyoulearnanything.net", "Location":"Germany", "Id":"941", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"522746", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"317", "CreationDate":"2012-04-19T09:51:50.690", "DisplayName":"michaelsappir", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-14T14:20:51.253", "Age":"26"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-19T18:03:34.887", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
