{"Body":"<p>The only Italian colony with any substantial settlement was Libya which mostly occurred in the 1930s. Just before WWII over 100,000 or 1/8 of the inhabitants were Italian settlers, or <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-libici\" rel=\"nofollow\">Italo-Libyans</a>, many of whom left during and after the war. A common estimate for 1962 is 35.000 Italians in Libya. They were ordered to leave after al-Gaddafi took power, though it seems there was still some 1,500 in the country by 1982.</p>\n\n<p>There was simply no time for a Libyan Italian dialect to evolve.</p>\n", "Id":"5996", "ParentId":"3505", "LastEditorUserId":"2708", "CreationDate":"2013-11-24T19:10:24.513", "OwnerUserId":"2708", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-25T03:30:09.457", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"122", "Location":"South Carolina", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2708", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/100002552955579/picture?type=large", "AccountId":"3562877", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"353", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T20:18:34.430", "DisplayName":"Mario Elocio", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:34:20.273"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-25T03:30:09.457", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"122", "Location":"South Carolina", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2708", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/100002552955579/picture?type=large", "AccountId":"3562877", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"353", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T20:18:34.430", "DisplayName":"Mario Elocio", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:34:20.273"}}
