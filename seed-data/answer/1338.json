{"Body":"<p>In general, talk of syntactic <em>derivations</em> as top-down versus bottom-up is understood to be purely metaphorical:  the theory of grammar aims to explain static knowledge, not dynamic process. A forthcoming paper considers <a href=\"http://ling.umd.edu/~shevaun/publications/Phillips&amp;Lewis_2009.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">how to understand directionality of derivation for syntactic <em>processing</em> (and what that may imply for an adequate theory of syntactic <em>competence</em>)</a>. From the introduction: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Generative grammars are typically framed as theories of speakers’\n  task‐independent knowledge of their language, and these are understood\n  to be distinct from theories of how specific communicative tasks might\n  put that knowledge to use. [...] In the most popular current version\n  of the derivational approach, derivations proceed ‘upwards’, starting\n  from the most deeply embedded terminal elements in the sentence, which\n  are often towards the right of a sentence (e.g., Chomsky, 1995;\n  Carnie, 2006). Such derivations tend to proceed in a right‐to‐left\n  order, which is probably the opposite of the order in which sentences\n  are assembled in everyday tasks such as speaking and understanding.\n  ... [yet there] are a number of recent proposals that various\n  linguistic phenomena can be better understood in terms of derivations\n  that incrementally assemble structures in a (roughly) left‐to‐right\n  order. [...] it is hard to avoid the question of whether it is\n  mere coincidence that left‐to‐right derivations track the order in\n  which sentences are spoken and understood. It is also natural to ask\n  how left‐to‐right derivations impact the psychological commitments of\n  grammatical theories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In brief, whether speech error data is relevant to the question of derivational order in syntax depends on just how much explanation syntactic theory owes to a theory of linguistic performance.</p>\n", "Id":"1338", "ParentId":"1313", "LastEditorUserId":"178", "CreationDate":"2012-01-28T00:13:10.727", "OwnerUserId":"178", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-01T03:05:48.123", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-01T03:05:48.123", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"56", "WebsiteUrl":"http://ling.umd.edu/~wellwood", "Location":"College Park, MD", "Id":"178", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"922214", "Views":"88", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T23:20:44.103", "DisplayName":"Alexis Wellwood", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-12T15:15:17.400", "AboutMe":"<p>Other relevant links for me are the University of Maryland <a href=\"http://phling.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHLING</a> and the <a href=\"http://languagescience.umd.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Language Science community</a>.</p>\n"}}
