{"Body":"<p>Indeed in the Proto-Indo-European language there is a known <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_s-mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">phenomenon called \"s-mobile\"</a>. Some roots in PIE could occasionally have an initial augment \"s-\". Since all PIE roots begin with a consonant, this gives initial \"sC-\" cluster. The meaning of this extension is not known. We only know that some words with a root had it while others did not. </p>\n\n<p>There is a theory that this initial s- could be result of fusion between the usual PIE ending -s/-os with the following word.</p>\n\n<p>But most of the examples you gave are irrelevant. </p>\n\n<p>The word for star in PIE was <strong><em>a̯ster</em></strong>, with the first phoneme being a laryngeal which was either lost or became a vowel. It is conjectured that the initial form was even more complicated: <strong><em>a̯e̯ster</em></strong> and related to <strong><em>a̯ee̯tr</em></strong>, \"fire\".</p>\n\n<p>Russian \"strana\" on the other hand, sometimes considered to derive from a root with s-mobile \"(s)tero̯-\" (<a href=\"http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny&amp;first=1&amp;off=&amp;text_root=%28s%29ter-1&amp;method_root=substring&amp;text_meaning=&amp;method_meaning=substring&amp;ic_meaning=on&amp;text_ger_mean=&amp;method_ger_mean=substring&amp;ic_ger_mean=on&amp;text_grammar=&amp;method_grammar=substring&amp;ic_grammar=on&amp;text_comments=&amp;method_comments=substring&amp;ic_comments=on&amp;text_derivative=&amp;method_derivative=substring&amp;ic_derivative=on&amp;text_material=&amp;method_material=substring&amp;ic_material=on&amp;text_ref=&amp;method_ref=substring&amp;ic_ref=on&amp;text_seealso=&amp;method_seealso=substring&amp;ic_seealso=on&amp;text_pages=&amp;method_pages=substring&amp;ic_pages=on&amp;text_any=&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=number&amp;ic_any=on\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pokorny</a>) which meant \"stretch\" but this root may be considered s-mobile erroneously due mixing with other roots (Starling gives this root with a solid s). </p>\n\n<p>The origin of the \"schnell\" and \"snell\" is unknown beyond Proto-Germanic.</p>\n\n<p>The word \"stamina\" origins from the root \"stea̯-\" which had no mobile \"s\" at least in the observable PIE stage.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of the \"spyros\" is also unknown.</p>\n", "Id":"4261", "ParentId":"4259", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2013-08-26T14:02:50.463", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-26T22:33:40.760", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-26T22:33:40.760", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
