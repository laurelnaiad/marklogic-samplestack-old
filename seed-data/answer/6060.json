{"Body":"<p>While there are lot of Adj/N pairs in English, your example seems to be of the specific type 'Nominal Adjectives' (e.g. 'the meek', 'the poor').</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't say they're nouns in their own right; you can't clearly swap them into other sentences ('A headstrong doesn't give up' or 'I'm looking for a headstrong'.)</p>\n\n<p>Even when it is true that there are identical N/Adj pairs, they're often nouns used as adjectives ('ham' in 'ham sandwich'); that is, 'noun adjuncts'.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there's a very common practice in English (very popular in recent marketing) of what you could call 'zero-derived deadjectival nouns': 'Think different', 'Eat fresh', etc. Less obviously marketing-based examples are things like 'I was attacked by some toughs'.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, English has a number of non-homophonous homonym N/Adj pairs: e.g. 'concrete'/'concrete'. However, even when such a pair is homophonous, it would be the same: a homonym/homophone pair of two distinct words.</p>\n", "Id":"6060", "ParentId":"6058", "LastEditorUserId":"657", "CreationDate":"2013-12-03T16:01:44.497", "OwnerUserId":"657", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-06T06:04:16.760", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"657", "AccountId":"1160318", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"526", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T02:11:47.230", "DisplayName":"Jeremy Needle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T15:40:44.497", "AboutMe":"<p>Sociolinguist.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-06T06:04:16.760", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"657", "AccountId":"1160318", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"526", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T02:11:47.230", "DisplayName":"Jeremy Needle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T15:40:44.497", "AboutMe":"<p>Sociolinguist.</p>\n"}}
