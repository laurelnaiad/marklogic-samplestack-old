{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>If you're trying to extract the topic of the text using the words of the text, there are some situations which you may encounter:</p>\n\n<p>1 - You have many samples of the same context (e.g. 20newseltter corpora) which many documents in different topics, and each topic labeled to the topic. In this case you just need to do a simple classification on the new data in the same context i.e. you jave 20,000 documents in 20 topics, you give all these documents to a classifier (e.g. Naive Bayes Classifier) and the new document will be classified easily.</p>\n\n<p>2 - If you don't have any training data, you should use parsers (as I see you're trying the same), in this case you should build PCFGs from what you get from the parsers (POS taggers, name entity recognizers) return to you. This should be made on your type of data specifically and no general rule exists.</p>\n\n<p>3 - If there is a large number of data available but they aren't classified, another way is to use clustering. In many cases in NLP clustering doesn't do much to you but it is worth trying. The only thing you need to make clear for the system is the number of topics (clusters).</p>\n", "Id":"2759", "ParentId":"2643", "CreationDate":"2012-10-26T07:58:15.500", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1440", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-26T07:58:15.500", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.hushmandsazan.com", "Id":"1440", "AccountId":"191833", "CreationDate":"2012-10-24T19:06:28.160", "AboutMe":"<p>Computer Engineer ;-)</p>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"Tehran, Iran", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"183", "DisplayName":"MOLi", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-30T11:05:50.683"}}
