{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It depends on what is meant by \"[b]\".</p>\n\n<p>Usually, <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/301/when-should-one-use-slashes-or-square-brackets-when-transcribing-in-ipa\">a transcription in brackets means that it's a phonetic transcription</a>, which aims to represent the sounds uttered without considering whether the language makes a phonemic distinction between them.</p>\n\n<p>Under the strictest interpretation, [b] is voiced by definition, since that IPA symbol represents the <em>voiced bilabial plosive</em>. In other words, the \"cardinal\" or prototypical value of [b] is voiced.</p>\n\n<p>But more commonly, phonetic transcriptions can also be <em>broad</em>, meaning that they notate only the most salient features, or those that are likely to be linguistically significant. For instance, one can transcribe the American English word <em>buddy</em> as ⟨[ˈbʌɾ.i]⟩. This is clearly a phonetic rather than phonemic transcription, since it indicates the specific allophone ([ɾ]) of /d/ that gets used. But it is a broad transcription. In English, utterance-initial voiced stops are usually partially devoiced, which is rarely noticed by native speakers. So this transcription is using ⟨b⟩ to denote a partially-devoiced phone.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, even in a <em>narrow</em> (precise) transcription, ⟨b⟩ may be used to represent a voiceless phone when it is used with a diacritic. For instance, one might transcribe the Russian word <em>го́лубь</em> (<em>gólubj</em>) as [ˈgolˠʊb̥ʲ] to indicate that the final consonant, though phonetically voiceless, is an underlyingly voiced sound that is devoiced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final-obstruent_devoicing\" rel=\"nofollow\">a phonological process</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In a phonemic or morphophonemic transcription, the symbol ⟨b⟩ can easily refer to a voiceless stop. Many languages do not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. For example, Korean has a series of stops that vary between voiced and (tenuis) unvoiced. Authors can somewhat arbitrarily pick which allophone to use to transcribe each phoneme; in this case, one might pick the voiced IPA symbols to help distinguish them from Korean's 2 other series of voiceless stops. Then the word ⟨불고기⟩ would be phonemically transcribed as /bul.ɡo.ɡi/, even though the initial consonant is voiceless.</p>\n", "Id":"3102", "ParentId":"3093", "CreationDate":"2013-01-22T01:35:49.603", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1021", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-22T01:35:49.603", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"176", "WebsiteUrl":"https://launchpad.net/~replicator-snail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KPUcH.png", "Id":"1021", "AccountId":"124682", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T02:34:01.443", "AboutMe":"<p>.
