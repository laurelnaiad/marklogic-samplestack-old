{"Body":"<p>It seems to me that the fundamental difference between nouns and verbs is that verbs form sentences. You can't create a sentence without a verb, and nouns in a sentence are always parameters assigned to something else, unlike verbs which can be freestanding (although they may require nouns or other verbs to be supplied as parameters, as \"He\" is a parameter of \"He rests\".)</p>\n\n<p>I don't know a lot about language universals, but another striking feature of verbs in many languages is that they have a variety of syntactic formats, such that many verbs accept multiple formats, but no verb accepts all formats:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Intransitive: <code>I eat.</code></li>\n<li>Transitive:  <code>I eat bread.</code></li>\n<li>With a particle: <code>I eat it up.</code></li>\n<li>Three arguments: <code>I show the monster a cookie.</code></li>\n<li>Three arguments: <code>I put the monster in a cage.</code> (*I put the monster)</li>\n<li>Verb chain (1): <code>I try to stop.</code></li>\n<li>Verb chain (2): <code>I stop eating.</code></li>\n<li>Subordinate clause: <code>I hope (that) you're happy</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is <em>in addition</em> to \"standard\" parameters and complexities that most/all verbs in a language support, such as auxiliary verbs, negatives, and conjugations.</p>\n\n<p>Nouns have several optional parts that can hang off them, but almost any noun (other than verbal nouns, i.e. gerunds) uses the same syntax: <code>the important pen from Earth</code> (note that \"pen\" could be virtually any noun).</p>\n", "Id":"1047", "ParentId":"763", "LastEditorUserId":"519", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T00:51:32.333", "OwnerUserId":"519", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-19T01:35:05.380", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "WebsiteUrl":"http://loyc-etc.blogspot.com", "Location":"Alberta, Canada", "Id":"519", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"11756", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"149", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T00:30:16.290", "DisplayName":"Qwertie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-04T20:45:15.840"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-19T01:35:05.380", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "WebsiteUrl":"http://loyc-etc.blogspot.com", "Location":"Alberta, Canada", "Id":"519", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"11756", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"149", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T00:30:16.290", "DisplayName":"Qwertie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-04T20:45:15.840"}}
