Here's how you would analyze your examples, according to Huddleston and Pullum 2002 and 2005:</p>\n\n<p><em>She found him lying on the bed.</em></p>\n\n<p>‘Found him lying on the bed’ is <strong>a gerund-participial non-finite clause</strong>.  It is also a plain-complex catenative construction. The verb ‘find’ here is a catenative verb and it belongs to class 3Cii (HP 2002). ‘Him’ is a direct object and ‘lying on the bed’ is a depictive object-oriented (objective) predicative complement.</p>\n\n<p><em>She found him injured.</em></p>\n\n<p>'Him' is a direct object, 'injured' is a depictive object-oriented (objective) predicative complement. <strong>'Find' is a complex-transitive verb here</strong>. 'Injured' is an adjective here - it allows modification, e.g. badly/severely injured.</p>\n\n<p><em>She found a note left on the table.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>The past-participle non-finite clause</strong> ‘left on the table’ modifies the NP ‘note’ – so it is an adjunct of spatial location (HP 2002, Chapter 8, §4). It is essentially equivalent to a finite relative clause: 'which/that was left on the table'.</p>\n\n<p><em>She found the suspects involved in the robbery.</em></p>\n\n<p>‘The suspects’ is a direct object, ‘involved in the robbery’ is a depictive object-oriented (objective) predicative complement. <strong>'Find' is a complex-transitive verb here.</strong> 'Involved'  is an adjective here - it allows modification, e.g. deeply involved.</p>\n", "Id":"1839", "ParentId":"1654", "CreationDate":"2012-04-25T18:34:32.990", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-25T18:34:32.990", "CommentCount":"4"}
