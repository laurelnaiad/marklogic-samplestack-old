However, if the verb has a prefix like pa-, iš- etc., the reflexive particle comes between this prefix and the stem.  For example:</p>\n\n<p>aiškinti  ‘to explain’</p>\n\n<p>paaiškinti  ‘to explain a little’</p>\n\n<p>aiškintis  ‘to explain oneself’</p>\n\n<p>pasiaiškinti  ‘to explain oneself a little bit;  (reciprocal) to resolve mutual disagreements’</p>\n\n<p>Is there a case for calling –si- an infix?  It seems like a simple question of prefix ordering.  But still, in languages like Latvian or Russian with generally similar verbal morphology, this movement doesn’t take place – the Latvian equivalent of the above series would be ‘skaidrot, paskaidrot, skaidroties, paskaidroties’.   Or looking at it another way, perhaps we could say that Lithuanian is averse to morphological discontinuity, since it stacks the prefixes in front.</p>\n", "Id":"5938", "ParentId":"5935", "CreationDate":"2013-11-20T02:50:20.960", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2619", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-20T02:50:20.960", "CommentCount":"2"}
