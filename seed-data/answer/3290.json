{"Body":"<p>Lambda calculus is often used in formal semantics to express the meaning of a sentence compositionally as a series of successive function applications. On <a href=\"http://people.umass.edu/partee/NZ_2006/NZ06_Ling_310.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barbara Partee's website</a> there's a nice lesson on how lambda calculus (or, as some say, <em>the</em> lambda calculus) can be used to model English semantics. Lesson 7 introduces lambda calculus, but it might be worth looking at earlier lessons to see why it is useful.</p>\n\n<p>For sure, lambda calculus is not \"calculus\" in the typical sense of differential calculus that we learn in our high school math classes, but it is a kind of calculus in that it involves an operator (lambda) that operates on a function and returns another function, binding a variable in the process. In that sense the lambda operator gives you something like the \"derivative\" of the original function.</p>\n", "Id":"3290", "ParentId":"3287", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "CreationDate":"2013-02-26T18:37:12.697", "OwnerUserId":"385", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-27T17:48:26.127", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
