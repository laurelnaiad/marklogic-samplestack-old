So, in my opinion, <strong>there is a difference between [dʲ] and [dj]</strong>. The former is <em>one (palatalized) sound</em>, the latter is <em>two sounds</em>, a voiced dental stop followed by a palatal approximant. I haven't checked it in Praat yet but I'm almost certain that you'll see that difference on a spectrogram.</p>\n\n<p>Although there are palatalized stops in Russian, I've never seen/read anyone talking about palatalized stops in English. I will be more than happy to \"get educated\", if I'm wrong.</p>\n", "Id":"1028", "ParentId":"206", "CreationDate":"2011-11-15T20:48:24.487", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-15T20:48:24.487", "CommentCount":"4"}
