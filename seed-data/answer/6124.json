{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The classical, pure versions of Mesoamerican languages used for the most part a base-20 system. If you go to some indigenous towns in rural Mexico, you may still listen to old people using base-20 numbers in modern versions of Maya, Nahuatl and a handful of other languages.</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, though, young people are adopting a base-10 numbering system similar to that of Spanish (when not preferring Spanish altogether), some other indigenous languages dropped the base-20 earlier. And then there's a very small, isolated indigenous language in northern Mexico which uses base-8. It's disappearing as well, so you'd better hurry and record number samples before it goes away.</p>\n", "Id":"6124", "ParentId":"2652", "CreationDate":"2013-12-12T16:15:47.757", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2785", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-12T16:15:47.757", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"79", "WebsiteUrl":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/21258/joe-pineda", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3829797d6709334d9a07fe18dfcb553f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2785", "AccountId":"11104", "CreationDate":"2013-11-26T03:56:44.347", "AboutMe":"<p>Developing professionally since 11 years ago.
