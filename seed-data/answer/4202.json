{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I'm surprised that nobody's mentioned the form/function distinction.</p>\n\n<p>Phonetics studies the nature (acoustic and articulatory) of sounds that human's produce while speaking. Phonology studies their function in differentiating meaning in various contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Thus (very crudely), phonetics will notice the difference between the aspirated and non-aspirated /p/ in pin vs. spin. But phonology will be mostly interested in the fact that the meaning of both words will change when you replace /p/ with /k/ in exactly the same way as in lip vs. lick where aspiration doesn't enter the picture. </p>\n\n<p>But of course, phonology can only be successful when it has good phonetics to rely on.</p>\n", "Id":"4202", "ParentId":"180", "CreationDate":"2013-08-16T06:50:39.100", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2121", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-16T06:50:39.100", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"13", "WebsiteUrl":"http://metaphorhacker.net", "Location":"UK", "Id":"2121", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"2843698", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"453", "CreationDate":"2013-06-01T07:00:55.230", "DisplayName":"Dominik Lukes", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T22:31:39.843", "AboutMe":"<p>My primary research is in figurative language and discourse but I've also taught intro to general linguistics, basic phonology and language and education.
