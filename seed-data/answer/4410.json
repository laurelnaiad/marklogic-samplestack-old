{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Even if Everett's analysis is correct (and I found his arguments convincing), it doesn't. It might well be the case that Pirah√£ doesn't make use of recursion but most languages clearly do. Note that there are varying levels of recursion. For example, the Andean languages use possessive recursion (\"the house of my Dad's aunt\") but no verbal recursion (there are no embedded sentences with finite verbs). Similarly, Old Indo-European used participles instead of (recursively) embedded sentences, etc.</p>\n", "Id":"4410", "ParentId":"1515", "CreationDate":"2013-09-09T19:04:12.630", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2451", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-09T19:04:12.630", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"54", "Location":"Prague, Czech Republic", "DownVotes":"3", "Id":"2451", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"935824", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"782", "CreationDate":"2013-09-09T18:11:01.840", "DisplayName":"Atamiri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:11:49.140", "Age":"36"}}
