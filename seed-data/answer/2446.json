{"Body":"<p>Hebrew and French are not related. I am unsure of any research on this specific topic, but it is not an uncommon thing to find a plural form being used to show respect. Telugu (a Dravidian language spoken in India... completely unrelated to both French and Hebrew) will do this as well. For example, when speaking to a person, if respect is shown you will refer to them using the 2nd person plural pronoun <em>meeru</em> rather than the singular <em>nuvu</em>. Using the singular form is only for either a close relationship (good friend or family member) or to be used when NOT showing respect (speaking to a child or an extreme inferior). When speaking of a superior or someone to whom respect is offered, plural is proper. This goes beyond the use of honorifics to 'add' more respect.</p>\n", "Id":"2446", "ParentId":"2445", "LastEditorUserId":"1266", "CreationDate":"2012-08-21T01:38:06.527", "OwnerUserId":"1266", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-01T13:34:47.733", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"UT", "Id":"1266", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1760544", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"51", "CreationDate":"2012-08-17T19:48:23.430", "DisplayName":"Brad Miller", "LastAccessDate":"2012-10-15T02:15:07.717", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a graduate student in Linguistics.
