{"Body":"<p>I'm not sure if there are languages that highlight the mass distinction in particular--the boundaries are of course less clear-cut than for number, but that doesn't mean a language wouldn't have two or three \"masses,\" with its speakers allowed to use either/multiple ones for masses at boundaries; however, there are languages that make finer, qualitative distinctions that correlate with mass/scale. For instance, in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=VfLZFtszOCQC&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;ots=egjlh2tvC4&amp;dq=the%20semantics%20of%20classification%20in%20koyukon%20athabascan&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Semantics of Classification in Koyukon Athabaskan</a> by Melissa Axelrod, we read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Koyukon Classificatory Verbs</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>G+ø+'o      'compact object is in position, is sitting there'\nG+ø+ton     'flat, rigid, or sticklike object is there'\nG+ø+lo      'plural objects are there'\nø+kko       'object in an open, shallow container is there'\nG+ɬ+ton     'bag or enclosed object is there'\nG+ɬ+kooɬ    'flat, flexible, or clothlike object is there'\nG+ɬ+koot    'food, edible object is there'\nde+ɬ+t'on   'burning object is there'\nG+de+dzok   'disorderly, scattered plural objects are there'\nG+de+tlaakk 'mushy, wet, messy object is there'\nde+de+nokk  'granular or powdery substance is there'\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The capital G refers to a gender prefix, which is chosen from:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Koyukon Gender Prefixes</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>ne-    faces, berries, beads, thimbles, string, rope\nde-    wood, plants, furniture, mittens, boots, rigid containers\ndene-  round, heavy objects: animal heads, cabbages, apples, rocks;\n       long, cylindrical objects: pipes, bridges, pencils, guns\nhu-    the areal prefix, used also to classify areas, events, abstractions\nhede-  weather\n(zero) people, animals\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She then works through an example changing classification and gender with flour, and its implications. It seems as though, if you were referring to rice, for instance, you might choose <em>G+ø+lo, G+de+dzok,</em> or <em>de+de+nokk</em> depending on whether it was just a few grains, several, or many, which would correlate with the mass. So this is somewhat related to the question.</p>\n", "Id":"521", "ParentId":"519", "LastEditorUserId":"84", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T03:21:59.533", "OwnerUserId":"84", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-26T03:40:21.337", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"167", "WebsiteUrl":"http://web.mit.edu/~dbriggs/www", "Id":"84", "AccountId":"511555", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:18:36.197", "AboutMe":"<p>At UMass Amherst in the Ph.D. program in math.<br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently taking:<br>\nAnalysis (Measure theory & integration)<br>\nGeometry (Theory of manifolds)<br>\nModular Forms</p>\n", "Age":"29", "Location":"Cambridge, MA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1163", "DisplayName":"Daniel Briggs", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-10T16:57:15.060"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-26T03:40:21.337", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"167", "WebsiteUrl":"http://web.mit.edu/~dbriggs/www", "Id":"84", "AccountId":"511555", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:18:36.197", "AboutMe":"<p>At UMass Amherst in the Ph.D. program in math.<br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently taking:<br>\nAnalysis (Measure theory & integration)<br>\nGeometry (Theory of manifolds)<br>\nModular Forms</p>\n", "Age":"29", "Location":"Cambridge, MA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1163", "DisplayName":"Daniel Briggs", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-10T16:57:15.060"}}
