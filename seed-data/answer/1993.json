{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Regarding the vowel charts in the question, it's important to be aware that these show the <strong>phonemic vowels</strong> of the languages. When placing vowel <strong>phonemes</strong> on the quadrilateral they are typically spaced out evenly, as we see in those charts. This is especially so when the vowel systems are neatly balanced, like the ones shown. This should not be taken as a claim that these are the precise values of the vowels. All it really claims is that these are the contrasting vowels of those languages and shows how they contrast. For example: from the chart for French I can see that it has an unrounded high front vowel (represented there by /y/) and another unrounded front vowel that contrasts in being slightly lower (represented by /ø/). A trained linguist, even if they had never before heard French (another weird and exotic IE language I believe), could use these as a rough guide and probably make a fair stab at pronouncing words containing these vowels.</p>\n\n<p>As described in other answers to this question, locating vowels precisely on the quadrilateral requires acoustic analysis. <a href=\"http://sail.usc.edu/~lgoldste/General_Phonetics/Vowels/Vowel_Theories.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> contains examples of vowel quadrilaterals based on auditory judgement and ones using measurement of formant frequencies.</p>\n", "Id":"1993", "ParentId":"137", "CreationDate":"2012-05-27T01:20:29.137", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-27T01:20:29.137", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ümlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}}
