My professional background includes mobile device and embedded programming (Android, Blackberry, J2ME, Motorola 68k processors), as well a variety of other desktop platforms (Java, MFC C++, Netbeans, etc), with a little experience with web-programming environments thrown in for good measure (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Spring, MySql, etc). </p>\n\n<p>One of my hobby projects is developing PopTrayU (<a href=\"http://poptrayu.sourceforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://poptrayu.sourceforge.net</a>), an open source email notifier written in Delphi. I had been using the original PopTray for about 10 years, and decided to learn enough Delphi to fix a couple pet bugs, since no one else seemed to have the knowledge, time, and inclination to do it themselves, and there hadn't been a new version released in over 7 years. Once I'd fixed that one bug, there was one more little thing I thought I could improve, and wouldn't it be fun if I could make this aspect of the application a little more customizable? And then there's that other bug...well, someday I'll get them all fixed, maybe :)</p>\n", "Age":"33", "Location":"California", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"Jessica Brown", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-14T05:39:19.823"}
