I work on Tlingit, a critically endangered language of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and southeast Alaska. I also have extensive interests in the related Athabaskan languages, language documentation theory and practice, orthography design, morphological theory, phonological theory, and the syntax of noun phrases and relativization.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using TeX and friends for more than a decade. I use Xe(La)TeX, fontspec, memoir, and BibLaTeX extensively, and I am working on a BibLaTeX style for linguistics publications. Other packages I use frequently include pst-jtree, expex, and booktabs. I’m learning PGF/TikZ and considering developing a library to produce autosegmental representation diagrams. I do my writing in TeXShop, and my TeX programming in MacVim, having abandoned FSF Emacs and XEmacs due to their perpetually disappointing Unicode rendering.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"5", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"866", "DisplayName":"James C.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-03T19:13:48.097"}
