I also did coursework in teaching English as a second language (TESL).  I have taught linguistics and ESL in the US, China, and Poland.  I was concerned for quite a few years about the shakiness of the \"scientific\" status of linguistics and eventually was convinced during the 1990's of its status as a branch of philosophy, not science, by Victor H. Yngve (see, e.g., Yngve's 1996 book <em>From Grammar to Science: New Foundations for General Linguistics</em>).  Linguistics as it is usually conducted is fraught with internal contradiction and unprovable assumptions.  Yngve has presented a way out, a framework called \"human linguistics\" or \"hard-science linguistics.\"  It is from that perspective that I now work.</p>\n"}
