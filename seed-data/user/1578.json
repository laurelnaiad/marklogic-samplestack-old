Basically I am trying to become skilled within quantitative analysis and statistics.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned VBA at my bachelor, which was also were I discovered that I like programming. I like when I get the feeling that I am creating something. I realize that I am moving away from my education, as marketing in the real world is just as much about trading and advertising as it is about clustering consumer groups and what follows. I also like to help people, and i believe that people make each-other stronger if they stay honest to each-other as well as their common and individual goals.</p>\n\n<p>If I can become skilled within quantitative analysis and at the same time have the fundamental theoretical understanding of consumers and economy, I believe I have a strong card at my hand. </p>\n\n<p>I dream about getting a PhD scholarship and specialize within data mining and text mining. If any of you out there knows a university to whom I might sound interesting, please feel free to let me know.</p>\n", "Age":"28"}
