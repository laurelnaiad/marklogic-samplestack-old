I am an active member of Programmers.SE and Stack Overflow. If you tried to check though, you would think that I'm rarely on SO. I seldom answer questions as I really don't have the knowledge to do so, or the question has already been thoroughly answered. I mainly read questions and answers to learn!</p>\n\n<p>On Programmers.SE, I'm \"Blog Overlord\"! Yes, <a href=\"http://programmers.blogoverflow.com/\">we do have a blog</a>. It's actually filled with great content. If you want to help out or write a post, ping me or World Engineer in the <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2359/programmers-blog\">Programmers Blog Chat Room</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I also oddly enjoy janitorial work around Stack Exchange. I tend to be close vote happy over on Programmers, and edit <em>tons</em> of questions! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Favorite Technologies</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perl</strong> - I don't care what anybody says, Perl is a great language. Plus, CPAN is amazing!</li>\n<li><strong>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</strong> - As a web developer, I <em>need</em> these languages. Who doesn't?</li>\n<li><strong>jQuery</strong> - To make Javascript awesome!</li>\n<li><strong>MySQL</strong> - Only database I ever use.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows</strong> - Mainly 7 &amp; 8. This is my school OS.</li>\n<li><strong>Linux</strong> - Specifically Ubuntu, but starting to use Arch Linux. This is my development OS.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Age":"15", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"Dynamic", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-16T21:39:12.580"}
