I edited and co-wrote a chapter on writing science fiction, published in a popular college textbook on fiction writing (<em>The Graceful Lie</em>, edited by Michael Petracca). I created and co-edited UNEARTH, a science fiction magazine devoted exclusively to discovering and publishing new writers, which launched many writing careers (name-drop: William Gibson). I'm a physician, film director, drummer, scuba diver, and golfer.</p>\n"}
