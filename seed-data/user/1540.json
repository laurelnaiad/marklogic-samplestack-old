Immediately after, I started working at the company where I did my internship, <a href=\"http://aimproductions.be/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AIM Productions</a>. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/EN/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands and I graduated in 2012. At the moment I work as a research assistant at the <a href=\"http://www.itu.dk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IT University of Copenhagen</a>, at <a href=\"http://itu.dk/pit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the PIT lab</a> working on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Human-Computer Interaction</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I mainly develop in C#, but occasionally do C++, PHP, Flash/actionscript 3 and Java projects. I care a lot about proper code design, and some people tend to say I overdo it.</p>\n", "Age":"28", "Location":"Belgium", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"128", "DisplayName":"Steven Jeuris", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-20T13:28:46.627"}
