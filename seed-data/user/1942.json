Shamelessly.</p>\n\n<p>This site looks like a great tool to observe commonly accepted idiomatic expressions in this ever-changing bastard child of a language.  I speak a pretty common middle American English with some influences from the South, and I am also fluent in Continental and Québécois French.  </p>\n\n<p>Foreign languages and linguistics are my passion (B.A. McGill 2008), and I have a heavy background in Latin (caveat emptor) as well as working competencies in Italian, Spanish, and German.</p>\n\n<p>While teaching is my vocation, I'm taking a break from it now to work on my Master's, and I work full time as a phone monkey for [international corporation] in a call center.        This delightful job gives me a great sampling of language usages, and I am eager to share and learn.</p>\n\n<p>I also enjoy long walks on the beach and foreign films.</p>\n", "Age":"31", "Location":"Briar Patch, VA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"livresque", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-08T18:44:22.060"}
