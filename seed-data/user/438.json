I work in (morpho)syntax, and dabble in semantics and psycholinguistics. My research interests are in the structure and interpretation of the noun phrase from a crosslinguistic perspective, the structure of Bengali and Indo-Aryan, the representation of argument and event structure, and constraints on variation in grammar and parsing.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of Linguistics I'm interested in religion and atheism, issues related to social justice (particularly for religious and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities), new(-ish) media (internet culture, comic books, video games, various electronics), and various aspects of nerd culture. I have a cat.</p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Adelphi, MD", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"509", "DisplayName":"dustinalfonso", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-10T14:38:09.880"}
