I discovered Computational Linguistics while receiving my B.A.Sc in Software Engineering when I built a basic bigram parser for an AI assignment. This caused me to become interested in linguistics and to take a few introductory level courses. I currently have completed my first year of my masters and am currently looking for a thesis topic.</p>\n"}
