Besides, this one didn't exist in the internet yet. <strong>:D</strong></p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the Stack Exchange Network has a lot of information, as Wikipedia does; but unlike Wikipedia, has a more low-context culture, which I dislike (although Portugal's culture is sadly heading that way - thank social networks). </p>\n\n<p>I use the Arch (Linux) distribution of GNU/Linux, as <a href=\"http://www.vanwensveen.nl/rants/microsoft/IhateMS.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows sucks</a> and I hate Apple and their products (that yet somehow (!) are extremely expensive) made by underpaid starving Chinese children.</p>\n\n<p>You can contact me through jmcf|25@hotmail.com or jmcf|25@gmail.com (NOTE: the \"|\" represents a \"1\", this just avoids some spam).</p>\n", "Age":"16", "Location":"Funchal, Portugal", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"166", "DisplayName":"JMCF125", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-30T15:58:00.133"}
