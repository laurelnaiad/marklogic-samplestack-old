I also have a bad tendency to use German grammar in my English writing...which actually works pretty well for me.</p>\n\n<p>It's not my fault I was only formally exposed to grammar when I started learning German.</p>\n\n<p>Calculus is totally sexy, and I would probably marry Gottfried Leibnitz if he were still alive. And just to cement my awesome dorkiness to the world: I decided I wanted to study linguistics after I read The Lord of the Rings and found out Tolkien was a philologist. That was the only reason I ever went on a language kick. Before that I was an art/history nerd, with emphasis on the art. Who knows why?</p>\n\n<p>Fate is inexorable.</p>\n", "Age":"22", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"kitukwfyer", "LastAccessDate":"2012-05-31T17:02:12.250"}
