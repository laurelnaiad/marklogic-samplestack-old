You name it, I've probably bashed against it - or at least ran away screaming: \"<em>Dot Net is Coming ! Dot Net is Coming !</em>\" </p>\n\n<p>I do some technical writing, editing, and translate German to English. I also do design work in electronics, art, and (building) architecture.\n<br /><br />\n - <strong>Architecture:</strong> project and topology planning, systems assessments. <br />\n - <strong>Server-side:</strong> web services, middleware, systems integration.  <br />\n - <strong>Client-side:</strong>\nMobile, web, and desktop client GUIs, middle-to-top tier integration. \n<br /><br />\nKnow > 30 programming languages: 10 pretty good, 5 as expert.  Favorites: Python, C/C++, Java, Objective-C [ yes, I really do like it ], ASP (the good old, not.net kind), PHP, Bash, and the sweetest little language since Ruby and just before Boo: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">IO</a>.  { Sorry, Bill, but I don't like <em>Anything</em>.Net  ( Well, OK, I'll do C# if you pay me <em>really</em> well :) }</p>\n\n<p>Favorite IDE's / Editors: Eclipse, UltraEdit, and really a cool one: Sublime. Recently started using Android Studio (JetBrains) - very nice! \n<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pet</strong> Projects: Anything mathematical or astronomical, Ham Radio, CUDA coding, and learning Python Mods for Apache. Anything philosophical - including discovering the true nature of those mysterious beings we call <strong>cats.</strong><br />  </p>\n\n<p>... <strong>always open for contract work</strong> ...</p>\n\n<p>thanks for checking in on me !</p>\n\n<p>And, yes, the <strong><em>BitBucket</em></strong> really is in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>\n"}
