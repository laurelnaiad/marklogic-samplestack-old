Ran D&amp;D 3rd edition, D&amp;D 4th edition briefly, then became a fan of indie games. Particularly fond of GMless and short-form games because they fit nicely into a busy schedule, and are very good for enticing non-gamers into the roleplaying hobby. Currently rediscovering a love of early D&amp;D editions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/sevensideddie\" rel=\"nofollow\">@sevensideddie</a> on Twitter</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://d7.pipemaze.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Seven-Sided Die</a> blog</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Running</strong> nothing •\n<strong>Playing</strong> nothing •\n<strong>Scheming</strong> <a href=\"http://www.burningwheel.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burning Wheel Gold</a> •\n<strong>Reading</strong> <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0465036961\" rel=\"nofollow\">Killing Monsters: Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence</a></em></p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"SevenSidedDie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-11T22:11:59.513"}
