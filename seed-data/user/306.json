I figure if all goes well, I'll be teaching Intro to Linguistics once a year for the rest of my life, and I may as well get good at it.</p>\n", "Age":"33", "Location":"Austin, TX", "DownVotes":"7", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"2968", "DisplayName":"Dan Velleman", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-24T15:27:53.380"}
