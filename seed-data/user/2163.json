I almost know one language, that's English, my mother tongue. I have a constructed language I've been working on with friends for a couple years now, we have it going pretty well. I was homeschooled, that's how I've had time to construct a language. I'm an amateur to linguistics though.</p>\n", "Age":"19", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"22", "DisplayName":"Kotoka", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-17T01:47:20.843"}
