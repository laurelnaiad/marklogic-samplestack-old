Yes, there is a God, and no it is not his fault. God made the earth very good, and then gave us dominion over it. We handed it over to the devil when we disobeyed God, and things began to go down hill. Nevertheless, God immediately promised that a man would be born who would take away the sins of the world. That man was Jesus Christ, God's son. He came to earth, lived a perfect life, and then allowed himself to be executed as a criminal. In doing so, he paid the penalty for sin, which is death, for those who believe in him. Three days after he was killed, he rose from the dead, enslaving death! Then he went back to heaven. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Age":"20"}
