### Filter QnA Documents [filter-qna-documents]

People can People who arrive at the application should see the most ideal content upon entry.

Anyone who launches the application and does not provide search criteria nor specify sort order will be presented with a q-n-a documents page where all facets are at their default and no text search criteria or sort order are specified.

As such, the landing page will normally display all documents that they are allowed to see, sorted by descending document score.

**In general, this means that, by default, people see the highest scoring documents in the database.**

See the [List Documents] feature [list-documents] for more information.

#### Feature Specification: [landing-page.feature](./landing-page.feature)

*TODO: The narrative indicates that the default sort should be by relevance, but relevance is not applicable without a textual search, and as such the requirements should be modified.*
