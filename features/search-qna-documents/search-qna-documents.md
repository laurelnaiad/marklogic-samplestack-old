To refine a *qna documents list](../list-qna-dolist-qna-documents.md)*, anyone can specify *search criteria* to be applied to the list.

The set of documents searched will be those that would be returned based on the *filter criteria*. That is, the results are the combination of applying the *filter criteria* and the *search criteria* to the set of documents that the person can see based on their *role* and the *document permissions*.

The default *order* for the *search results* is by descending *relevance*. *Relevance* is calculated by the application based on the degree of matching between the *search criteria* and other weighted *factors*. Weighted factors are:

- *one*
- *two*
- *three*

The results of a search are presented with the following attributes:

- *a*
- *b*
- *c*

See the **[List QnA Documents](../list-qna-documents/list-qna-documents.md)** feature for specification of the behavior of the *seach results*.
