  name: "Farewell to the Old Guard (Napol√©on Bonaparte)",
  point: "Soldiers of **my** Old Guard:\n\nI bid you farewell. For twenty years I have constantly accmpanied you on the road to honor and glory. In these latter times, as in the days of our prosperity, you have invariably been models of courage and fidelity. With men such as you our cause could not be lost; but the war would have been interminable; it would have been civil war, and that would have entailed deeper misfortunes on France. \n\nI have sacrificed all of **my** interests to those of the country. \n\nI go, but you, **my** friends, will continue to serve France. Her happiness was **my** only thought. It will still be the object of **my** wishes. Do not regret **my** fate; if I have consented to survive, it is to serve your glory. I intend to write the history of the great achievements we have performed together. Adieu, **my** friends. Would I could press you all to **my** heart.\n",
