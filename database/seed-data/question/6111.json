{"Body":"<p>A couple of years ago I encountered the world δυσμενής, meaning hostile, in an ancient Greek text I translated. If I recall correctly, this can be pronounced as \"dusmenè\". This always intrigued me, because being a speaker of Dari (which is a dialect of Farsi), I recognized the word, as in the Persian language <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%86#Persian\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"دشمن\"</a> (pronounced \"düşman\") means enemy. Coincidentally I know that in Punjabi you have the word \"ਦੁਸ਼ਮਣ\" (\"duśamaṇa\"), which means foe. </p>\n\n<p>So I have already noticed that a lot of Punjabi words are borrowed from Persian, through my own experience with the language while travelling Punjab. However I am not familiar with other cases of Persian borrowing Greek words, especially a word as common as \"enemy\". Historically, there is a link between the regions, as Alexander the Great conquered Persia, and the (Hellenistic) Seleucid empire kept it under control for over a century.  </p>\n\n<p>So is there any reason to believe this word is borrowed from Greek? Or is there another, more reasonable alternative (such as Arabic perhaps)?</p>\n", "Id":"6111", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6112", "Title":"Is دشمن (\"enemy\" in Persian) borrowed from δυσμενής (\"hostile\" in ancient Greek)?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-11T17:38:09.407", "OwnerUserId":"2855", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><borrowing><greek><persian>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-12T08:06:30.560", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"117", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-14T08:36:13.367", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/edb8dfdcab6266c6acad8a4292231128?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2855", "AccountId":"2319472", "CreationDate":"2013-12-11T17:14:03.200", "AboutMe":"<p>Interested in languages, and by extension linguistics. </p>\n", "Age":"18", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"143", "DisplayName":"OmnipresentAbsence", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-26T23:44:27.737"}}
