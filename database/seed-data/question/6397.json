{"Body":"<p>Many ancient languages have a structure more complex than the \"respective\" modern languages such that modern languages like English have a more simple structure, with no cases,genders or declinations, compared to ancient language spoken in the same area like Latin. Reading Latin texts I wonder if common Latin really communicate with such difficult constructions or everyday languages was simpler then written one.\nThe same is for ancient Greek and Sanskrit. So why the languages became simpler with the time? And the constructions we find in ancient written texts were usually used in spoken language and can describe the use of the languages by illiterates?</p>\n", "Id":"6397", "LastEditorUserId":"3024", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"Why many ancient languages are so complicated compared to many moderns one?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T15:19:16.953", "OwnerUserId":"3024", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-14T16:06:01.330", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29470b2fa544111600d417fb08b21d69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"3024", "AccountId":"2263702", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T15:01:48.083", "DisplayName":"G M", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T09:40:07.103"}, "ViewCount":"139", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-15T03:30:10.477", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29470b2fa544111600d417fb08b21d69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"3024", "AccountId":"2263702", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T15:01:48.083", "DisplayName":"G M", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T09:40:07.103"}}
