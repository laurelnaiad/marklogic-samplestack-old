{"Body":"<p>The Wikipedia entry on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents\" rel=\"nofollow\">rhotic and non-rhotic accents</a> gives a pretty good overview of which countries and states are rhotic or non-rhotic. What I want to know is what the pattern (or link) between the rhotic countries and states is, or even if such a link exists.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of any link, why is it distributed the way it is? What are the factors lying behind the development of the rhoticity?</p>\n", "Id":"3373", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "Title":"How is rhoticity distributed among varieties of English?
