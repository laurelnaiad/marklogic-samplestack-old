{"Body":"<p>I am a native Russian speaker.</p>\n\n<p>When I am listening to songs and music in other languages, which I do not know, such as Italian, Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, and even Japanese, Finnish, Kyrgyz and Hebrew, I usually can write what I hear with Russian letters (with possibly adding 1 to 3 additional characters for sounds not present in Russian). </p>\n\n<p>But that is not the case with English. When listening to English songs I can barely understand anything even though I can write and read in English well.
