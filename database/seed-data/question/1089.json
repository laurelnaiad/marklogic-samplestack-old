{"Body":"<p>I confess this question is rather theory-internal, but it may be very trivial for someone who follows the theoretical literature well. I am thinking of a type of constraint and want to know if such a thing has been proposed before, in the OT literature or elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a representation where X is a root node, and i and j are features of the same type (e.g. they are both tone features), and imagine further that i and j are both linked to X, so you have a representation like</p>\n\n<pre><code>  X\n /\\\ni j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If i and j are different, then there is a contour. Now what if i and j are the same? Has there been discussion on a constraint against, as it were, \"trivial contours?\" </p>\n\n<p>[subsequently added] Also, let's say that we want to ban the above representation, but still permit</p>\n\n<pre><code>X X\n| |\ni j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So a simple OCP rule will not suffice. Then further suppose that</p>\n\n<pre><code>  X\n /\\\ni j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when i and j are different, is also permitted.</p>\n\n<p>[a second addition] To narrow the problem further, let's say that three elements, <strong>i,i,j</strong> are to be linked to two nodes, X1 and X2. The two possibilities where every element is associated with some node, and every node is associated with some element are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X1  X2   X1 X2\n/\\  |     | /\\\ni i j     i i j\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both of these have one OCP violation, and one violation of NoContour, so these two constraints cannot be used in combination to solve the problem.</p>\n", "Id":"1089", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1103", "Title":"Constraint against multiple identical linkage in OT", "CreationDate":"2011-11-29T18:38:51.720", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<optimality-theory>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-30T03:06:44.037", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"100", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-01T21:02:37.727", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
