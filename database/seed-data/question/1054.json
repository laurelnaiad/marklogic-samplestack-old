{"Body":"<p>There seems to be some controversy about how an obviate proximate system works. I get that it doesn't work like a nominative-accusative or ergative-absolutive system. </p>\n\n<p>In some attempts to illustrate obviate-proximate systems, multiple sentences are used and the entity that gets the case ending keeps it for the entire discourse. So I think ah ha! So the system must rely on who is who because in one of those sentences is was made obvious by context or the like. <a href=\"http://clarionfoundation.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/spec-tech-wait-who-hit-who/\">This is one example of an illustration that relies on two sentence</a> (or actually one sentence joined with a conjunction)</p>\n\n<p>Then the next illustration uses only a single sentence (all the examples on wikipedia are like that). So then I think, well this must not be a discourse level phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>So how does an obviate proximate system work and what gets marked in a single sentence utterance?</p>\n", "Id":"1054", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1056", "Title":"How exactly does an obviate proximate system work?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-21T19:13:01.053", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<syntax>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"20", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"369", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-21T21:09:17.713", "Score":"9", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"72", "WebsiteUrl":"http://suburbandestiny.com/conlang", "Id":"20", "AccountId":"15651", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:53:42.550", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programmer by day and an amateur linguist by night.</p>\n\n<p>I organize the Arlington Linguistics Book Club, where we read a wide variety of books that make the science of linguistic accessible to a popular audience.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"6", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"1657", "DisplayName":"MatthewMartin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:46:09.130"}}
