{"Body":"<p>With regard to the English language, how many words is the average person likely to hear (not read) on an average day. By \"how many words\" I don't mean how many unique words. In other words if I hear the word \"get\" 1000 times and \"given\" 10 times, then this would result in 1010 being added to the total result. This means that I can multiply the total result for a day by seven in order to get an estimate for a week. </p>\n\n<p>I realise that class, occupation and number of friends etc. have an impact on this value, but I really only need a very rough estimate. What I'm interested in knowing is how many words a learner is exposed to on a given day when immersed in an English speaking society.</p>\n", "Id":"3364", "Title":"How many words do we hear in a day?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-12T06:10:06.120", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1835", "Tags":"<second-lang-acquisition>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"334", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-12T06:56:06.863", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}}
