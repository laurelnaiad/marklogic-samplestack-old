{"Body":"<p>From what I've heard, syllable-timed languages have syllables of equal length throughout each breath-group (i.e. bit of spoken discourse said in one breath), and stress-timed languages have breath-groups of equal length.   By this account, the former entails variation in the length of each breath-group and the latter entails variation in syllable length.   </p>\n\n<p>However, I could have botched these definitions.  Also, I've heard rumors that the timing scheme in a given language can change with rate of speech.  I've also heard a rumor that this distinction isn't quite valid.  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore I'm asking for a brief and authoritative statement about the difference between stress-timing and syllable timing, and whether this distinction is considered valid by linguists.  </p>\n", "Id":"2420", "LastEditorUserId":"2278", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3663", "Title":"What is the difference between syllable-timing and stress-timing?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-14T20:41:45.907", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><linguistic-typology><stress><syllable-timing><rhythm>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-29T14:20:56.110", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"848", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-29T14:20:56.110", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
