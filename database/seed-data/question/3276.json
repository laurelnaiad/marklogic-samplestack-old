{"OwnerDisplayName":"anon", "Body":"<p><a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/155/why-is-prescriptivism-criticized/208#208\">This question</a> concerns the reasons why prescriptivism is criticized. I know of these criticisms because I hold them myself. However, I have a question about the opposite side, and that is, do any professional linguists hold a strong prescriptive belief, and criticize descriptivism as heavily as the other side criticizes prescriptivism? If so, where can I find information about them?</p>\n", "Id":"3276", "Title":"Does anyone criticize descriptivism as heavily as prescriptivism?", "CreationDate":"2013-02-25T19:12:10.167", "AnswerCount":"2", "PostTypeId":"1", "LastEditorDisplayName":"anon", "Tags":"<descriptive-linguistics><prescriptivism>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-04T21:29:21.157", "ViewCount":"255", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-04T21:29:21.157", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"10"}
