{"Body":"<p>I am doing research on machine translation in prolog and I am wondering if there are any suitable dictionaries available in text/xml format for machine translation. With suitable for machine translation I mean that entries are marked with word category like noun, verb, etc and whether the word is male/female or singular/plural etc.</p>\n\n<p>I did some research myself and found some dictionaries like Wiktionary or Omegawiki but these are usually not complete or do not have the required information like word category etc. Specifically I am looking for dictionaries translating single words between English/German/French/Dutch.</p>\n\n<p>The many online translation websites are not suitable for my needs, I would need something that works offline. Are there any standard dictionaries that machine translation researchers use?</p>\n", "Id":"4403", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Dictionaries for machine translation", "CreationDate":"2013-09-08T20:46:08.450", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2449", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><dictionary><machine-translation>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"75", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-10T09:47:50.283", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2449", "AccountId":"3278403", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"11", "CreationDate":"2013-09-08T20:46:08.450", "DisplayName":"Mark", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-13T19:20:55.757"}}
