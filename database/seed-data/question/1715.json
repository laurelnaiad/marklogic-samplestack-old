{"Body":"<p>It may not even be accurate to call it \"slang\"...\nI am working on a filtering system that blocks pornography.\nI have a set of key words and phrases in English. Essentially, I would like to have the equivalent of these words and phrases in various languages.  I considered trying to use Google Translate but was unsure how accurate it would be on the wide range of slang naughty words and phrases I have.\nI thought about posting it as a job on Elance but I am unsure if someone on there will be able to do significantly better than I could using the right slang translator.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?  Ideas?  Web site links?</p>\n", "Id":"1715", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What is the best way to accurately translate slang?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-28T07:31:54.097", "OwnerUserId":"876", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<online-resources><translation><machine-translation><multilingualism><slang>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-01T13:27:27.103", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"177", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-01T13:27:27.103", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"876", "AccountId":"263425", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"11", "CreationDate":"2012-03-28T07:22:00.710", "DisplayName":"user548971", "LastAccessDate":"2012-03-29T01:30:37.293"}}
