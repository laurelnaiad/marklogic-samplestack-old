{"Body":"<p><strong>Affix hopping</strong> is a morphological operation by which an unattached affix in the <code>T</code> position is lowered onto a verb. This attachment is done by the \"Phonetic Form component\" (the posited component in the mind that transforms the inputs it receives from the syntactic component into phonetic spell-outs). For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The boy kicks the ball.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The underlying syntax tree for this sentence can be represented as:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jtyG8.png\" alt=\"The boy kicks the ball\"></p>\n\n<p>Here, the suffix <em>-s</em> (that indicates third person, singular, present tense) has been taken from its original position and then attached to the end of the verb, producing the form <em>kicks</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head movement</strong> is another operation, by which the head of a phrase is moved (in fact, copied) from its original position to another one. This is a syntactic operation. An example of head moving for a question in English:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Will you marry me?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which can be syntactically represented as:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CvkmE.png\" alt=\"Will you marry me?\"></p>\n\n<p>In this case, the auxiliary <em>will</em> has been moved from its original position to become attached to the null complementizer that marks a question.</p>\n\n<p>Both operations involve moving a head from one position to another. But affix hopping is assumed to occur at a different level (or different \"mind component\") than head movement. What is the fundamental difference that makes linguists classify these two apparently similar kinds of movements as two very distinct operations?</p>\n", "Id":"441", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"446", "Title":"Why are affix hopping and head movement considered as distinct operations?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T00:42:28.187", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-23T01:20:31.820", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
