Is it only the vocabulary that is a bit common, or does the grammar also have things in common?</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for the lexicon, grammar and word-endings mostly, a comparison between the languages.</p>\n", "Id":"1777", "LastEditorUserId":"910", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1779", "Title":"Aramaic compared to Spanish", "CreationDate":"2012-04-12T17:21:31.690", "OwnerUserId":"910", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-families><spanish>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-12T17:27:58.287", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"910", "AccountId":"1050511", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"123", "CreationDate":"2012-04-08T09:39:41.750", "DisplayName":"Friend of Kim", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-17T14:43:42.007"}, "ViewCount":"179", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-19T18:03:34.887", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"910", "AccountId":"1050511", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"123", "CreationDate":"2012-04-08T09:39:41.750", "DisplayName":"Friend of Kim", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-17T14:43:42.007"}}
