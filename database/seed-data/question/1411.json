{"Body":"<p>According to this answer to the question : <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/70/92\">Do some languages have articles besides the definite and indefinite articles?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is worth noting, I think, that \"article\" is not a theoretical\n  primitive in (most if not all) contemporary generative theories of\n  syntax.  A generative syntactician would say that languages have\n  larger or smaller inventories of determiners (e.g. <em>this</em>, <em>that</em>;\n  this is the category from which <em>the</em> developed) and quantifiers (e.g.\n  <em>one</em>, <em>many</em>, <em>no</em>; this is the category from which <em>a(n)</em> developed).  However, articles are a notion of classical grammar and\n  are definitionally restricted to the definite and indefinite.  </p>\n  \n  <p>(Some grammarians might include more kinds of articles, as <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Article_%28grammar%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">the\n  Wikipedia article on articles</a> does.  But this reflects more a\n  taxonomic whim of the analyst than a fact about language.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to me that it is more meaningful to say that <em>the</em> is a special kind of determiners and <em>a/an</em> is a special kind of quantifiers. How can we explain, then, that grammarians classify them together? Is the reason linguistic or is it just a convenience to make it easier to learn grammar? Or because it just \"makes sense\"? And also, why is the partitive classified in the same group?</p>\n", "Id":"1411", "LastEditorUserId":"119", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1414", "Title":"Why is the definite, indefinite, and partitive article grouped together?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-13T16:53:06.277", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><articles><generative-grammar>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-20T13:40:16.573", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"282", "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-20T13:40:16.573", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
