{"Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_and_parameters\" rel=\"nofollow\">principles and parameters paradigm</a> says that most languages in the world have their individual structure (grammatical meta-rules) set (and easily learnable) by a small set of principles and parameters. For example, English is (mostly) right-branching (modifiers come -after/o the right) of the modified head) and non-pro-drop (it must have pronouns with the verb). </p>\n\n<p>Is there a reference list somewhere of which languages have what value of the parameters? <a href=\"http://wals.info/feature\" rel=\"nofollow\">WALS</a> has an unbelievably long list of features, but frankly none of them correspond to the more abstract theorized parameters.</p>\n\n<p>Also, implicit in this question is what are the currently accepted parameters. The wikipedia article has a list of including head and pro-drop, but there seems to be lot of overlap among those given, showing that that list may not be totally coherent (or equally may be a reflection of the lack of coherence of the research so far).</p>\n", "Id":"537", "LastEditorUserId":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"564", "Title":"Is there a reference for the parameters of the world's languages?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T18:10:01.223", "OwnerUserId":"4", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><comparative-linguistics><principles-and-parameters>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-26T20:31:37.917", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"432", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"United States", "Id":"4", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"167219", "Views":"42", "Reputation":"1906", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:24:01.087", "DisplayName":"Mitch", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T11:56:51.610", "AboutMe":"<p>Native speaker of American English (AmE) with touches of Southern AmE.\nProficient in French and German.
