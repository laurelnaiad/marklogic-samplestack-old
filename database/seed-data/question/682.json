{"Body":"<p>By following the comments to <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/663/do-the-khoisan-languages-resemble-the-first-world-language\">another question about the evolution of Khoisan languages</a>, I learned that there is a heated debate in Evolutionary Linguistics about the origin of language. Some quick research on Wikipedia shows that there are two major, competing hypotheses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <strong>monogenesis hypothesis</strong>, which holds that there was a single proto-language, estimated to have originated between 200,000 and 50,000 years ago.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong>polygenesis hypothesis</strong>, according to which languages evolved as several lineages independent of one another.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What is the current state of this debate? What are the most recent (and compelling) pieces of evidence in favor of each side?</p>\n", "Id":"682", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"684", "Title":"Monogenesis vs. Polygenesis", "CreationDate":"2011-10-03T23:47:01.717", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<evolutionary-linguistics><origin-of-language>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-04T08:35:21.540", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"2509", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-15T19:30:10.877", "Score":"11", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
