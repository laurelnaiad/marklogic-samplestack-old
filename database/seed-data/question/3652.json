{"Body":"<p>It seems like Indo-European languages are always stuck between throwing away complicated fusional grammar (like English) or retaining most of it (like Russian). Are there any Indo-European languages that reanalyzed the verb system into agglutination with series of suffixes rather than trying to stuff complex tense, aspect, and person information into a single arbitrarily chosen suffix?</p>\n\n<p>Or is it generally a rule that languages evolve away from agglutination and never towards it? It seems, for example, that Modern Japanese is a bit more fusional rather than agglutinative due to certain sound changes - for example in Classical Japanese \"ikitari\" <em>went</em> simplifying into \"ikita\" (which prevented further addition of affixes since -ta is not a verb citation form ending) and then fused into \"itta\", which obscures the root \"ik\", thus becoming somewhat fusional.</p>\n", "Id":"3652", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3822", "Title":"Is there any agglutinative Indo-European language?", "CreationDate":"2013-05-06T23:35:41.933", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<indo-european><agglutination>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2028", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"259", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-16T16:06:26.790", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"27", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/y49By.png", "Id":"2028", "AccountId":"2107308", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"102", "CreationDate":"2013-05-06T22:04:41.097", "DisplayName":"user54609", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T13:32:50.887", "AboutMe":"<p>Katie in raining icebergs save unknown ricocheting Finns, master Immelmann ran an instinct dotca, kiss rat sap four.</p>\n"}}
