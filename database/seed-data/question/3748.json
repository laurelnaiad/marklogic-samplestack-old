{"Body":"<p>Where can I find a database of English words that has the various forms for each word? Specifically, it would give the plural and singular form with its indefinite article for each noun, the various forms, tenses, and voices for verbs, and the comparative and superlative for adjectives. It would be easy to use it to solve queries like (noun,plural,\"fish\") and (verb,past,\"to go\").</p>\n", "Id":"3748", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3760", "Title":"Existing English word database with word forms?", "CreationDate":"2013-05-22T05:07:27.177", "OwnerUserId":"2090", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><reference-request>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-23T11:18:06.263", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
