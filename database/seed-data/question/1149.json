{"Body":"<p>In <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/1147/51\">Mitch's answer to <strong><em>\"What is the difference between a diphthong and a glide?\"</em></strong></a> and its comments it seems more than one of us is at least a bit confused as to how many <strong><em>phonemes</em></strong> a single <strong><em>diphthong</em></strong> represents:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The two vowel sounds in a diphthong combine to make a single phoneme.</li>\n<li>A diphthong is a sequence of two phonemes of a certain kind in a certain relationship.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the two sounds of a diphthong are considered to be one phoneme, but sometimes they are each considered separate phonemes, depending on context or something else.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So which of these possibilities is true? And if <strong>3.</strong> is true, what are the things that make it one or two phonemes?</p>\n", "Id":"1149", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Is a diphthong one phoneme or two, or does it depend?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-14T13:59:58.663", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"51", "Tags":"<phonetics><phonology><terminology><phonemes><diphthongs>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"1619", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-16T01:02:32.343", "Score":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
