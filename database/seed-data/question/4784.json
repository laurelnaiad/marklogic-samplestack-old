{"Body":"<ol>\n<li>Sue considers Joe <strong>a fool</strong>.</li>\n<li>Sue calls Joe \"<strong>Daddy-O</strong>\".</li>\n<li>Joe weighs <strong>200 pounds</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It seems that none of these are objects, as witnessed by the fact that you can't raise them to be the subject of a passive clause: *A fool is considered Joe by Sue, *\"Daddy-O\" is called Joe by Sue, *200 pounds is/are weighed by Joe. What are their syntactic and semantic roles?</p>\n\n<p>I realize that 3 is a completely different kettle of fish than 1-2. My attempt at an answer for 1: it's a predicate in a verbless subordinate clause, cf. \"Sue considers Joe to be a fool\", with the same meaning and an explicit verb. (This procedure of analyzing the structure of a sentence S by means of a paraphrase S' isn't obviously valid to me, by the way, but I realize it's normal in syntax.) 2 looks similar enough that something along the same lines might work, but here you can't make the subordinate verb explicit (*Sue calls Joe to be \"Daddy-O\").</p>\n\n<p>3 is obviously something else entirely. \"200 pounds\" is a required argument of the verb (*Joe weighs), but syntactically not an object (apparently) and semantically not a patient or theme, so what is it?</p>\n", "Id":"4784", "Title":"What are these NPs, syntactically and semantically?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-24T17:50:01.297", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "Tags":"<syntax><semantics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-29T22:39:27.257", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
