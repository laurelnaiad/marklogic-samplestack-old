{"Body":"<p>We have had a number of questions about <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sound-change\">sound changes</a>, asking for the history of specific changes. See this one, for example: asking about the change <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/2604/22\">from Latin <em>benedictionem</em> to French <em>beneiçon</em></a>. Often, as the original poster of that question observed, the process can be explained by a series of steps of just one sound correspondence. As far as I know, each sound change is only productive for a certain period of time in a language. Of course, different changes may be occurring simultaneously, so overlaps of these periods are expected.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for something more general: a diagram &mdash; probably a tree-shaped one &mdash; that shows the development from Latin into the Romance languages. The diagram must meet the following requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shows at least two of the major six Romance languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian and Catalan.</li>\n<li>Each branch shows the history of the language from Vulgar Latin to the present day.</li>\n<li>Each branch has the sound changes and their respective (approximate) periods annotated.</li>\n<li>For each language, any variety can be chosen, as long as it remains the same throughout the diagram.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there some book, site, whatever, where one can find such a diagram?</p>\n", "Id":"3385", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"Is there a diagram showing the history of sound changes from Latin to the Romance languages?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-15T16:32:33.353", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><reference-request><sound-change><romance-languages>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-16T23:13:14.067", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
