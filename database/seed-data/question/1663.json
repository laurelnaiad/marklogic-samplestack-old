{"Body":"<p>In an effort to clearly delineate <strong>durar</strong> and <strong>tardar</strong> to my Spanish students, I have been searching for some usage notes and I was not satisfied with anything I found. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, I was wondering if these two words represent two aspects of the same idea, somewhat similar to how Russian and Slavic languages have different words for different aspects; like how the <strong>писа-</strong> stem is imperfective, and the <strong>написа-</strong> stem is used for the perfective aspect and both mean <strong>to write</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to test my hypothesis by doing a simple word-frequency chart and I compared the following two words to each other in thousands of books in Spanish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>tardaron</strong> to <strong>duraron</strong> (preterite)</li>\n  <li><strong>tardaban</strong> to <strong>duraban</strong> (imperfect)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I chose the third person plural, because the verb tenses are unique. Whereas several other verb forms are not, such as the first and third person in imperfect; <strong>tardaba</strong> means both <strong>I took</strong> and <strong>He took</strong>. I skipped second person tenses because they seem dubious to search for in writing.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ROFAc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>From the experiment it appears that Spanish writers prefer <strong>tardaron</strong> to <strong>duraron</strong> (preterite) about 2:1, and <strong>duraban</strong> to <strong>tardaban</strong> (imperfect) about 2:1, which is the complete opposite.</p>\n\n<p>It seems like it makes sense, the nature of the word <strong>durar</strong> focuses on the duration of the action, whereas <strong>tardar</strong> focuses on the outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Is this because Spanish speakers subconsciously prefer <strong>tardar</strong> for the preterite/perfect aspect, and <strong>durar</strong> for the imperfect aspect? Are there any words that would presumably follow this order?</p>\n", "Id":"1663", "LastEditorUserId":"740", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1694", "Title":"Do Spanish speakers prefer certain words for certain aspects, like in Russian?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-18T06:34:35.910", "OwnerUserId":"740", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<verbs><spanish><aspect><russian>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-18T06:53:40.020", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"740", "AccountId":"367785", "CreationDate":"2012-02-05T20:21:08.563", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"29", "Location":"Los Angeles, CA", "DownVotes":"13", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"291", "DisplayName":"Cayetano Gonçalves", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T02:41:09.117"}, "ViewCount":"289", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-09T17:55:15.247", "Score":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"25", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"740", "AccountId":"367785", "CreationDate":"2012-02-05T20:21:08.563", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"29", "Location":"Los Angeles, CA", "DownVotes":"13", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"291", "DisplayName":"Cayetano Gonçalves", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T02:41:09.117"}}
