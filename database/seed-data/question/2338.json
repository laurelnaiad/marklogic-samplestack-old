{"Body":"<p>I need an English parser written in Java with a small memory/processing input. I have used the Stanford parser, but it is rather heavy. I am also considering using the <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/linkgrammar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">link grammar</a> parser, which is fast and small, but would require me to write several more grammar rules for my domain. The goal is to extract a semantic structure from an utterance, so anything that can lead easily to that would be nice. Can anyone suggest something good to use?</p>\n", "Id":"2338", "LastEditorUserId":"41", "Title":"Small English parser written in Java", "CreationDate":"2012-08-02T21:11:54.463", "OwnerUserId":"41", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><english><parsing>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-03T13:50:16.877", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"207", "Location":"Sacramento, CA", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"41", "AccountId":"218482", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"269", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:03:47.793", "DisplayName":"Nate Glenn", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-08T17:24:08.140", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm studying computational linguistics at Brigham Young University.
