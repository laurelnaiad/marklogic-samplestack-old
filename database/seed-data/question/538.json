{"Body":"<p>It's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European\" rel=\"nofollow\">fact</a> that the grammar core of most European languages (not only IE ones) can be analysed in a relatively precise common framework. Of course I do not know much of these languages, but the basic concepts of nouns, verbs, adjectives, verb tenses, pronouns etc. seem to be relevant not only for Indo-European languages, but also for some of their neighbours (Finno-Ugric, Turkish, Semitic, Dravidian...) A perusal of a Finnish Grammar book, for example, will give to the IE reader an occasional surprise (vowel harmony, say), but won't transport him to another planet.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not interested in a list of linguistic curiosities, but in cases where a serious grammatical analysis has been made that required a brand new look on the language. For example, a language grammar lacking a verb vs. noun contrast would certainly qualify.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lojban</a> grammar perfectly illustrates the kind of exotic I'm after, I'm only interested in natural examples.</p>\n\n<p>This is something like the whimsical companion of a more precise question <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/536/verbs-vs-nouns-in-polynesian-languages\">I asked earlier.</a></p>\n", "Id":"538", "LastEditorUserId":"76", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"Are there grammatical analyses of languages that are extremely different from IE grammar?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T18:30:12.743", "OwnerUserId":"189", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<linguistic-universals><comparative-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"8", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-04T21:44:14.537", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"35", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/alekstorm", "Id":"76", "AccountId":"411223", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:34:32.303", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Urbana, IL", "DownVotes":"17", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1043", "DisplayName":"Alek Storm", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T07:20:27.393"}, "ViewCount":"498", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-27T18:38:44.317", "Score":"16", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"30", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"189", "AccountId":"924492", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"295", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T19:36:05.183", "DisplayName":"JPP", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-14T01:20:48.150", "AboutMe":"<p>My first language is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">some dialect of Latin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My last language is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCbatulabal_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tübatulabal</a> (<em>ex æquo</em>).</p>\n", "Age":"37"}}
