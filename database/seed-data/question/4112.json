{"Body":"<p>What do the terms \"exponent\" and \"formative\" mean in linguistics?</p>\n\n<p>I've seen the term \"exponent\" used in linguistics texts, and found a definition at Wikipedia.   \"An exponent is a phonological manifestation of a morphosyntactic property. In non-technical language, it is the expression of one or more grammatical properties by sound.\"   </p>\n\n<p>The article goes on to give examples of the different types of exponents:   </p>\n\n<p>\"Identity (e.g. deer + PLURAL = deer)<br>\nAffixation (e.g. look + PAST = looked)<br>\nInternal Modification (e.g. sing + past = sang)<br>\nReduplication (e.g. toó ‘man’ totóo ‘people’ (from Pangasinin, cited in WALS)\" </p>\n\n<p>But the article cites no references or sources, I have been unable to find authoritative references and sources elsewhere, and I have been unable to find a definition of linguistic \"formatives\" and how they are related to linguistic exponents.</p>\n", "Id":"4112", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4114", "Title":"What do the terms \"exponent\" and \"formative\" mean in linguistics?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-05T04:48:14.873", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<terminology><morphology>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"790", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"163", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-17T21:30:37.647", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
