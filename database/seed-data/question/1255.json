{"Body":"<p>A friend was asking me why there aren't any programs that can analyze a user's pronunciation of words and then give feedback/suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, given an accurate phonetic transcription of a predetermined set of words, determining if a user's pronunciation of each word is standard/correct — or, say, determining someone's regional accent — should be trivial.</p>\n\n<p>However, my sense was that Automatic Phonetic Transcription (APT) is not nearly accurate enough to analyze a user's pronunciation in that way — though my knowledge is about 10 years out of date.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it made me wonder: even if APT of <em>spontaneous</em> speech does have a low accuracy — in a context where each expected word (and even possible alternate pronunciations) is known ahead of time, would accuracy conceivably high enough to give a user feedback on pronunciation?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: arjan pointed out that Rosetta Stone claims to be able to give pronunciation feedback; how does such a system work (and how well)?</p>\n", "Id":"1255", "LastEditorUserId":"661", "FavoriteCount":"3", "Title":"Automatic phonetic transcription of speech: is it still a difficult problem?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T22:24:53.527", "OwnerUserId":"661", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<nlp><transcription>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-11T15:37:55.653", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"661", "AccountId":"1162592", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"56", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T21:24:53.187", "DisplayName":"Animadvert", "LastAccessDate":"2012-01-14T18:32:33.510", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"340", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-04T16:32:39.953", "Score":"11", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"661", "AccountId":"1162592", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"56", "CreationDate":"2012-01-10T21:24:53.187", "DisplayName":"Animadvert", "LastAccessDate":"2012-01-14T18:32:33.510", "AboutMe":""}}
