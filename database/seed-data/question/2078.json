{"Body":"<p>I'm asking this because I'm learning Swahili now, for which the word 'yes' translates to 'ndiyo' and 'no' translates to 'hakuna.'  It strikes me as strange that a language would have such long words to convey such important concepts as 'yes' and 'no.'  </p>\n\n<p>Two questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are there any other languages that have longer words than Swahili for yes and no (or any  basic modifiers or conjunctions)?</li>\n<li>What is the reason that such long words stayed in the language, rather than evolving into an abridged version of the word?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:\nThe intention of my post was to see if other languages had long words for \"yes\" and \"no\" when directly translated.  I'm not concerned about other ways to communicate 'yes' and 'no' (like 'affirmative' or 'negative') because those aren't the default responses to questions in the language under consideration.  The follow-up question was why these languages have such large words for default responses (yes or no) when it would seem like the words should evolve over time to be more efficient (shorter amount of time to say, write, etc.)</p>\n", "Id":"2078", "LastEditorUserId":"796", "Title":"What language has the longest word for 'no' and 'yes'?", "CreationDate":"2012-06-08T16:32:09.580", "OwnerUserId":"796", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic><language-change><psycholinguistics>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-11T00:53:15.340", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"796", "AccountId":"155700", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"133", "CreationDate":"2012-02-27T03:43:00.040", "DisplayName":"Parseltongue", "LastAccessDate":"2012-08-04T04:45:25.597", "AboutMe":"<p>Amateur programmer studying at Harvard; primarily program in Python, but know C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, and Basic.
