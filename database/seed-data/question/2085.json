{"Body":"<p>The chart below shows a chain of sound changes that happened to the English language, from 1400 onwards. Although the chart was intended to describe the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Vowel Shift</a>, it is not accurate<sup>*</sup>, since it describes not only the GVS, but also other changes, that happened later, and also affected the English vowels, such as [oʊ̯] > [əʊ̯]. </p>\n\n<p>As I understand, only the changes that affected the <em>long vowels</em> are considered part of the GVS.
