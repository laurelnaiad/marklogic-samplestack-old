{"Body":"<p>For those who came in late:    From what I understand, English stative verbs don't take the progressive.   We can use progressive in utterances with dynamic verbs.   Witness \"I'm eating,\" \"She's running,\" and \"The Martians are melting the tanks.\"   But we can't use progressive in utterances with stative verbs.   Witness these:  \"*I'm believing in Santa,\" \"*She's knowing the way home,\" or \"*The Martians are owning California.\"   </p>\n\n<p>We know that the verb \"think\" isn't always stative.  So we have these perfectly well-formed English messages with \"think\" in the progressive.   \"Don't disturb her;  she's thinking.\"   \"You aren't thinking about leaving, are you?\"  \"You've been thinking bad thoughts!\"   </p>\n\n<p>But it seemed to me, until recently, that \"think\" was always stative when it took a that- clause as a complement.   \"I think that we should end this card game,\" was and is grammatical, but four decades ago when I was young, \"*I'm thinking that we should end this card game\" was not.    </p>\n\n<p>This seems to have changed.  Now I hear (or rather \"now I'm hearing\") \"think\" with both progressive and that-clause complements all the time.   </p>\n\n<p>Are we witnessing the death of stative \"think\"?   If not, am I missing out on a fact about the usage of \"think\" and verbs like it that's been around for a long time?</p>\n", "Id":"3474", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3479", "Title":"Are we witnessing the death of stative \"think\"?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-31T18:24:16.017", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><verbs><lexicon>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-07T09:27:07.087", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"147", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-07T09:27:07.087", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
