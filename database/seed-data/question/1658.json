{"Body":"<p>I am not sure if the post really is about tag questions. I apologize for the confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider the following situation in English.

In Chinese, however, people would say <strong>\"yes\"</strong>, since they agree with the friend that they haven't had lunch.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am wondering whether this difference is prevalent and where it came from. Also, since it is not a tag question, what is the right term here?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>EDIT</h2>\n\n<p>I came across \"rhetorical question\" and \"negative question\" on Wikipedia as well but was not sure what exactly those two terms meant.
