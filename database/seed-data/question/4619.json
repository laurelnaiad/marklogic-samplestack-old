{"Body":"<p>I know a bit about parsing computer languages. Generally they try to resolve all ambiguities when parsing or abort the parse and throw an error.</p>\n\n<p>This means you either got nothing because there was an error, or you have a neat syntax tree / AST with no ambiguities.</p>\n\n<p>Of course in natural languages ambiguity is rampant and has to be handled somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Since the same kind of syntax tree used for computer languages could not work for natural languages (\"can\" in an ambiguous sentence might be part of a verb phrase or part of a noun phrase depending how you look at it) <strong>I'm wondering if there is some data structure which has gained wide acceptance among NLP practitioners.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A simplistic obvious approach is just to have one tree for each way of parsing a sentence, but the longer the sentence and the more ambiguities, they tend to compound and everything quickly gets out of hand.</p>\n\n<p>I'm expecting there is some kind of multidimensional tree used which is \"flat\" in the unambiguous parts of a sentence but has extra layers for each variant parse just in the ambiguous sections. Or am I barking up the wrong tree?</p>\n", "Id":"4619", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4620", "Title":"Is there a favoured data structure for storing ambiguous parse trees in Natural Language Processing?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-05T08:06:39.583", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<nlp><parsing><ambiguity>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-05T09:14:20.250", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"161", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-12T06:59:25.293", "Score":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
