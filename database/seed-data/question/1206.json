{"Body":"<p>Sometimes, I read passages like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Languages X, Y and Z in region A are closely related to each other, comparable to French, Italian and Spanish in Western Europe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The discussion in the question <em>\"<a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1199/do-distantly-related-languages-have-a-lower-incidence-of-false-friends\">Do distantly related languages have a lower incidence of false friends?</a>\"</em> also implies that languages can be considered \"closely related\" or \"distantly related\" to each other.</p>\n\n<p>How would one measure such distance and do linguists make that measurement for any purpose? Sometimes it's logically obvious, as a commenter in the linked question point out, that \"it is uncontroversial to say that, given German as a reference point, Flemish (both West Germanic languages) is closer than Danish (both Germanic languages), which in turn is closer than Italian (both Indo-European)\". How about comparison across different families? For example, How would one determine if Mandarin and Cantonese are (relatively) more closely related to each other than French and Spanish?</p>\n", "Id":"1206", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1207", "Title":"Do linguists measure the relation distance between languages?
