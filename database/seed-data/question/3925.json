{"Body":"<p>I'm trying to analyse the verb brought (or bring) in terms of lexical aspect, or aktionsart. More accurately, it's an analysis of the Hungarian verb \"hozta\" (bring-3sg.pst.def). </p>\n\n<p>Would it be telic (and therefore an accomplishment), as it clearly has a definite object (the thing being brought); and I assume that to 'bring' something, there is an end point to which you will stop bringing it and instead be depositing/gifting/offering/leaving it at the place?\nMy intuition says that the <strong>bringing to x</strong> goal is contextual and implied; not inherent in the semantics of the verb; and therefore atelic and an <strong>activity</strong>. But then my intuition tends to be a bit wishy-washy, and I'm apt to change my mind. </p>\n\n<p>What are people's thoughts?</p>\n", "Id":"3925", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Aktionsart - \"brought\"", "CreationDate":"2013-06-27T06:22:06.737", "OwnerUserId":"2197", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<semantics><verbs><lexical-semantics><aktionsart><hungarian>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-28T06:02:30.983", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"129", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-13T14:48:25.890", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2197", "AccountId":"1463099", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"19", "CreationDate":"2013-06-27T06:15:39.993", "DisplayName":"user1376829", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-27T07:34:59.967"}}
