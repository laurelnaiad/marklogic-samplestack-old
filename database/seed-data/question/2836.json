{"Body":"<p>At <a href=\"http://travel.stackexchange.com/q/10640/2509\">Travel.SE</a> it was pointed out that in Georgia (the country), a visitor would have use of learning Georgian, Russian, and Armenian. That's three very different languages, with three quite different scripts, for such a small country! That prompts me the question:</p>\n\n<p>In what country do we find the highest <em>linguistic density</em>? I don't know if this concept exists, but I mean the geographic derivative of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_distance\">linguistic distance</a>: e.g. a country where very different languages are natively spoken in a small area. Of course, this tends to infinity close to the language border, so let's stick to countries for now.</p>\n", "Id":"2836", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Where do we find the highest \"language density\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-11-13T09:19:28.510", "AnswerCount":"3", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1254", "Tags":"<cross-linguistic><comparative-linguistics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"239", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-21T02:10:58.373", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.topjaklont.org/", "Location":"Kiruna, Sweden", "Id":"1254", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"935589", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"143", "CreationDate":"2012-08-14T11:46:49.237", "DisplayName":"gerrit", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-29T16:08:42.127", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in atmospheric remote sensing in Kiruna, SÃ¡pmi (Lapland), Sweden. I first came to Stack Exchange for practical reasons: Tex.SE has been of major help when I wrote my licentiate (midterm) thesis. Since then, I have discovered the joy of many websites. As my network profile will show, I'm interested in travel, outdoor, scientific skepticism, and as I work in academia, also in academia and LaTeX.</p>\n"}}
