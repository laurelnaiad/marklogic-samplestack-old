{"Body":"<p>This is something of a long shot, but I am looking for narratives with English word-by-word glosses in languages that have proximate/obviative marking, direct/inverse marking (aka hierarchical alignment), or preferably both.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to know is how frequently in such narratives, and at what points in the narrative, you get topic switching, where a new referent becomes the proximate topic, and also whether and how this is overtly marked. In other words, how continuous the status of something as 'proximate' tends to be, and where in a narrative discontinuity tends to occur. For this, I need word-by-word glosses of naturally occurring narratives, because a translation by itself won't show the proximate/obviative morphology.</p>\n", "Id":"6340", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6381", "Title":"Glossed narratives in languages with proximate/obviative and/or direct/inverse marking?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-07T23:09:27.417", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<narrative><obviative><hierarchical-alignment>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"33", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-12T09:38:29.493", "Score":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
