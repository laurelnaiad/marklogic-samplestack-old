{"Body":"<p>I believe there was some important research published in recent decades which brought a fundamental change to the way linguists think about phonemes.</p>\n\n<p>Or is it that the concept of the phoneme has always been contentious despite its seeming wide acceptance to those of us who only dabble in linguistics?</p>\n\n<p>I seem to recall reading that a certain linguist studied a certain language and in the end decided that how we thought of phonemes just didn't apply to this language and that we instead had to look at things another way.</p>\n\n<p>Does my recollection have any truth to it? Who was the linguist and what is the groundbaking paper or name of the competing theory?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>I know the question is pretty vague so please help me improve it.
