{"Body":"<p>I recently found out the origin of the verb 'bring' as being derived from <strong>bher-</strong> (carry) and <strong>enk-</strong> (to go to) and how they fused together and came into Germanic as <strong>*bhrengk-</strong> then coming down into English as 'bring'. I was wondering if anyone knew if there was a way I could find out what other reflexes (if any) that <strong>*enk-</strong> had been preserved in any sort of form?</p>\n\n<p>Given it's a verb of motion I imagine it would have been able to be freely used metaphorically and potentially have been applied to many roots which I think could easily exist in modern languages. Is there a resource you know that might supply this information?</p>\n\n<p>Is this the only reflex of it that we're all aware of? Can anyone point to any other words that contain this? I've got quite a steady knowledge of historical linguistics but I've never gone back to any period further than Germanic or Latin so here's to diving back a bit deeper!</p>\n", "Id":"1399", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "Title":"PIE -enk reflexes in Modern English", "CreationDate":"2012-02-09T23:45:41.050", "OwnerUserId":"720", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<proto-indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-09T23:53:00.403", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
