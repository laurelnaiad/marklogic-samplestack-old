{"Body":"<p>Obviously, the degree to which loanwords enter a language is highly influenced by culture - for instance, a community which has a lot of contact with another culture, through which many new objects / concepts are introduced, will want to have words for those things.</p>\n\n<p>But I was wondering if there is are <strong>purely linguistic</strong> characteristics which make languages more or less likely to accept loanwords (or more generally, to be <em>changed by contact with another language</em>). In other words, are some languages inherently more \"influenceable\" than others, and if so, why?</p>\n", "Id":"2199", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2201", "Title":"Are there any linguistic factors that influence the degree to which a language accepts loanwords?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-03T01:10:05.420", "OwnerUserId":"544", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><borrowing><language-contact>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-07-03T11:01:17.363", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
