{"Body":"<p>Several linguists criticize prescriptivism. Stephen Pinker is probably the one to have made the strongest case against it. But, is their criticism based on a methodological principle (the abstraction of value judgements) or is it a statement of fact (that everything <em>has</em> the same value)? </p>\n\n<p>For example, both rap lyrics and Charles Dickens's novels can be considered as sources of data from which Linguistics tries to generalize the \"system of language\". As such, both sources have the same value. They are equally useful for analyzing patterns, generalizing principles, observing how the language is changing and so forth. But, in some sense, the standard variety is \"superior\", in that a Linguistics book itself could not be written using the “gansta rap” variety.</p>\n\n<p>So, how should the position of linguists against prescriptivism be understood?</p>\n", "Id":"155", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "FavoriteCount":"4", "AcceptedAnswerId":"156", "Title":"Why is prescriptivism criticized?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T01:15:02.097", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<philosophy-of-language><prescriptivism>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-15T07:01:04.963", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}, "ViewCount":"904", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-21T08:44:13.683", "Score":"13", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
