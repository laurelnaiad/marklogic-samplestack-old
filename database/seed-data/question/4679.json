{"Body":"<p>Traditionally, PIE phonology postulates three voiceless velar/uvular stops to PIE: </p>\n\n<p>*/ḱ/ (c), */k/ (q), */kʷ/ (q̆)</p>\n\n<p>But I made a search for a PIE dictionary with come 11-15 thousand words, and found only one occurrence of the combination ku̯, in word <strong><em>kroku̯a̯</em></strong> \"border post\" which is highly untypical, while kʷ is abundant.kʷ</p>\n\n<p>Given this fact, the only explanation that comes to mind is the idea that there was actually <strong><em>no</em></strong> kʷ in PIE but rather in most cases it was a combination ku̯. This theory would be refuted if there were many kʷ in the end of the roots: in that case after applying this theory we would have roots ending with -ku̯ which is prohibited. So I searched for -ekʷ- composition throughout the roots so to check if it actually frequent.</p>\n\n<p>And what I found? </p>\n\n<p>In many cases either the u̯ in -eku̯- can be part of a suffix, or the *kʷ can be actually reconstructed as *p!</p>\n\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>soq̆os</em></strong> \"sap\" - may be actually, <strong><em>sopos</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>teq̆os</em></strong> \"running water\" - may be actually, <strong><em>tequ̯os</em></strong> (suffix -u̯-)</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>a̯eq̆ea̯</em></strong> \"water body\" - may be actually <strong><em>a̯epea̯</em></strong> (this root a̯ep- for water is actually reconstructed along <strong><em>a̯eq̆ea̯</em></strong>)</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>u̯lq̆os</em></strong> \"wolf\" could be actually <strong><em>u̯lquos</em></strong> (suffix), or <strong><em>u̯lpos</em></strong> or <strong><em>lupos</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>coq̆r</em></strong> \"excrement\" could be <strong><em>copr</em></strong> (compare \"coprophagy\")</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>i̯eq̆r</em></strong> \"liver\" could be <strong><em>i̯epr</em></strong> (compare \"hepatitis\")</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>o̯oq̆</em></strong> \"eye\" could be <strong><em>o̯oqu̯-</em></strong>, a typical u-stem (while -q̆ stem is highly untypical)</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>peq̆ter</em></strong> \"cook\" could be <strong><em>pepter</em></strong> (compare \"peptide\"). </p>\n\n<p>If this is wrong, what could be the solution to the problem?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A similar solution that the voiced equivalent to q̆, ğ at the end of the roots, could be actually b may explain why PIE has very rare *b. For example, traditionally reconstructed <strong><em>e̯reğos</em></strong> \"darkness\" could be actually <strong><em>e̯rebos</em></strong> which literally coincides with Greek word for \"darkness\", \"erebos\"!</p>\n\n<p>See also this question <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/2832/what-evidence-supports-labialized-velars-in-pie\">What evidence supports labialized velars in PIE?</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note that the traditional phonology implies that in several unrelated branches such as Hellenic, Osco-Umbrian and Celtic, happened similar change:</p>\n\n<p>kʷ->p</p>\n\n<p>which seems to me highly unlikely. It also postulates</p>\n\n<p>kʷ->p->f in Germanic, but not root-initially!</p>\n\n<p>So that</p>\n\n<p>penkʷe -> finf</p>\n\n<p>u̯lkʷos -> wolf</p>\n\n<p>but </p>\n\n<p>kʷod -> what</p>\n\n<p>kʷor -> where</p>\n\n<p>This supports my idea that root-initially kʷ could be actually ku̯ but root-finally it was p because ku̯ root-finally is impossible due to sonority rule (u̯ being sonorant cannot be further from the root nucleus than stop k)</p>\n", "Id":"4679", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "Title":"Solution to a typological problem about PIE phonology: are there any facts that contradict this view?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-09T18:15:07.107", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><proto-indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-09T20:48:14.717", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "ViewCount":"120", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-17T03:39:45.293", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
