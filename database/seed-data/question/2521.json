{"Body":"<p>I was wondering if there were any current models that measured the effect of cultural shifts in a given language. Specifically, is there consistent/model-able lag between major cultural events and how it affects a language. </p>\n\n<p>In my instance, I am thinking in terms of the spread of Hellenism which resulted in the adoption of (Attic/Ionic -> Koine) Greek as <em>lingua franca</em> for a discernible period of time. Is there an existing way to measure/model the influence of Alexander's conquered areas on the \"base\" language? When did any Balkan influence appear?
