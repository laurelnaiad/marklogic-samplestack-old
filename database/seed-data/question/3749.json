{"Body":"<p>There are a number of positions you can take on what the relationship between syntax and semantics. </p>\n\n<p>You could think that syntax is prior and so think that an expression's syntactic function determines (or, weaker, <em>constrains</em>) the expression's semantic role. Or you could hold the converse (i.e., an expression's semantic role determines/constrains it's syntactic function). Finally, you could deny any significant connections exist and think that they are two largely orthogonal parts of language.</p>\n\n<p>Most people I talk to seem to agree that there is <em>some</em> relationship, but they're not sure what exactly it is.</p>\n\n<p>What views have linguists developed about the relationship between these two branches? What are some of the classic/canonical articles and what is the current state of the art?</p>\n", "Id":"3749", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"What is the relationship between syntax and semantics?", "CreationDate":"2013-05-22T06:19:42.873", "AnswerCount":"2", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1427", "Tags":"<syntax><reference-request><semantics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"1865", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-28T15:15:08.630", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1427", "AccountId":"1767381", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"186", "CreationDate":"2012-10-20T20:49:20.337", "DisplayName":"Dennis", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-25T02:23:38.723"}}
