{"Body":"<p>I'm looking for some comparative analysis that would indicate how <strong>imperative meaning</strong> can be built in various languages by using <strong>grammatical moods</strong> other than <em>imperative</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that in many languages you can build a phrase with suggestive or imperative meaning by using other tenses/moods/aspects, not necessarily imperative or suggestive.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>TL;DR samples</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dutch</strong>:<br>\n\"At liever eens wat minder!\" (lit. \"ate rather once somewhat less) means \"better eat a bit less\" <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/02/do-imperatives-in-the-past-tense-exist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">(link)</a>. In this case, <code>at</code>, a past perfect form of <code>eten</code>, forms an imperative, something like \"if you ate less\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Russian</strong> is maybe even more vivid example.
