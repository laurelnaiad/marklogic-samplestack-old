{"Body":"<p>I am a literacy researcher looking to create an add on package in R that offers quantitative methods for discourse analysis.  I am creating a function for taking a chunk of text and measuring the syllables per word so</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>x &lt;- c('dog', 'cat', 'pony', 'cracker', 'shoe', 'Popsicle', 'pronunciation' )</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>would yield:  1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 5</p>\n\n<p>Currently I have an algorithm that is about 90-95% accurate by following the these rules:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>The pattern <em>eeing</em> and <em>eing</em> counts as a 2 vowels (so seeing becomes sVV and being becomes bVV);</li>\n  <li>An e at the end of a word is just dropped (as in come) which is counted as cVm;</li>\n  <li>Two vowels next to each other (as in peach) is counts as one vowel sound (it becomes (pVch);</li>\n  <li>Any singular vowel left counts as a V (Yoda becomes YVdV);</li>\n  <li>The sum of the Vs is the number syllables in the word.;</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Things that throw a monkey wrench into the problem are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>compound words;</li>\n<li>non silent ending \"e\"s.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are the rule breakers that don't follow my algorithm. Does anyone know of a dictionary of syllable rule breaker words?  </p>\n\n<p>I know this available as this was an approach similar to that used by Franklin Mark Liang (A guru in the art of syllabication) in <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf\">his 1983 dissertation</a>.  This same approach is used by <a href=\"http://www.syllablecount.com/default.aspx\">the online syllable counter</a> and so I know such a dictionary exists. Having this dictionary to combine with my algorithm would make my approach very accurate.</p>\n", "Id":"1182", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1189", "Title":"Dictionary of atypical syllabication", "CreationDate":"2011-12-19T21:54:26.080", "OwnerUserId":"607", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><syllables>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-19T22:44:24.430", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
