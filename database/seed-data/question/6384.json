{"Body":"<p>What is the difference between grammatical categories \"Topic\" and \"Focus\"? They are both optional, and they succeed \"Force\" and they both seem to stress a part of text. Rizzi places them in the following order:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... Force ... (Topic) ... (Focus) ... fin IP</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the difference between them is not clear to me.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I found is that Topic allows known information to be fronted, whereas Focus introduces new information. Though that can't be all, right? I mean, I think it would be strange to solely base such a theory on Information Structure.</p>\n", "Id":"6384", "LastEditorUserId":"1082", "Title":"What is the difference between \"Topic\" and \"Focus\"", "CreationDate":"2014-01-13T11:37:34.843", "OwnerUserId":"1082", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><grammar><universal-grammar>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-15T09:48:01.850", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/1057670719/picture?type=large", "Id":"1082", "AccountId":"1174306", "CreationDate":"2012-06-07T16:38:25.203", "AboutMe":"<p>Thank you for stopping by!
