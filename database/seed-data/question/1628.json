{"Body":"<p>How does a linguist determine whether a pattern is grammatical in a language? Is there some kind of standard test? This is assuming that there is little documentation of the language and no authority. </p>\n\n<p>For example, without documentation, corpus, or authority, how can one determine whether S + [be] + V+ing is valid in English? Just make an example to a speaker and ask if he thinks it's grammatical? But there are dialects and individual dialects (idiolects), how can the linguist be sure that the grammaticallity is not just the test subject's dialect? How can the linguist know that the example sentence he gives can be generalized and is not an exceptional case (for example, some verbs cannot have S + be + Ving such as words of emotion).</p>\n", "Id":"1628", "LastEditorUserId":"794", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"How does a linguist determine whether a pattern is grammatical in a language?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-13T18:06:07.727", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<methodology><reconstruction><field-linguistics><grammaticality>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-14T07:01:09.933", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"238", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-14T18:37:55.053", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
