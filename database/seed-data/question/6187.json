{"Body":"<h3>Why?</h3>\n\n<p>I've taken a great interest in linguistics lately and want to learn more about the basic principles but also advanced topics we built into different languages.</p>\n\n<h3>What?</h3>\n\n<p>As I was browsing through Wikipedia, I tripped over an article about the so called <strong>distributive case</strong> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_case\" rel=\"nofollow\">link to article</a>). Instantly I tried to find out more about it, but alas this concept seems to be quasi non-existent in English and German (my 2nd and 1st language), so I tried to go with the Latin example in the German Wikipedia article.</p>\n\n<h3>Exapmle</h3>\n\n<p>The example:\n<em>bis bina sunt quattuor</em> (in numbers: 2 x 2 = 4)</p>\n\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n\n<p>My analsysis so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>bis</em> relates to the word <em>bi</em>, which simply means <em>two</em>. The suffix <em>-s</em> changes the meaning to <em>twice</em></li>\n<li><em>bina</em> means pairwise</li>\n<li><em>sunt</em> is basically third-person plural of <em>to be</em> (<em>sum</em> in Latin)</li>\n<li><em>quattuor</em> simply means <em>four</em>\n<br/><br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Problem</h3>\n\n<p>What I don't really understand now is why this sentence is like this.\nBasically the information for <em>two times</em> is doubly present in the example.\nOnce in <em>bis</em> and once <em>bina</em>.<br/>\nWhy isn't the sentence \"<em>bis bi sunt quattuor</em>\", which would roughly translate to \"<em>Two times two is four</em>\". Or maybe \"<em>bina bi sunt quattor</em>\", which would be something like \"<em>A pair of twos is four</em>\"?<br/>\nThe meaning of the example translates to \"<em>Two times a pair of twos is four</em>\", which sounds quite odd to me.</p>\n\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why is the sentence like the exapmle and not like one of my conceptions?</li>\n<li>Does anyone have more material about the distributive case itself?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Update</h1>\n\n<p>Question 1: Due to a wrong interpretation of the word <em>bina</em>, I mistranslated the sentence.<br/>\nQuestion 2: Thanks to a hint by Yellow Sky, I'm now collecting useful ressources about <em>collective numerals</em>, which are kind of a prestage for <em>distributive numerals</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"6187", "LastEditorUserId":"2897", "FavoriteCount":"0", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6188", "Title":"Distributive case in Latin", "CreationDate":"2013-12-18T10:23:36.490", "OwnerUserId":"2897", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<latin><cases><numerals>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-18T14:30:06.393", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hVpvA.gif", "Id":"2897", "AccountId":"3745711", "CreationDate":"2013-12-18T08:48:37.110", "AboutMe":"<p>Coming soon.</p>\n", "Age":"20", "Location":"Switzerland", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"13", "DisplayName":"McDonnough", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-20T08:31:55.613"}, "ViewCount":"47", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-18T14:30:06.393", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hVpvA.gif", "Id":"2897", "AccountId":"3745711", "CreationDate":"2013-12-18T08:48:37.110", "AboutMe":"<p>Coming soon.</p>\n", "Age":"20", "Location":"Switzerland", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"13", "DisplayName":"McDonnough", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-20T08:31:55.613"}}
