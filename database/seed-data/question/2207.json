{"Body":"<p>Is there any method of assigning a numerical score to the extent to which a given alphabet is phonemic?  If so, then obviously, the score for a given alphabet would vary across the languages that it was used to transcribe.   A great many scores could be assigned to the roman alphabet, since the latter is used to transcribe so many languages.  For example, the roman alphabet would score higher in \"phonemicness\" (phonematicity??) for Serbo-Croation than it would for English.    </p>\n", "Id":"2207", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2208", "Title":"Is there any method of assigning a numeral score to the extent to which a given alphabet is phonemic?", "CreationDate":"2012-07-04T03:09:24.680", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<alphabets>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"790", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"47", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-04T05:49:30.100", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
