Old Saxon endi, Old Frisian anda, Middle Dutch ende, Old High German enti, German und, Old Norse enn), from PIE *en; cognate with Latin ante, Greek anti (see ante). Phrase and how as an exclamation of emphatic agreement dates from early 1900s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since \"and\" is one of the most common words, I had expected it to trace back all the way to PIE, like words like mother or father, for example, but instead it seems it meant \"thereupon, next\" as recently as Old English.</p>\n\n<p>So, I have these questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is \"and\" a recent word?</li>\n<li>If so, what word performed its function before that?</li>\n<li>Did PIE have an unrelated word for \"and\", and if so, why did such a common word fall away from usage?</li>\n<li>Is \"and\" a cognate to Latin \"et\"?</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"6348", "LastEditorUserId":"2760", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6350", "Title":"Does \"and\" come from the PIE word for \"and\"?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-08T17:09:11.753", "OwnerUserId":"2760", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><etymology><proto-indo-european>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-09T15:07:38.760", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "DownVotes":"4", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf04366fafdd38ba6dbb9a24ba61acf6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2760", "AccountId":"229394", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"187", "CreationDate":"2013-11-22T15:57:47.410", "DisplayName":"sashoalm", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T17:38:32.493", "AboutMe":"<p>I have created an FTP server based on Qt that can run on Symbian and Maemo phones.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/qt-ftp-server/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/qt-ftp-server/</a></p>\n"}, "ViewCount":"113", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-10T07:16:59.480", "Score":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "DownVotes":"4", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf04366fafdd38ba6dbb9a24ba61acf6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2760", "AccountId":"229394", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"187", "CreationDate":"2013-11-22T15:57:47.410", "DisplayName":"sashoalm", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T17:38:32.493", "AboutMe":"<p>I have created an FTP server based on Qt that can run on Symbian and Maemo phones.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/qt-ftp-server/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/qt-ftp-server/</a></p>\n"}}
