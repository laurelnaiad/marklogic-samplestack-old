{"Body":"<p>As you know:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Almost all languages have the lexical categories noun and verb, but\n  beyond these there are significant variations in different languages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We want tag POS of some text of a lot of different languages, but I need a tag set that be consistent among different languages, e.i. if a POS exist in some language I need tag it with same tag string. Is there any tagging set that contains tag for at least for multiple languages?</p>\n\n<p>I need a structure like following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>TAG         A            OM \n        (adverb)    (object mark)  \n------------------------------------\nArabic      +            -\nPersian     +            +\nEnglish     +            -\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: The article that is mentioned in Bjerva's answer is actually a \"universal tag set for common tag set\", I need a tag set that is not less informative and remain all POS imaginable among languages, but use same tag for POS that are common in a subset of languages.
