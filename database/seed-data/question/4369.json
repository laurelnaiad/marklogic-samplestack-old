{"Body":"<p>In a <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/4314/is-there-a-significance-to-word-order-in-asl\">prior question</a> I asked whether word order in ASL has a special significance, which naturally lead to another question: do any signed languages, that is languages communicated mostly if not fully through hand signs, have a case system to free up word order for, say, greater expressiveness or inflection? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1689/do-sign-languages-inflect\">Here I found a question along those lines</a>, but it dealt specifically with inflection and not cases. An example of the type of case system I'm asking about is that of Latin, where <em>agricola puerum necat</em> means \"the farmer kills the boy\" while, though not in typical word order, <em>agricolam puer necat</em> means \"the boy kills the farmer\" though the word order remains the same. </p>\n\n<p>Are there signed languages that use morphological case markers? Is that even possible? </p>\n", "Id":"4369", "LastEditorUserId":"2328", "Title":"Are there signed languages that have a case system?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-01T03:24:02.777", "OwnerUserId":"1165", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><cases><sign-languages>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-01T19:47:38.690", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
