{"Body":"<p>I've been having some trouble understanding how is it that what differentiates, for example, /p/ from /b/, is the vibration of the vocal chords, present in /b/, but not in /p/. From what I have read and have been told, /b/ can't be produced without the vibration of the vocal chords. But, for my untrained ear and amateur testing, it seems it is possible to produce both /b/ and /p/ while whispering (therefore, voicelessly).</p>\n\n<p>So I'm really confused. I understand how /s/ has to be voiceless and /z/ has to be voiced, but not in cases like /t/ versus /d/. I've heard the opinion that the difference is <em>clearer</em> if the vocal chords vibrate, even though this is not the primary distinctive feature between them. So is it just a conventional practice for easier reference or does my judgement trick me?</p>\n", "Id":"3398", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3401", "Title":"Understanding Voiced Consonants", "CreationDate":"2013-03-18T13:42:16.640", "OwnerUserId":"1874", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><phonetics><consonants><voicing>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-19T03:03:18.220", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"198", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-19T03:03:18.220", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1874", "AccountId":"2509845", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"18", "CreationDate":"2013-03-18T13:42:16.640", "DisplayName":"Pedro Y.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-01T15:56:22.023"}}
