{"Body":"<p>How do tone languages assign phonemic tones to loanwords from non-tone languages?  For example, does such assignment vary according to the phonological context in each loanword?  Alternatively, does each tone language have a typical pattern of tones that it assigns to such loanwords?  Are there such things as strategies for such tone-assignment that are common across contour tone languages?   Across register tone languages?   Across both types?   </p>\n", "Id":"1780", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"3", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1781", "Title":"How do tone languages assign phonemic tones to loanwords from non-tone languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-04-12T19:34:15.610", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><borrowing><tone>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-12T22:16:45.897", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"279", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-11T19:39:54.367", "Score":"14", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
