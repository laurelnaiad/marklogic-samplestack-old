{"Body":"<p>I am looking to see if anyone can help me understand the difference between these similar sounds:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ĝ &amp; ĵ (gx &amp; jx)\nc &amp; s\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have been told the gx is like the j in jail or the g in gem &amp; that the jx is like the s in fusion or the j in bonjour. However, when I actually hear speakers or listen to audio clips, they sound much more similar than that.</p>\n\n<p>For the c and s, I'm totally confused. I had not even realized they were two different sounds until I read somewhere that the letters in Esperanto always sound the same and no two letters are to be used interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>If I could figure out what these (as well as some others that come up, but I can't remember now) sound like, then it would really help my study of the language. I have found it to be extremely enjoyable (And I used to specifically hate learning foreign languages through self-study) and would like to continue learning this.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried some google searches for references/resources and the best I have thus far is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_orthography#Sound_values\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia - Esperanto#Sound Values</a> article. It doesn't help me because I have no experience with the IPA.</p>\n", "Id":"2418", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2421", "Title":"Esperanto Pronunciation jx and gx & c and s", "CreationDate":"2012-08-14T18:16:51.987", "OwnerUserId":"1255", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<pronunciation><esperanto>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-14T20:28:25.580", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
