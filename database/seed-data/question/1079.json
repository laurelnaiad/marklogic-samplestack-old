{"Body":"<p>In astronomy we have the Aurora Australis in the south and the Aurora Borealis in the north. According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemoi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>, <em>auster</em> is in fact the Latin equivalent of the Greek <em>νότος</em>, or southern wind. However, <em>boreas</em> is a Greek word, <em>βορέας</em>, not Latin! The Latin equivalent is <em>aquilo</em>. So, are the \"southern lights\" derived from a Latin word whereas the \"northern lights\" are derived from a Greek word? I can think of other places where <em>auster</em>/<i>boreas</i> are used as south/north. I find it unusual that this common pair would be derived from two different languages. How did this convention arise?</p>\n", "Id":"1079", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1082", "Title":"Why is \"Aurora Borealis\" from Greek, but \"Aurora Australis\" from Latin?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T18:16:49.693", "OwnerUserId":"536", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><english><latin><greek>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-23T07:43:49.767", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"1077", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-23T07:43:49.767", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
