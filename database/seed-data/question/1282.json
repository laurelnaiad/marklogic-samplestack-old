{"Body":"<p>In the article <a href=\"http://apps.cla.umn.edu/directory/items/publication/301162.pdf\">The Elusive Butterfly. Iconicity in Language</a> (2001), William O. Beeman draws attention to the fact that most languages do not share a root for their word for butterfly. In other words, there is a serious resistance against borrowing for this word among languages. He then points out that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The terms for butterfly have several things that generally unite them: they\n  involve a degree of repetitious sound symbolism, (Hebrew <em>parpar</em>; Italian\n  <em>farfale</em>) and they use visual and auditory cultural metaphors to express the\n  concept. Inspecting the list of butterfly terms, it is easy to see how these\n  principles play out in the construction of the terms. In each case, with the\n  many cases of reiterated b's, p's, l's and f's (in widely separated language\n  families) one can almost hear the gentle rustle of butterfly wings and see\n  their repetitive motion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In languages where this reiteration does not occur (as is the case for German <em>Schmetterling</em> and English <em>butterfly</em>), the name is coined after culture-specific assumptions and myths. According to the author, this is one of those linguistic puzzles that have \"lurked at the edges of scholarship\". </p>\n\n<p>Has any serious linguistic study been done on the topic ever since? If <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_symbolism\">phonesthesia</a> is really behind the phenomenon, why does it seem to occur <em>only</em> with that species &ndash; and not, let's say, with cats, flowers, birds etc?</p>\n", "Id":"1282", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1287", "Title":"Why do languages not share a root for \"butterfly\"?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-14T23:54:55.143", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics><roots>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-16T06:43:51.640", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"479", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-16T06:43:51.640", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
