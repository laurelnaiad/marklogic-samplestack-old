{"OwnerDisplayName":"John Lemley", "Body":"<p>The Greek work <em>opse</em> meant <em>late</em> in Homer. By the time of Philostratus (3rd c. A.D.) it sometimes had the meaning of <em>too late</em>.  Of course, if someone arrives too late for an event, they arrive \"after\" it. </p>\n\n<p>Modern Greek doesn't have the word <em>opse</em>. My theory is that the adverb <em>opse</em> (<em>late</em>) morphed into a preposition (<em>after</em>).  But, Greek already has <em>meta</em> meaning <em>after</em>. So, <em>opse</em> faded out of existence.  Does my theory seem correct? Is it way off base? Your critique will be most valuable for my research.</p>\n", "Id":"3908", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Did the Greek adverb for late evolve into a prepostion meaning after?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-25T04:29:51.287", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><greek>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-25T15:01:49.163", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"52", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-25T15:01:49.163", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"0"}
