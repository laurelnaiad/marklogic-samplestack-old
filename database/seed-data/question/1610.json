In the comments, Mark Beadles helpfully pointed out that center-embedding is absent from Sanskrit in the early Vedic period, but you see some embedding in the later Vedic period.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing about this is that the later Vedic period is past Homer's time by an amount too short for reasonable spreading of the technique. Further, Alexander the Great would not have brought Greek recursion to India until a few centuries later. So this might be a separate independent invention of recursion.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the date of the earliest center embedding in Vedic Sanskrit?</li>\n<li>Is there any evidence of Greek/Indian contact which pre-dated this production?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This would be another nice data point in the fascinating history of the spread of recursive speaking and writing throughout the ancient world.</p>\n", "Id":"1610", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"How did Sanskrit embedding evolve?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-09T18:56:46.590", "OwnerUserId":"810", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<universal-grammar><sanskrit>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-10T11:49:26.077", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.

Chomsky was wrong. I want to know how recursion spread from Greece through the old world, and it seems we will find out. I am also curious about simpler examples of recursion, like list making.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly blindly follow Gell-Mann and agree with Joseph Greenberg about superfamilies and mass-comparison. I don't see any reason that the mass-comparison method cannot be made rigorous with good statistics.</p>\n\n<p>I like formal grammars, and I don't believe I understand something unless I can program a computer to understand it the same as me. My linguistic goal today is to write a good English parser. I think I can do at least marginally better than current parsers, which seem to be weighed down with theoretical cruft. Maybe it'll read a newspaper, maybe not. I hope to find out soon enough.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"New York City", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"92", "Reputation":"481", "DisplayName":"Ron Maimon", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-02T00:11:46.293"}}
