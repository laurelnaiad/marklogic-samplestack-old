{"Body":"<p>Why are English loanwords ending in /d/ or /t/ systematically transcribed into Hangul syllables ending in ㅅ rather than ㄷ? This seems strange, since when ㅅ is followed by a vowel, the coda is realised as [ɕ] or [s]. Also, there are native words ending in ㄷ, which would be a better phonetic match. Is there a principle explaining why ㅅ might be preferred?</p>\n\n<p>For instance, <em>Internet</em> is transcribed in South Korea as 인터넷, yielding the pronunciation [in.tʌ.ne.ɕi] when followed by the subject particle 이, or [in.tʌ.ne.sɨɭ] followed by the object particle 을.</p>\n", "Id":"2805", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2807", "Title":"Korean syllable-final ㅅ in Hangul transcription of loanwords", "CreationDate":"2012-11-08T12:24:01.710", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><orthography><korean><transliteration><phonotactics>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-09T12:05:10.710", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
