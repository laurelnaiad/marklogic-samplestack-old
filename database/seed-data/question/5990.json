{"Body":"<p>Using the formal syllable identification rules, you have the following (with an example pronunciation):</p>\n\n<pre><code>MacDonald =&gt; Mac + Don + ald (`/məkdˈɒnl̩d/`)\nMcDonald  =&gt; McDon + ald (`/məkdˈɒnl̩d/`)\nKvitova   =&gt; Kvit + o + va (`/kəvˈɪtəvə/`)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, the number of vowel sounds (syllabic or not) in the last two examples does not match the syllable split. A (<code>/ə/</code>) has been inserted between two of the consonants.</p>\n\n<p>Does this pronunciation pattern change the syllabification rules to align with the number of spoken vowel/syllabic consonant sounds, or is it more a pattern of speech to smooth over adjacent consonants that do not flow easily together (e.g. the <code>kv</code> pair in <code>kvitova</code>)?</p>\n\n<p>With <code>Mc</code>, should this be considered a prefix like <code>be</code>, <code>de</code> and others are, and be considered a syllable on its own -- that is, should it follow the syllable pattern of <code>MacDonald</code>?</p>\n\n<p>If <code>Mc</code> should be considered a syllable, is the <code>c</code> the nucleus?
