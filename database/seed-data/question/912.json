{"Body":"<p>As far as I know linguists consider language arbitrary. If so, how does etymology work? We have a word and we trace it back to its origins. Then, we find that it either comes from a different language or originated at a certain time. But then what? We have no idea how the word originated originally or why it came to mean what it does. So do we have any idea how or why any word came to mean what it does, originally? And if not, because language is arbitrary, then words got their meanings by someone just deciding a certain sound would represent a certain meaning and people went along with it?</p>\n", "Id":"912", "LastEditorUserId":"76", "Title":"How did the first words arise?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-30T12:29:33.193", "OwnerUserId":"467", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><origin-of-language>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-31T21:06:49.263", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"35", "WebsiteUrl":"http://github.com/alekstorm", "Id":"76", "AccountId":"411223", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:34:32.303", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Urbana, IL", "DownVotes":"17", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1043", "DisplayName":"Alek Storm", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T07:20:27.393"}, "ViewCount":"350", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-08T09:57:38.003", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"http://english.stackexchange.com/users/12762/mark", "Id":"467", "AccountId":"894690", "CreationDate":"2011-10-30T12:21:14.843", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a native English (American) speaker.<br> I studied linguistics and journalism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. <br>In the past I worked as a freelance journalist in English media in Israel and am currently a content writer and editor for a U.S.-based home improvement website. <br>\nI enjoy linguistics and grammar, and am especially intrigued by the translation of idioms, slang and metaphors.</p>\n", "Age":"31", "Location":"Israel", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"133", "DisplayName":"Mark", "LastAccessDate":"2012-04-18T14:49:52.557"}}
