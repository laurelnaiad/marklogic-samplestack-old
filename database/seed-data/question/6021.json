{"Body":"<p>English has a somewhat unusual construction exemplified by sentences like the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>He had his car stolen.</li>\n<li>He had his house repossessed.</li>\n<li>He's had three books published.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are different from the causative <em>have</em> construction: e.g. (1) doesn't mean \"He caused his car to be stolen\". What this construction seems to do is line up the subject with an argument that could be called an \"affectee\", i.e. someone affected by the action; another term might be \"beneficiary\", but in the broad sense of a referent who is either advantaged or disadvantaged by the action.</p>\n\n<p>I have three questions about this construction, one synchronic, one diachronic, and one typological:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What are the semantics of this construction? What constraints are there on the semantic role of the subject and its relationship to the action of the verb? For example, one constraint seems to be that the subject should be aware of the action: <em>He had his car stolen, but he didn't realize it</em> sounds strange to me. Also, it seems like the action has to be agentive (though the agent is someone other than the subject): <em>He had his key lost</em> is obviously bad. </li>\n<li>When and how did this construction arise? Is it historically an extension of the causative <em>have</em> construction?</li>\n<li>What other languages have similar constructions, i.e. ones that line up the subject with an \"affectee\" or \"beneficiary\" argument, and what do these look like morphosyntactically? (The \"benefactive pivot\" construction of some Philippine languages seems to be one example.)</li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"6021", "LastEditorUserId":"2411", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6024", "Title":"The \"affectee-subject HAVE\" construction in English", "CreationDate":"2013-11-27T19:49:29.080", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><english><historical-linguistics><semantics><linguistic-typology>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-28T03:12:01.583", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}, "ViewCount":"96", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-28T07:03:53.737", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"80", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"24", "Id":"2411", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e5b9f5cfa370b99b7b7fdaa27454de1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3231657", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"1342", "CreationDate":"2013-08-28T19:22:30.673", "DisplayName":"TKR", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:45:52.557", "AboutMe":""}}
