{"Body":"<p>The Wikipedia entry for <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund\" rel=\"nofollow\">gerund</a></em> starts with a list that shows how the term is applied to various languages. And we can see that what the term actually means depends a lot on the specific language we are referring to. For example, it can be a verbal noun in Turkish, an adverbial participle in Portuguese, an adjectival participle in French, part of the infinitive  in Hebrew and so on.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, the term \"gerund\" (as many others, like \"perfect\", \"imperfect\" etc) was coined by traditional grammarians, focusing primarily on Greek and Latin. But, from a linguistics perspective, is \"gerund\" a term that can be unambiguously defined for any language? If so, what all these different applications of the term have in common?</p>\n", "Id":"1023", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1029", "Title":"Can the term \"gerund\" be linguistically defined?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-15T13:25:52.717", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><parts-of-speech><gerund>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-15T22:14:08.687", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"210", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-15T23:21:41.640", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
