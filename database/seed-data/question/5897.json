{"Body":"<p>English is the preferred language in many fields of study and in international communications, it has more vowel sounds than many languages, but a compact alphabet, which in my opinion is why English words and sentences are short, compared to other languages.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is if there could be a correlation between the wide acceptance of English and its compact alphabet and relative high number of vowel sounds?</p>\n\n<p><strong>As per comments:</strong></p>\n\n<p>What I mean for compact alphabet is a small number of symbols to construct words and sentences, thus chinese would have much more written symbols than english. So written english would be much easier to learn that written chinese, due a fewer number of symbols.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding to vowel sounds, chinese would have much less vowel sounds than english. Thus spoken chinese would be much easier to learn than spoken english due to its fewer vowel phonemes.</p>\n", "Id":"5897", "LastEditorUserId":"1522", "Title":"Correlation between vowel sounds and compact alphabet used in English and its acceptance", "CreationDate":"2013-11-13T02:04:22.657", "OwnerUserId":"1522", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonemes><alphabets>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-15T00:01:01.773", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1522", "AccountId":"1541936", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2012-11-24T05:40:35.230", "DisplayName":"rraallvv", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-04T20:52:05.717"}, "ViewCount":"97", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-16T17:18:10.237", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1522", "AccountId":"1541936", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2012-11-24T05:40:35.230", "DisplayName":"rraallvv", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-04T20:52:05.717"}}
