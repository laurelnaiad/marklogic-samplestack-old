{"Body":"<p>Questions about grammatical gender abound on this forum and on other linguistics forums. It's well known that in general, grammatical gender need not coincide with natural gender.</p>\n\n<p>However, I am interested in whether there exist languages in which the grammatical gender of a given name appears not to coincide with the natural gender to which that name is generally assigned. </p>\n\n<p>I will exclude ambigeneric names and names belonging to non-human/neuter noun classes. The question is whether, in any languages you know of, a given name of feminine grammatical gender is used as a masculine given name, or vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I know of one case where this apparent constraint was strong enough that a Japanese female name ending in -o became a Latin first declension noun ending in -a, to avoid a conflict between grammatical and natural gender -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aAkihitum-et-michikam.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">when Princess Michiko of the Chrysanthemum Throne visited Salamanca University</a>!</p>\n", "Id":"1937", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1942", "Title":"Proper names: does grammatical gender imply natural gender?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T12:51:26.210", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<morphology><gender>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-15T14:12:42.997", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
