{"Body":"<p>What is the current accepted origin of the Japanese particles no/na/ni/ga?</p>\n\n<p>One account I heard was that all were descended from a common root: an existential verb nu or ni, where ni was the infinitive/conjunctive form, and no/na/ga are various evolutions of the non-finite/adjectival or irrealis forms. Another account I heard was that ga and no were true particles (ga being a more concrete genitive relation and no being a more abstract genitive relation), while na is a shortened form of naru/nari (which might itself be a contraction of ni aru/ari). I wouldn't be surprised if there were other explanations.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an accepted etymology for some or all of these particles?</p>\n", "Id":"4687", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4691", "Title":"Etymology of Japanese no/na/ni/ga?", "CreationDate":"2013-10-10T05:24:12.210", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><japanese><particles>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"142", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-10T11:46:45.693", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/JustinOlbrantz", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1097", "AccountId":"1561933", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"470", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T15:27:45.637", "DisplayName":"Justin Olbrantz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T02:48:30.797"}}
