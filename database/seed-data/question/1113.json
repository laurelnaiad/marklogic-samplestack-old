{"Body":"<p>Before I had heard any spoken, Russian was one of my favorite languages. I used to have fun just reading Russian dictionaries, and I thought I'd soon learn to speak it. But when I tried to find some recordings, I felt that what seemed to be the 'main' Russian accent was not to my taste.</p>\n\n<p>It stands to reason that a language with very extensive geographical spread will also develop more than one accent, over time. I am interested in knowing what the main accents are regarding Russian as it is spoken today among native speakers. I am particularly interested in how vowel articulation might differ geographically. To a lesser extent, I am interested in geographical variation in sentence intonation.</p>\n", "Id":"1113", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1122", "Title":"What are the main accents of modern Russian among native speakers?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-05T19:41:31.800", "OwnerUserId":"230", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<accent><intonation><russian>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-05T19:48:02.660", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
