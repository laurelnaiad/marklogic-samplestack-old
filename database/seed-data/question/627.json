{"Body":"<p>We've had questions about inflected languages moving towards analytic morphology and about isolating languages moving to agglutinating morphology but we haven't yet investigated the third case.</p>\n\n<p>In the typological cycle theory languages slowly move from one morphological type to the next in a fixed cycle.</p>\n\n<p>What are some examples of agglutinating languages such as Finnish, Hungarian, or Turkish merging some agglutinations into inflections?</p>\n\n<p>If not in these, other agglutinative languages or partially agglutinative ones like Japanese verbs. Also if I'm a bit off in the kinds of changes, correcting me on that would also be interesting (-:</p>\n", "Id":"627", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"What are some examples of well-known agglutinatve languages moving toward inflecting morphology?", "CreationDate":"2011-09-30T10:29:08.253", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><inflection><typological-cycle><agglutination>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-30T19:14:40.427", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
