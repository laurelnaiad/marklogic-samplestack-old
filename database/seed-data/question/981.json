{"Body":"<p>The following joke is popular:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An MIT linguistics professor was lecturing his class the other day. “In English,” he said, “a double negative forms a positive. However, in some languages, such as Russian, a double negative remains a negative. But there isn’t a single language, not one, in which a double positive can express a negative.”</p>\n  \n  <p>A voice from the back of the room piped up, “Yeah, right.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I wonder how common is the phenomenon. \"yeah, right\" isn't exactly double-positive, or at least it relies on intonation to convey the negative meaning. However, in Bulgarian \"да, да\" (\"da, da\" = \"yes, yes\") almost always means \"no\" (still, intonation plays a role).</p>\n\n<p>What other languages exhibit this phenomenon?</p>\n", "Id":"981", "AcceptedAnswerId":"983", "Title":"Is \"double positive meaning negative\" a common phenomenon?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-08T10:25:03.483", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<negation>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"80", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"1503", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-09T16:55:30.513", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"http://techblog.bozho.net", "Id":"80", "AccountId":"70258", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:45:02.257", "AboutMe":"<p>Bozhidar Bozhanov - Senior Java developer (<a href=\"http://bozho.net/cv/Bozhidar_Bozhanov_CV.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CV</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Creator of <a href=\"http://welshare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://welshare.com</a></p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Sofia, Bulgaria", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"753", "DisplayName":"Bozho", "LastAccessDate":"2012-08-08T11:21:15.973"}}
