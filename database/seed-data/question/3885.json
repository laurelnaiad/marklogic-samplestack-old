{"Body":"<p>The  infinitive form of the verb in Eastern Armenian (provided there are infinitives) is a suppletive 'linEl'. I am surprised to notice its resemblance to most Finno-Ugric words of similar meaning, e.g.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>   Finnish     lienee    (Potentialis of olla = to be in 1st p.sg. affirmative)\n   Hungarian   lenni     (to be)\n   North Sami  leat      (to be)\n   Komi        [lony]    (to become, to be, to turn into)\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are the oldest records of the Armenian verb? Are there any correlates in Iranian and/or Paleo-Balcanic languages?
