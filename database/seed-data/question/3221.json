{"Body":"<p>In Arabic, the root S-L-M (س ل م) has a general meaning of \"Peace\", but can also be used for \"Submission\" (such as in the words Islam/Muslim).  Given the close relation between Hebrew and Arabic, I'm curious to know whether the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0-L-M\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hebrew Sh-L-M</a> (ש ל ם) can be similarly interpreted thus.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, was this root ever used to refer to those who <em>whole-heartedly submitted</em> themselves to the Mosaic Law (and thus to G-D's authority)?  If not, was a different term (with similar meaning) used for these people, in order to distinguish them  as the best followers among the children of Israel?</p>\n\n<p>I got following Hebrew terms from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0-L-M\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mushlam</strong> (מושלם) — perfect</li>\n<li><strong>Shalem</strong> (שלם) — whole, complete</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Have these concepts ever been extended to <strong>perfect</strong> (<em>Mushalam</em>) followers or <strong>complete</strong> (<em>Shalem</em>) submission in any literature and can  root ש ל ם be used to mean “Submission” ?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Would also be interested to know the answer for other related languages like Aramaic or any ancient  biblical period languages?</p>\n", "Id":"3221", "LastEditorUserId":"1758", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3875", "Title":"Can the root ש ל ם be used to mean “Submission”?", "CreationDate":"2013-02-18T09:21:07.130", "OwnerUserId":"1758", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><semantics><arabic><hebrew><cognates>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-25T14:39:49.377", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EVrHW.jpg", "Id":"1758", "AccountId":"904615", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"170", "CreationDate":"2013-02-13T05:16:10.560", "DisplayName":"Ali", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-15T10:46:17.913"}, "ViewCount":"219", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-14T11:29:02.600", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EVrHW.jpg", "Id":"1758", "AccountId":"904615", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"170", "CreationDate":"2013-02-13T05:16:10.560", "DisplayName":"Ali", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-15T10:46:17.913"}}
