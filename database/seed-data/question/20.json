{"Body":"<p>English and Spanish each have one main verb for \"to like\".</p>\n\n<p>In English \"to like\", the grammatical subject must be the one doing the appreciating:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I like her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But with Spanish \"gustar\", the person appreciating must be the grammatical object:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ella me gusta.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Spanish has a few other common verbs which also are opposite the English such as \"encantar\" vs \"to love\".</p>\n\n<p>But my questions is simply whether there is a term to describe such verbs which have the subject and object the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>Something like \"valence\" or \"mode\" or \"directionality\". Is there a term for this?</p>\n\n<p>(I'm having trouble wording both the question title and the question body so please jump in and improve it, or leave constructive comments which I'll use to improve the question.
