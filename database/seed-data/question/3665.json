{"Body":"<p>I'm curious why every language I've heard of has back or central vowels. Are there any languages that exclusively uses front vowels (say the phonemes /a/, /e/, /i/, /y/)? I want to know this more or less because I'm making a simple conlang that I want to only use front vowels - would this in real life be unstable and lead to language evolution that generates back vowels?</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, shouting and screaming generally involve front vowels. Is there some natural vocalization resulting in back vowel sounds, which would lead to inclusion in language?</p>\n", "Id":"3665", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3680", "Title":"Are there any languages with only front vowels?", "CreationDate":"2013-05-08T16:02:16.590", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<phonology><vowels>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2028", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"305", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-27T16:07:05.330", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"27", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/y49By.png", "Id":"2028", "AccountId":"2107308", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"102", "CreationDate":"2013-05-06T22:04:41.097", "DisplayName":"user54609", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T13:32:50.887", "AboutMe":"<p>Katie in raining icebergs save unknown ricocheting Finns, master Immelmann ran an instinct dotca, kiss rat sap four.</p>\n"}}
