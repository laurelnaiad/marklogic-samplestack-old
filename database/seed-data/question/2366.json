{"Body":"<p>I consider myself a neo-Whorfian and see major flaws in universal grammar, but it doesn't seem to me like they are <em>truly</em> competing theories. Cutting out all of the parts about how language is acquired and how language has universal features, universal grammar seems to be more like a file format on a computer, while the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the program that writes to that file.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of evidence that language is influenced by culture and that thinking is influenced by language, but there is also a significant amount of evidence to indicate that human language has certain features, almost universally. It doesn't seem like these two theories actually conflict with each other, since they both explain similar but <em>separate</em> phenomena. Am I missing something here?</p>\n", "Id":"2366", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2374", "Title":"Are universal grammar and Sapir-Whorf really competing theories?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-06T01:36:00.523", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<universal-grammar><cognitive-linguistics><sapir-whorf-hypothesis>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"958", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"480", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-06T16:09:58.157", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"40", "WebsiteUrl":"http://labbook.net", "Id":"958", "AccountId":"266116", "CreationDate":"2012-04-26T04:27:19.147", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently a junior at Penn State pursuing a B.Phil. in Linguistics and a B.S. in Psychology with minors in Arabic and Statistics.
