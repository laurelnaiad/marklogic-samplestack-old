{"Body":"<p>Prof. John McWorther, in his <a href=\"http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2270\" rel=\"nofollow\">course on Linguistics</a>, said, in a lecture about principles and parameters: \"if a language is pro-drop, the verb attraction parameter is always set on. If a language isn't pro-drop, then it could go either way.\" Using his examples:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>John often kisses Mary (English, pro-drop: off, verb-attraction: off)</p>\n  \n  <p>Jean embrasse souvent Marie (French, pro-drop: off, verb-attraction: on)</p>\n  \n  <p>Beso normalmente Maria (Spanish, pro-drop: on, verb-attraction: on) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The examples above show that in English, the verb comes after the adverb, while in French, the verb comes before the adverb (it has moved from its original <code>V</code> position to the <code>T</code> position up in the tree). In Spanish, which is a pro-drop language, the verb has to come before the adverb, as in French. Now, consider the same example in Portuguese:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Normalmente beijo a Maria (Portuguese, pro-drop: on, verb-attraction: <strong>off</strong>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This piece of evidence seems to contradict the hypothesis above. In Portuguese, the subject pronoun can be omitted (pro-drop), but the verb does not have to move (although you could also say \"beijo normalmente a Maria\"). How can this be explained?</p>\n", "Id":"236", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"238", "Title":"Verb-attraction parameter in Portuguese", "CreationDate":"2011-09-17T00:47:23.583", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><minimalism><portuguese><parameters>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-24T09:43:02.197", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
