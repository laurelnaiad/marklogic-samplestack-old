{"Body":"<p>Italian is commonly cited as an example of a <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/635\">phonetically spelled language</a>. It is easy to guess how an Italian word is pronounced based on the way it is written, because each written symbol highly corresponds to a sound (with some exceptions). This is not the case with English and <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/459\">French</a>, for example. Series of sound changes (for example, the Great Vowel Shift) caused changes in pronunciations and the written form didn't catch up. </p>\n\n<p>Why didn't the same thing happen to Italian? It is an old language, and the Latin alphabet has been used since before the language existed. Did sound changes not happen? Or did they happen but the written form caught up? Or are the changes so systematic that the letter-sound correspondence still holds?</p>\n", "Id":"637", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"How did Italian manage to stay (mostly) phonetically spelled despite its long written tradition?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-01T18:22:50.313", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><orthography><sound-change><italian>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-06T06:01:07.937", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}, "ViewCount":"919", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-19T06:59:40.807", "Score":"13", "CommentCount":"16", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
