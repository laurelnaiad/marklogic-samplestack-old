It makes some sense, at least.\nWhere could we find support to trust or to distrust such claims?</p>\n", "Id":"3917", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "Title":"What is the history of the word \"addict\"?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-26T02:59:32.170", "OwnerUserId":"2192", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><etymology><latin><greek>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-26T11:19:08.943", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
