{"Body":"<p>Specifically I'm interested in the split between Structural Case and Morphological case.</p>\n\n<p>Structural Case has been part of Chomskyan syntactic theory since at least <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_and_binding_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Government &amp; Binding</a> (GB). Roughly, Case Theory in GB and the minimalist program state that all nominals in a grammatical sentence must have Structural Case and they move away from their base positions to get it. </p>\n\n<p>Morphological case, or m-case, is the more familiar case (nominative, accusative, dative) that surfaces phonologically on nominals in languages which do so. The most recent theories of m-case that I am aware of derive from Alec Marantz's 1991 paper \"Case and Licensing\" (which was later reissued as an intro to <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=blno4uttFO8C\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reuland (2000)</a>). </p>\n\n<p>When I last checked, Nominative and Accusative were assumed to be Structural Case and the rest were sort of up in the air.</p>\n", "Id":"947", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"953", "Title":"Are there any recent articles on the current state of Case theory?", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T02:16:12.623", "OwnerUserId":"297", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><morphology><inflection><cases>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-01T12:47:44.520", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"265", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-01T12:47:44.520", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"15", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Toronto, Canada", "Id":"297", "DownVotes":"3", "AccountId":"165876", "Views":"15", "Reputation":"382", "CreationDate":"2011-09-25T17:19:38.000", "DisplayName":"Dan Milway", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-16T15:34:03.560", "AboutMe":""}}
