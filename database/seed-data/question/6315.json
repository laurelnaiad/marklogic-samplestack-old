{"Body":"<p>I have a question regarding the initial part of stop consonants.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take /b/, the <em>voiced</em> bilabial stop consonant, as an example. Prior to the stop release, the lips are closed so airflow through the mouth is completely blocked. To vibrate the vocal cord, air is sent through the nose. Does that mean the initial part of /b/ is identical to the initial part of /m/, the bilabial nasal consonant?</p>\n\n<p>In practice, do voiced stop consonants sound the same as their nasal counterparts before the stop release?</p>\n", "Id":"6315", "Title":"Do voiced stop consonants sound the same as their nasal counterparts before the stop release?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-05T02:26:40.790", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2979", "Tags":"<voicing><stops><plosives><nasals>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"42", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-06T08:04:16.733", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d1174bb4a3c3c4717ab6343b9590c4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2979", "AccountId":"91325", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"121", "CreationDate":"2014-01-05T01:35:10.387", "DisplayName":"netvope", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T18:01:32.330"}}
