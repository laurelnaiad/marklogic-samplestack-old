{"Body":"<p>According to formal sementics propositions (semantic term for \"sentences\", \"clauses\") have truth value. The truth value shows whether sentence is true or false and it is denoted as 1 or 0. \nWhat about sentences that have failed in presupposition? Do they have truth value? \nEx: The king of USA lives in NY. \nHere, the interlocutor presupposes that the USA is ruled by the king, and s/he fails in his/her presupposition. So what be the truth value of this proposition?\nI think that it is impossible for proposition that has failed in presupposition to have a truth value but I am not sure. </p>\n\n<p>Note: here I am talking about the direct meaning of the word \"king\", not possible metaphoric. </p>\n", "Id":"3232", "Title":"What is the truth value of propostions that have failed in Presupposition?", "CreationDate":"2013-02-19T20:27:21.830", "OwnerUserId":"1469", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<semantics><references><truth-value>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"61", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-19T20:27:21.830", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"12", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1469", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7wMvF.jpg", "AccountId":"2013296", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"172", "CreationDate":"2012-11-05T19:59:04.463", "DisplayName":"Dariya", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T23:25:52.387", "AboutMe":""}}
