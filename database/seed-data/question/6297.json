{"Body":"<p>Imagine a new computer programming language whose keywords and all other syntax were in lojban (or equivalent language - will explain in a bit). Allowing lojban to be a \"natural\" language itself, would the resulting programmes appear to be natural language?</p>\n\n<p>This is my reasoning:</p>\n\n<p>Since all lojban  can be expressed in predicate logic (I believe), and all computer programmes can be expressed in predicate logic. Then there could be an isomorphism between lojban and computer programs. So every computer programme could be expressed in lojban, which to a native speaker would appear natural.</p>\n", "Id":"6297", "ClosedDate":"2014-01-03T11:32:21.740", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"6301", "Title":"Would a progamming language in lojban mean that program could be written in natural language?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-02T19:51:39.087", "AnswerCount":"1", "Tags":"<theoretical-linguistics><lojban>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2961", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"103", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-03T11:17:35.350", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"23", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://notconfusing.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/229e22b30aa6bb80ecad5dce20d11889?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2961", "AccountId":"1884847", "CreationDate":"2014-01-02T19:41:51.490", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm the Wikipedian in Residence for OCLC, trying to meld together pywikipediabot and R to effect.</p>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"Oakland, CA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"13", "DisplayName":"notconfusing", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-04T08:40:25.853"}}
