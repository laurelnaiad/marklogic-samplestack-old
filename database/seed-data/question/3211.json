{"Body":"<p>There is a word in Indian Bengali which is \"sala\", but in Banladesh Bengali it is pronounced as \"Hala\". The \"s\" becomes \"h\" in a Bangladeshi's tongue. Similarly \"Tsunami\" seems to be impossible to be pronounced (<em>ts</em> part); but it is asssumable Japanese can utter it. So why does such things happen? Is it because those who can utter hard constructs, have a letters in their alphabet which helps them pronouncing? Or is it totally a regional and anthropological thing?</p>\n", "Id":"3211", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Why do people from a certain region sometimes have difficulty pronouncing certain sounds?", "CreationDate":"2013-02-17T04:44:24.960", "OwnerUserId":"1770", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><pronunciation><phonemes>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-21T13:31:40.367", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"185", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-23T14:39:35.593", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/adhikarisubir", "Id":"1770", "AccountId":"1615706", "CreationDate":"2013-02-17T04:36:20.280", "AboutMe":"<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/1615706\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/1615706.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Mistu4u on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Mistu4u on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Currently I am promoting my own proposal in <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/62440/subir-adhikari\">Area51</a>.
