{"Body":"<p>Psycholinguistically, a lemma is an abstract conceptual form of a word. However from a lexicographic perspective, the lemma is merely the aorist or canonical form of a word.</p>\n\n<p>In English, the lemma of a verb is the 3rd person singular form; for a noun, it's the singular form.</p>\n\n<p>However for multi-word expression, we might need to use the plural form of a noun within the expression, e.g. \"kick_one's_heels\". Even if we don't consider multi-word expression to constitute a lemma, we have other inconsistencies of the criteria to give lemma status to a word, e.g. hooved(adj) vs hoofed(adj).</p>\n\n<p>The difficulty of selecting the \"canonical\" word form as the lemma increases when dealing with morphological more sophisticated languages such as Turkish too.</p>\n\n<p>What is a notion of lemma? How is it scientifically defined? Citations will be much appreciated.</p>\n", "Id":"4073", "LastEditorUserId":"724", "Title":"What is the notion of lemma?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-29T09:31:39.127", "OwnerUserId":"2202", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<lexicon><lexicography><lemmas>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-30T09:48:26.320", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}, "ViewCount":"133", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-21T12:19:01.563", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alvations", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ynWb.jpg", "Id":"2202", "AccountId":"302279", "CreationDate":"2013-06-29T15:12:45.953", "AboutMe":"<p>食飽未?</p>\n", "Location":"Singapore", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"60", "DisplayName":"alvas", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-04T19:41:10.407"}}
