{"Body":"<p>This could be an influence of the other my not-quite-native languages, but let's think about this: is Russian 'irregular' stress pattern really such a mess as we often think of it?</p>\n\n<p>E.g. the negation particle не when added to a verb could be pronounced differently. When a stress falls on the first syllable, it sounds as [ni]: <em>не помню; не слышу; не знаю; не спрашивай.</em></p>\n\n<p>When the stress falls on a syllable other than the first one, it is pronounced as [ne]: <em>не хочу; не желаю; не могу.</em></p>\n\n<p>Both [ni] and [ne] are unstressed, yet pronounced differently (well, in the articulation I hear, at least).</p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there any other evidence of such interdependance between stress location and  pronunciation in Russian (e.g. in  words with consonant/vowel change)?</p></li>\n<li><p>Could the shifting stress be related to specific grammatical forms?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is the Russian stress position unique to Eastern Slavic languages, or are there examples of 'irregular' stress patterns in other languages?</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"6382", "ClosedDate":"2014-01-16T09:00:45.493", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "Title":"Is Russian 'irregular' stress pattern really 'irregular'?", "CreationDate":"2014-01-12T21:53:48.010", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<pronunciation><slavic-languages><stress>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-14T21:21:00.023", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
