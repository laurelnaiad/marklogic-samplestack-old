{"Body":"<p>I'm looking for a book on comparative grammar, where the grammar of different languages and/or language families is described and compared.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A comment made me realize that the question is extremely broad. An example of a reference that I think would be ideal for my purposes is <a href=\"http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511704505\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a>. It's just that it was written in 1843! Also, books which describe grammar generically, but with examples from different languages, are of interest. It does not need to be research level, this is just for fun!</p>\n\n<p>Could anyone give some pointers? </p>\n", "Id":"4161", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Resources comparing grammars of different languages", "CreationDate":"2013-08-10T17:57:25.837", "OwnerUserId":"2325", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<reference-request><grammar>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-12T04:45:11.597", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"127", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-12T04:45:11.597", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"16", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2325", "AccountId":"2934219", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"133", "CreationDate":"2013-08-06T10:54:34.583", "DisplayName":"Daniel R", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T15:26:44.693"}}
