{"Body":"<p>While I was studying an infant's transcript, I realized that he deleted the [l] sound in \"alma\" [alma], a word in Turkish meaning \"do not take\". When he deleted the sound, the word became [a:ma]. There is another word; \"ama\" [ama] in Turkish meaning \"but\". These two words become similar unless he changes any sound.\nHowever, the infant utters them differently after deleting the sound. I wonder whether the infant delibaretely changes the first sound of \"ama\" meaning \"do not take\" to show that they are different words. Does he mentally try to show that he knows that they are different words and he cannot only utter the [l] sound?</p>\n", "Id":"1371", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Do infants deliberately change the words when they omit the sounds and these words are minimal pairs?", "CreationDate":"2012-02-05T12:00:14.990", "OwnerUserId":"640", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><language-acquisition><psycholinguistics><minimal-pairs>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-25T04:59:17.023", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"172", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-25T04:59:17.023", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"10", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Id":"640", "AccountId":"1143371", "CreationDate":"2012-01-02T19:14:46.613", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"24", "Location":"Istanbul", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"325", "DisplayName":"Serpil Karabüklü", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-26T18:38:15.053"}}
