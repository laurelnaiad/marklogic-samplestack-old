{"Body":"<p>According to the materials I possess or can find on the Internet, Georgian adverbs derived from nouns end in -ად (-ad) (unless the noun in the nominative ends in -ო (-o) or -უ (-u), in which case the adverb will end in -ოდ (-od) or -უდ (-ud), respectively.</p>\n\n<p>This is in fact the adverbial case of the noun. Adjectives also have an adverbial case which is just the bare stem without an ending.</p>\n\n<p>However I've just come across the word მწარედ (mtsared) \"bitterly\" which is related to the word მწარე (mtsare) \"bitter\". As you can see it ends in -ედ (-ed).</p>\n\n<p>Is this just an irregular inflection peculiar to this word, or is there a regular adjective → adverb process that I just haven't been able to find?</p>\n", "Id":"4069", "Title":"Why does the Georgian adverb მწარედ (mtsared) \"bitterly\" end in -ედ rather than -ად?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-28T13:32:13.413", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"51", "Tags":"<morphology><georgian><adjectives><irregular-forms><adverbs>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"60", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-31T18:09:19.433", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
