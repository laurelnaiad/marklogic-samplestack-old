{"Body":"<p>I've been immersed in the magic of languages since childhood (LOTR, Myst, Eragon) - and now that I'm dreaming up a world of my own, I'm interested in developing a unique and interesting language for it.</p>\n\n<p>There's many aspects of creating a language I can peg down myself, chief among them being design. However, I'm finding it really hard to get started on the structure: syntax and morphology. Are there resources online dedicated to detailing unique structural aspects of language?</p>\n\n<p>For example: I've taken a couple of courses in japanese, and I love the use of particles - tiny words (and sometimes even phonemes) that are meaningless on their own, but modify and give context to the words they're attached to. I've also studied the way that Tolkien formulated elvish, and while I love his creativity in formulating the alphabet, I have no interest in copying it. I want to find more examples of uncommon structure and syntax like these - any sites/books/resources out there that would enable my search?</p>\n", "Id":"3354", "LastEditorUserId":"1839", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3358", "Title":"Where to find examples of unique/uncommon syntax?", "CreationDate":"2013-03-11T14:16:41.737", "OwnerUserId":"1839", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><morphology><written-language>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-11T17:53:43.160", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "Location":"Everywhere, USA", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1839", "AccountId":"248794", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"113", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T20:37:30.193", "DisplayName":"CodeMoose", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-15T11:57:00.687", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm an Astrophysicist that couldn't resist the creative allure of front-end code.
