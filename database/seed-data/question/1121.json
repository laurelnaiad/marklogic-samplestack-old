{"Body":"<p>I've been struggling, for a couple of months now to find the term for a concept from computational linguistics. It means something like: <em>the minimum number of words that need to be placed after a given word to complete the meaning of a phrase</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple: 0</li>\n<li>See: 2</li>\n<li>Dream: 3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Essentially, the phrase \"green apple\" is logically fully complete, so there is no need to add new words after \"apple\". That's why its number is 0. The phrase \"I dream\" is incomplete, because after \"dream\" we need to place an object. In \"I dream about an apple\", we need 3 words to complete the meaning of the phrase (\"about\", \"an\" and \"apple\"). In \"I see an apple\" we need 2 words after \"see\".</p>\n\n<p>As I understand, this term is very close to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link grammar</a>, from Syntax Analysis. What is the name given to this concept in the literature?</p>\n", "Id":"1121", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1123", "Title":"Is there a term for \"the number of words that must follow a given word to complete a phrase\"?", "CreationDate":"2011-12-07T09:37:17.323", "OwnerUserId":"572", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><terminology><theoretical-linguistics><computational-linguistics>", "AnswerCount":"3", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-08T14:12:59.507", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"184", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-27T01:17:59.890", "Score":"4", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"7", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.sigrlami.eu", "Id":"572", "AccountId":"75048", "CreationDate":"2011-12-07T08:33:16.983", "AboutMe":"<p>Haskeller, Cryptography/Mathematics/Physics enthusiast, OSS &amp; OSHW supporter, DSP/SDR/CR pusher</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sigrlami\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/sigrlami</a></p>\n", "Age":"25", "Location":"Odessa, Ukraine", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"217", "DisplayName":"Sigrlami", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-26T13:24:51.303"}}
