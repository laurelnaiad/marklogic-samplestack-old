{"Body":"<p>In some grammar books, I see the term \"ambitransitive\" used to describe verbs that have two arguments in some contexts and one argument in others.   </p>\n\n<p>From what I've read on Wikipedia, there are generally two types of ambitransitive verb:</p>\n\n<p>First, we have those whose intransitive senses have sole arguments that stand for patients.   One such verb is \"cook\" as in \"The turnips cooked in the pot,' vs. \"We cooked the turnips\"?    </p>\n\n<p>Second, we have verbs whose intransitive senses have sole arguments that stand for agents.   One such verb is \"eat,\" as in \"We ate,\" and \"We ate turnips.\"    </p>\n\n<p>So I'm asking whether the term \"ambitransitive\" is a generally accepted term among linguists?
