{"Body":"<p>The paper <a href=\"http://home.hum.uva.nl/fg/working_papers/fdg_H&amp;M.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Functional Discourse Grammar</a> by Kees Hengeveld and J. Lachlan Mackenzie describes objects in FDG using notation like the formulae below.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>(π v1: [head (v1)Φ]: [σ (v1)Φ])</li>\n<li>(π M1: [(A1) ... (A1+N)] (M1): Σ (M1)), where N ≥ 0</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Much of the notation is described in the paper, e.g. square brackets describe non-hierarchical associations, but some such as circular brackets and colons are not. I am trying to read the paper without any linguistic background, I presume the notation would be obvious to students of linguistics. </p>\n\n<p>What is the basis of this notation, and is there somewhere I can read up on it? Alternately is the paper intended to describe and define the notation from scratch? </p>\n\n<p>I will try and clarify my current understanding. At a high level FDG is organised into a hierarchy of four levels, each of which consists of a number of layers. The first formula above describes the general structure of a layer, presumably as an algebraic function. Basically there are three components to each layer; an operator, a head, and a modifier. v1 is \"a variable of the layer in question\" - I'm not sure what this means, does the value of v1 identify which layer is being processed, or does it somehow represent some aspect of the actual language being generated?</p>\n\n<p>The second formula is an instance of a particular layer, in this case the \"Move\" layer. This is a topmost layer of analysis within a discourse - it either \"calls for a response or is itself a response\". I understand the formula says that the Move layer contains a number of Discourse Acts [(A1) ... (A1+N)]. I don't know what Σ(M1) means - instinctively I read \"sum of M1\", but expect that doesn't fit here. I also don't know how Φ fits in, it is described as \"a function ... a grammatical strategy which applies to the entire layer\" but I'm not quite sure what this means.</p>\n", "Id":"4368", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "Title":"What is the notation used in Functional Discourse Grammar?", "CreationDate":"2013-08-31T16:30:45.590", "OwnerUserId":"2420", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><notation>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-01T08:52:56.630", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
