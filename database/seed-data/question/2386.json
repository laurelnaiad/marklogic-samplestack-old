{"Body":"<p>English seems to have rules that are much more simple than its cousin German and its influencer French, as well as most of the languages that those are related to. What caused this? I suspect it's because there is so much influence on the language from two separate sources, but I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: By this I mean when it comes to conjugation and compound words and number of phonemes, etc., etc., English has simplified very much.</p>\n\n<p><em>Alternative question that basically means the same thing:</em> why has English simplified <em>more</em> than its cousins. PIE was much more complex, and I'm sure Proto-Germanic was much more complex as well; it's obvious that Latin is more complex than French, and I assume Proto-Germanic was much more complex than German. Why has English simplified one step further than these other two languages, in terms of grammatical complexity.</p>\n", "Id":"2386", "LastEditorUserId":"958", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2404", "Title":"Why is English so much more simplified than other, similar languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-07T14:10:33.197", "OwnerUserId":"958", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<syntax><morphology><language-change>", "AnswerCount":"5", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-07T15:54:12.657", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"40", "WebsiteUrl":"http://labbook.net", "Id":"958", "AccountId":"266116", "CreationDate":"2012-04-26T04:27:19.147", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently a junior at Penn State pursuing a B.Phil. in Linguistics and a B.S. in Psychology with minors in Arabic and Statistics.
