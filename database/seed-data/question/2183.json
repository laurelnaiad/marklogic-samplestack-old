{"Body":"<p>Inspired by <a href=\"http://dailyinfographic.com/what-are-the-hardest-languages-to-learn-infographic\">this infographic</a>, which lists a bunch of languages as either easy to learn, hard to learn, or medium. I noticed that all the languages in the easy category were either Romance or Germanic languages, about half of the medium category was Indo-European, and none of the four hard languages were Indo-European.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly for English, there's some correlation between genetic similarity and ease of foreign language acquisition. I'm wondering how much this pattern holds for other language families.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if the same chart was made from the point of view of a Mandarin speaker, which languages would be in the easy category and which in the hard category? Would Tibetan, a language related to Chinese, be easier for a Mandarin speaker than Vietnamese, which is not? How much easier is it for a Mandarin speaker to learn Japanese (as compared to an English speaker)?</p>\n\n<p>I've looked for equivalent infographics / data for languages other than English, but so far I haven't found any. Either scientific or anecdotal evidence is fine.</p>\n", "Id":"2183", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Relationship between language similarity and ease of foreign language acquisition?", "CreationDate":"2012-06-28T16:40:01.367", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"534", "Tags":"<language-acquisition><language-families>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"534", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-17T17:26:36.930", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"534", "AccountId":"33415", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"257", "CreationDate":"2011-11-25T05:35:51.900", "DisplayName":"Lucky", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-22T21:23:41.730"}}
