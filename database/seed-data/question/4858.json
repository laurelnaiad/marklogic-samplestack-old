{"Body":"<p>Let's pretend we are producing four-language cross-dictionary.<br>\nFor it to be more difficult, let it be a Russian-English-Japanese-Sanskrit dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>By \"cross-dictionary\" I mean that the person using it will be able to look up any <em>word</em> in any of four supported languages and have four different articles describing the same <em>term</em> which this <em>word</em> means.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong>\nAll four languages have a <em>word</em> for <em>term</em> \"fire\" (I mean not a \"forest fire\" but just a generic \"fire\"). So, we have a binding of four words:</p>\n\n<p>Огонь / Fire / 火 / अग्नि</p>\n\n<p>Users of this dictionary will be able to look up any of these words and get the four articles describing the same term \"fire\". Each of these articles would be the usual dictionary article, of course, with all other possible meanings/readings/inflexions/etc of the word.</p>\n\n<p>Question is: what problems should be solved (and preferably, <em>how</em> they can be solved) when making such a dictionary?</p>\n", "Id":"4858", "ClosedDate":"2013-11-16T17:54:07.133", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4859", "Title":"What problems should be solved when making multi-language dictionary?", "CreationDate":"2013-11-06T10:48:46.090", "OwnerUserId":"2690", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<english><cross-linguistic><dictionary><lexicography>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-07T04:10:04.493", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"81", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-07T04:10:04.493", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://about.me/hijarian", "Id":"2690", "AccountId":"325791", "CreationDate":"2013-11-06T10:36:51.013", "AboutMe":"<p>Professional web developer.
