{"Body":"<p>There are many named concepts which relate to verbs across many languages.</p>\n\n<p>The three most well known would be <strong><em>tense</em></strong>, <strong><em>aspect</em></strong>, and <strong><em>mood</em></strong>.

I'm talking about what word to use in the sentence \"Aspect and mood are two XXX's of verbs\". What term belongs in the place of XXX?</p>\n\n<p>It's also possible that the same term might apply to concepts encoded in other parts of speech. For instance \"Number and case are two YYY's of nouns\"...</p>\n", "Id":"2020", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2021", "Title":"What's the best term for the group of concepts pertaining to verbs which includes tense, mood, and aspect?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-30T12:27:39.080", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><verbs><aspect><tense>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-30T19:32:11.663", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"124", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-02T07:24:17.733", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
