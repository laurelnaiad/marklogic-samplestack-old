{"Body":"<p>I'm looking for a program that will count information such as the most common terms in text, number of pronouns etc. I'm looking to input many song lyrics to see the most prevalent terms and the usage of pronouns and themes within each song for a sociolinguistic study. Does anyone know of any programs that can do this? I know of LIWC (Linguistic Enquiry &amp; Word Count) but I have never used it and am hoping for a good recommendation before I purchase one.</p>\n", "Id":"6034", "Title":"Corpus analysis program", "CreationDate":"2013-11-29T13:38:10.827", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"2773", "Tags":"<corpora><sociolinguistics>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"51", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-07T20:26:30.100", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2773", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a63b5665735ae1430cdba6da24264d5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"3631336", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"16", "CreationDate":"2013-11-24T14:11:58.570", "DisplayName":"noname", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-09T11:30:41.513", "AboutMe":""}}
