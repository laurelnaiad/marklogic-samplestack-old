{"Body":"<p>Some time ago I found two tables that reported the names for two fruits, which were supposed to be funny, because they specifically reported a single exception among those several languages, where this fruit's name was different for only one of those languages. </p>\n\n<p>I cropped the images to avoid space problems:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/TnUP4.jpg\" alt=\"the fruit that is ananas in many languages is pineapple in English only\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/47tWZ.jpg\" alt=\"the fruit that is banana in many languages is plátano in Spanish only\"></p>\n\n<p>They make one smile, but if we try to analyse the matter under a Linguistics point of view, it gets interesting, deserving to have a look into it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So my questions are</strong>: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why did two languages, English and Spanish, develop an alternative word to denote those fruits?</li>\n<li>And why did just one language (per case) behaved like this? I mean, why not also some other Romance language for one case or some other Germanic one for the other case?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>N.B.</strong> I just asked one question because I think these two occurrences are related, but if someone finds out they are two different linguistic phenomena, I can split them up. Also, feel free to retag, if necessary.</sup></p>\n", "Id":"690", "LastEditorUserId":"153", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Weird behavior of two fruits' names (ananas/pineapple, banana/plátano)", "CreationDate":"2011-10-04T15:49:05.357", "OwnerUserId":"111", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<language-change><evolution><cognates>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-05T06:31:50.360", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"47", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"153", "AccountId":"871764", "Views":"33", "Reputation":"1445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T03:14:58.320", "DisplayName":"Floating Tone", "LastAccessDate":"2012-05-27T05:07:04.410", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD candidate in linguistics, with diverse interests including phonetics, phonology, morphology, language documentation, historical linguistics and sociolinguistics.
