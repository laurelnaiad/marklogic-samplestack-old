{"Body":"<p>I'm considering the sentence</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some man and some woman visited a garden</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously it's not 100% unambiguous how many gardens there are, but I think most people would agree there is just one common garden.</p>\n\n<p>The sentence has the following formal grammar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[NP [NP Some man] and [NP some woman]] [VP visited [NP a garden]]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My problem is that since a VP has the type entity to truth value (E -> T) the only way I can think of interpreting it is <code>λv.∃x.garden(x)∧visit(v,x)</code>, however now how the only path I see forward leads me to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>∃a.man(a)∧(∃x.garden(x)∧visit(v,x)) ∧ ∃a.woman(b)∧(∃x.garden(x)∧visit(b,x))</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is exactly what we didn't want: that that the garden might be different persons.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, given the way the VP is interpreted, is there any way we can ever end up with the intended formula (below)?
