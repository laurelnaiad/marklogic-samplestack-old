{"Body":"<p>By making a quick comparison among several language phonologies (from various language families), I could observe that some phones occur very frequently, such as [m], [p], [b], [h], [a] and [i]. Others seem to be much rarer, among which, [ʕ], [ɰ], [ⱱ] and [ɪ̈].</p>\n\n<p>Do linguists know the frequency of each phone across languages? And, perhaps more importantly, why are some phones more frequent than others?</p>\n", "Id":"1224", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1228", "Title":"How are phones distributed across languages?", "CreationDate":"2012-01-04T00:38:38.473", "AnswerCount":"2", "Tags":"<phonetics><cross-linguistic>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"22", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"230", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-05T01:17:39.950", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
