{"Body":"<p>In his great answer to <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/1723/how-can-i-distinguish-modern-scandinavian-languages-at-a-glance\">this question</a>, the user <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/119/kaleissin\">kaleissin</a> alluded to something that I've been particularly interested in, so I want to turn it into a question of its own to all Norwegian and non-Norwegian contributors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(The dialect I speak most of the time uses</p>\n\n<pre><code>    å krype -  kryper   - krøyp       - har krypi\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Some might consider this to reveal my political stance :) )</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not so much interested in the sociolinguistic situation between written Bokmål and Nynorsk in general here (that has been described at length in the literature). My question is about casual spoken communication among Norwegians, especially among speakers of different local dialects.</p>\n\n<p>What is the exact sociolinguistic/political implication someone makes by using e.g. <code>har krypi</code> over a somewhat more standard form?</p>\n\n<p>How common and how \"politically charged\" is sticking to one's local dialect in spoken communication? Are there situations where someone might avoid a dialectal form of a participle e.g. in order to not make a political statement or maybe even come off as weird?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, is it common to approximate each other linguistically or even switch to a codified \"standard\" form other than for reasons of mutual intelligibility in Norwegian?</p>\n", "Id":"1727", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1729", "Title":"How does individual linguistic behavior relate to one's attitude of language politics in Norwegian?", "CreationDate":"2012-03-30T21:03:59.473", "OwnerUserId":"571", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<sociolinguistics><dialects><norwegian>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-30T21:09:42.070", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
