{"Body":"<p>I know that the two mentioned abilities are different. I always find it quite straightforward to understand a foreign language when reading. provided I have a good knowledge of its grammar and a large vocabulary. But when it comes to speaking it, so, to create a new, personal and creative content, I may experience an added difficulty. The words I look for in order to use them may not immediately come to mind, even though when I read them I don't have to think about their meaning.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there any psychological reason why is it less difficult to understand than to speak, even when the same vocabulary and rules are involved? </p>\n\n<p>Of course, I may be wrong in this claim.</p>\n", "Id":"3935", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"3940", "Title":"Why is it \"easier\" to understand a foreign language when reading than to speak it?", "CreationDate":"2013-06-30T13:22:17.853", "OwnerUserId":"1895", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<psycholinguistics>", "AnswerCount":"4", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-01T02:54:39.603", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"526", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-02T13:58:24.950", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"27", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1895", "AccountId":"2510358", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"202", "CreationDate":"2013-03-24T20:14:38.020", "DisplayName":"martina", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-10T09:04:37.563", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a PhD student (Physics, working on quantitative Linguistics).</p>\n"}}
