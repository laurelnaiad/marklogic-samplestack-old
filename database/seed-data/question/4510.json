{"Body":"<p>I've just learned that Lao has two words for \"to be\", that are mostly interchangeable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>ເປັນ</code> (pen)</li>\n<li><code>ແມ່ນ</code> (maen)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They both begin with a labial, have an \"e-like\" vowel, and end \"n\".</p>\n\n<p>I think it's pretty established that the \"b\", \"m\", and \"p\" sounds can be variants of each other in variants of the same word or in closely related words.</p>\n\n<p>The vowel in <code>ເປັນ</code> is an <code>/e/</code> but as fpr the vowel in <code>ແມ່ນ</code> I'm not sure if it's more like <code>/æ/</code> or <code>/ɛ/</code>, but I also believe that both of these can have close relationships with an <code>/e/</code> sound in a language.</p>\n\n<p>The Isan language, generally considered a dialect of Lao spoken in Thailand with a different set of recent influences and now written in the Thai script, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isan_language#Verbs\" rel=\"nofollow\">also has the two copulae</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are two copulas used in Isan, as in Lao, one for things relating to people, <code>เป็น</code> (pen, <code>/pen/</code>), and one for objects and animals, <code>แม่น</code> (maen, <code>/mɛːn/</code>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>I'm wondering if these two words that are similar in sound and similar in function are etymologically variants.</strong> I don't think Thai has two words and Zhuang seems to have an unrelated word as its copula: <code>dwg</code>.</p>\n", "Id":"4510", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"1", "Title":"Are the two Lao (and Isan) words for \"to be\", \"ເປັນ\" (pen) and \"ແມ່ນ\" (maen), etymologically related?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-20T07:00:57.810", "OwnerUserId":"51", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<etymology><verbs><synonymy><copula><lao>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-22T16:06:49.627", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"33", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-22T16:06:49.627", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}}
