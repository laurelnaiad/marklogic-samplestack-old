{"Body":"<p>I have texts in English and German containing \"dictionary words\" and names.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>e.g. \"... In Florence the painter Leonardo built ...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a Java program where need to determine for each word if it is a name or a word of the respective language.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>e.g. names={..., Florence, Leonardo, ...}, language words={..., In, the, painter, built, ...}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I see two approaches:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>use a respective dictionary list, load it into a hash structure, see if the word is in it (language word) or not (name / misspelled).</p>\n\n<p>Problems / Issues:</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't find a German word list where names are excluded</p>\n\n<p>word flexions (complicated in German) may not be in the list</p></li>\n<li><p>use a service / an api to translate single words into another language, see if the word is changed (language word) or not (name / misspelled).</p>\n\n<p>Problems / Issues:</p>\n\n<p>names may be translated as well, e.g. Florence > Florenz</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't find an offline dictionary list / api.
