{"Body":"<p>As I understand from the principles and parameters theory, all parameters are binary. In particular, the head directionality parameter can be set to either \"head-first\" or \"head-last\". The setting of one value or the other determines, among other things, which kind of adposition the language will have. Head-first generates prepositions (e.g. English). Head-last generates postpositions (e.g. Japanese). But Finnish is an example of language that has <em>both</em> prepositions and postpositions. What am I missing?</p>\n", "Id":"1007", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1010", "Title":"Head directionality parameter and adpositions in Finnish", "CreationDate":"2011-11-10T23:15:30.443", "AnswerCount":"3", "Tags":"<principles-and-parameters><finnish><adpositions>", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"22", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"244", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-11T05:49:33.097", "Score":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
