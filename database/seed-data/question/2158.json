{"Body":"<p>Among the descendants of the Latin word <em>sic</em> (\"thus, so, or just like that\"), only the Portuguese word <em>sim</em> ends with a nasal consonant. Actually, in modern Portuguese, it ends with a nasal vowel, [sĩ], which must have developed from [sim] by assimilation. Compare this with its \"sister\" words, taken from the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sic#Latin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiktionary</a>, which have all dropped the final [k]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Aromanian: shi</li>\n  <li>French: si, ainsi</li>\n  <li>Italian: sì, così</li>\n  <li>Romanian: și</li>\n  <li>Spanish: sí , así</li>\n  <li>Catalan: així</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The closest word is the French (no surprise, given we are talking about nasalization) <em>ainsi</em>, which comes from Latin (<em>ad</em>) + <em>in</em> + <em>sic</em>.\nSo where did this nasal at the end in Portuguese <em>sim</em> come from? Could it be a further development from French? Something like <em>ainsi</em> becoming <em>assim</em> (and later, <em>sim</em>), by metathesis?</p>\n", "Id":"2158", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"Where did the nasal sound in the Portuguese word \"sim\" come from?", "CreationDate":"2012-06-21T14:15:28.387", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><historical-linguistics><romance-languages><portuguese>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-22T07:31:07.237", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"352", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-05T19:19:53.060", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
