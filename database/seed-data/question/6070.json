{"Body":"<p>We were given some data and the questions below. I don't need someone to tell me the answer, I just need someone to help explain what X after X construction is.

Jackendoff presents one analysis where the first N is the head, and the rest is its complement. He ultimately favors an analysis where this is a strange sort of PP, though, with the P as its head. You should present possible trees of each of these types and choose one.  </p>\n", "Id":"6070", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "Title":"X after X construction?", "CreationDate":"2013-12-05T05:09:23.690", "OwnerUserId":"2820", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><x-bar-theory>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-06T03:01:54.670", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"40", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-06T03:01:54.670", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/915374e74455a550076ce33125a43789?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "Id":"2820", "AccountId":"3684725", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-12-05T05:09:23.690", "DisplayName":"user2820", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-05T11:07:54.017"}}
