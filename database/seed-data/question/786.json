{"Body":"<p>It seems that there is a consensus that the PIE roots for <em>ten</em> and <em>hundred</em> are, respectively, <em>*deḱṃ</em> and <em>*ḱṃtóm</em>. There also seems to be a consensus that <em>*ḱṃtóm</em> is a shortened version of <em>*deḱṃtóm</em>. These two roots are strongly related, both morphologically (sharing the syllable *<em>-ḱm-</em>) and semantically (a hundred is ten times ten). But what exactly is the nature of this relationship? Researching the subject, I have found some accounts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://books.google.com.br/books?id=YLJb6-OyUIQC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menninger, 1992</a></strong>: <em>*(d)ḱṃtóm</em> was formed by appending the syllable *<em>-to-</em> to the root <em>*deḱṃ</em>, which turned the number ten into a noun (something like \"ten-ness\"). In other words, the Proto-Indo-European speakers conceived a hundred essentially as a ten-ness (of tens).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691058873\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anthony, 2007</a></strong>: <em>*ḱṃtóm</em> means (a unit of) tens. So, the combination of these two morphemes (*<em>deḱṃ</em> + *<em>ḱṃtóm</em>), meaning \"ten units of ten\", would have given rise to <em>*(de)ḱṃtóm</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://indo-european.info/a-grammar-of-modern-indo-european-third-edition.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quiles and López-Menchero, 2011</a></strong>: The tens were normally formed with the units followed by the suffix *<em>-dḱṃta</em> (\"group of ten\"). For example, thirty is <em>*trídḱṃta</em> (*<em>tri</em> + *<em>-dḱṃta</em>). According to this analysis, the word for hundred was formed by *<em>deḱṃ</em> + *<em>-dḱṃta</em>, which somehow produced the word <em>*(d)ḱṃtóm</em>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These three explanations are very similar, but they also seem to be slightly different from each other. Are they really different or (what is probably the case) am I missing the big picture here?</p>\n", "Id":"786", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "FavoriteCount":"1", "AcceptedAnswerId":"1728", "Title":"What is the relationship between the PIE roots *dekṃ and *kṃtóm?", "CreationDate":"2011-10-12T18:10:48.663", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<historical-linguistics><proto-indo-european><numbers><roots>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-07-16T10:25:06.747", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "ViewCount":"351", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-16T10:25:06.747", "Score":"14", "CommentCount":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
