{"Body":"<p>I am specifically asking about the dialects of Irish spoken in Connemara that have a tendency for a \"slender\" r with a distinct buzzing. Some friends and I have been discussing this topic on the <a href=\"http://irishlearner.awyr.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=2740\" rel=\"nofollow\">Irish Language Learner's forum</a> and we cannot come to a consensus. I believe that it might be [ɾ̝ʲ]. The sounds has the teeth closed so that it has the buzzing quality of /ʒ/ but has the lamina raised and tapping the tooth ridge - unlike /ʒ/ which has the posterodorsal part of the tongue bunched up.</p>\n\n<p>Here are examples on Forvo of the sound in question. If there are multiple pronunciations take user <a href=\"http://www.forvo.com/user/BridEilis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BridEilis</a> as the example.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.forvo.com/word/socair/#ga\" rel=\"nofollow\">socair</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.forvo.com/word/iomair/#ga\" rel=\"nofollow\">iomair</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tomás de Bhaldraithe's description in <em>The Irish of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaeltacht_Cois_Fharraige\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cois Fhairrge</a>, Co. Galway - A Phonetic Study</em> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>223.</code> <strong>r'</strong> represents a voiced palatized flapped alveolar sound. The tip of the tongue makes one tap against the front part of the\n  teeth-ridge. The sounds strikes the ear as somewhat similar to a short\n  voiced palatized alveolar plosive. <strong>When in final position, the\n  contact is released very slowly so that a slight affrication is\n  heard.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The  emphasis on the final sentence is mine as this is the specific sound I am asking about. Here is an image of what I believe the IPA might be.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/GsCQ5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n", "Id":"6433", "LastEditorUserId":"828", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"IPA for Slender Irish /r'/ in Connemara Dialects", "CreationDate":"2014-01-16T19:27:17.767", "OwnerUserId":"828", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonology><phonemes><ipa><irish>", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-17T01:50:20.217", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"22", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ElementalSQL.com/", "Id":"828", "AccountId":"130858", "CreationDate":"2012-03-09T18:54:37.047", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a database administrator and SharePoint developer/administrator.
