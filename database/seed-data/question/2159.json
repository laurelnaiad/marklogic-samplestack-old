{"Body":"<p>I've been working on <em>document level sentiment analysis</em> over the last year. Document level sentiment analysis provides the sentiment of the complete document. For example - The text \"<em>Nokia is good but vodafone sucks big time</em>\" would have a negative polarity associated with it as it would be agnostic to the entities Nokia and Vodafone. </p>\n\n<p>How would it be possible to get entity level sentiment, like positive for Nokia but negative for Vodafone? Are there any research papers providing a solution to such problems ?</p>\n", "Id":"2159", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "FavoriteCount":"2", "Title":"Entity level Sentiment Analysis", "CreationDate":"2012-06-21T15:08:44.380", "OwnerUserId":"1124", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<computational-linguistics><nlp><named-entity-recognition>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-21T16:35:57.073", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
