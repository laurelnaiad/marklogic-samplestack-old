{"Body":"<p>Are “go” and “went” part of the same lexeme, i.e. the same set of inflected forms?</p>\n\n<p>Consider this brief <a href=\"http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Lexeme_%28i.e._a_set_of_word-forms%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glottopedia entry</a>. The entry defines its subject matter as follows:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“A lexeme is usually defined as a set of inflected word-forms that differ only in their inflectional properties.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The entry also provides these examples:    </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The English word-forms boy and boys make up the lexeme BOY. The Latin word-forms habeo 'I have', habes  'you have', habet ' s/he has', habemus  'we have', habebam  'I had', habebunt  'they will have', and so on make up the lexeme HABERE.”   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But can “went” really be described as part of a set of <em>inflected</em> word forms in the lexeme that also includes “go,” “goes,” and “going”?   If so, how is “went” inflected?</p>\n\n<p>Or am I confusing “inflections” with “inflectional properties”?    (I don’t know whether there is a distinction between these terms or not).   Could “went” have “inflectional properties”  that make it part of the lexeme “GO” even if \"went\" can’t be described morphologically as being inflected?   </p>\n", "Id":"4521", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "FavoriteCount":"2", "AcceptedAnswerId":"4522", "Title":"Are \"go\" and \"went\" part of the same lexeme?", "CreationDate":"2013-09-21T18:06:22.737", "OwnerUserId":"790", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<terminology><morphology><suppletion><lexemes>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-09T19:07:16.557", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"206", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-09T19:07:16.557", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"468", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"790", "AccountId":"1271332", "Views":"40", "Reputation":"2834", "CreationDate":"2012-02-23T05:08:22.933", "DisplayName":"James Grossmann", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T00:13:57.030", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a conlanger who needs reliable information about real languages.
