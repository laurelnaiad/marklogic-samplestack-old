{"Body":"<p><strong>Does there exist a scale by which languages might be rated for their ability to let the user easily or concisely express concepts?</strong> I am not a professional linguist, but I do find that some languages, such a Hebrew, make it more difficult to express certain subjects than do other languages. Other languages, such as Russian, make it easy to unambiguously express or confer complex ideas, even concisely. I've heard that Swahili is an inherently simple language in which one <em>cannot</em> express many complex (not necessarily modern) concepts, such an example would rate low on this scale.</p>\n", "Id":"3987", "Title":"Does there exist a rating scale for the \"conferability\" of languages?", "CreationDate":"2013-07-10T11:56:49.700", "AnswerCount":"1", "PostTypeId":"1", "OwnerUserId":"536", "Tags":"<terminology>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"51", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-10T15:59:33.473", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
