{"Body":"<p>I happen to be aware that \"goodbye\" or \"bye bye\" derives from \"May God be with you\". However, most English speakers that I have asked seem to not know this. When asked \"What does 'bye bye' mean?\" they will not know. It seems that the word \"bye\", due to being used in no other context in English, is a sort of nonsense word that people use out of habit with no ulterior intention or expression of meaning. Contrast this with Russian, Hebrew, or other languages in which the greetings and partings are words or phrases with real meanings, such as \"peace [to you]\".</p>\n\n<p>How is it that some languages or cultures will accept words for greetings and partings that have no obvious meaning? Is the usage of these words simply learned from the surroundings with no questions asked as to the meanings? Are there other words that people use in which they do not know the meaning?</p>\n", "Id":"2029", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2031", "Title":"How are words with no other context used as greetings or partings?", "CreationDate":"2012-05-31T13:00:21.363", "OwnerUserId":"536", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<interjections>", "AnswerCount":"1", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-01T04:15:14.240", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "ViewCount":"152", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-01T04:15:14.240", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
