{"Body":"<p>Memorizing IPA consonants is trivially easy; each symbol represents one sound, and that sound can be described with a variety of parameters about manner of articulation, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The IPA vowels, however, are a whole other beast. How can they be memorized if describing them is not so easy? Of course, some symbols are just English vowels, which makes them pretty self-explanatory, but other ones like the back medium vowels are a bit trickier. Is there any method to the madness?</p>\n", "Id":"2376", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "AcceptedAnswerId":"2384", "Title":"How can the IPA vowels be memorized?", "CreationDate":"2012-08-06T21:10:45.577", "OwnerUserId":"958", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<phonetics><ipa><vowels>", "AnswerCount":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-07T20:15:24.123", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
