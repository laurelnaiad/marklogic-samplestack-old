{"Body":"<p>I just ran into this in the novel \"Pride and Prejudice\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>-\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\n  -\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.''\n  -``<em>It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.</em>''</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The occurrence of \"such\" here is interesting to me. Is it a pronoun here which is brought instead of \"young men of four thousand a year\"?</li>\n<li>What is the deep structure of the noun phrase of the if-clause? the surface structure is \"twenty such\". Is the deep structure \"twenty young men who are of 4 thousand a year\"?</li>\n<li>When a Reduction Transformation is possible which is better to be used? for example, is it better to say \"a man who is of large fortune\" or \"a man of large fortune\"? Any links elaborating on the Reduction Transformations in English would be truly appreciated. As far as I know, there are six RTs. But I need a trustworthy reference for my further studying.</li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"6244", "Title":"“Such” as a pronoun and “Reduction Transformations”", "CreationDate":"2013-12-24T09:59:52.123", "OwnerUserId":"2925", "PostTypeId":"1", "Tags":"<grammar><pronoun><universal-grammar><transformations>", "comments":[], "ViewCount":"42", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-24T09:59:52.123", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2340b19d3a802135ba7c48bb8acae277?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2925", "AccountId":"2743901", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "CreationDate":"2013-12-24T09:57:23.707", "DisplayName":"Juya", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-25T06:27:22.510", "AboutMe":"<p>A modest English learner who seeks to improve his English:)</p>\n", "Age":"26"}}
