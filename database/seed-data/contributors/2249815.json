As I am still young I will strive to learn everything in my field in the domain of computers. I will eliminate the thought (or regret) that I was born a right-side thinker and mould my mind into one that thinks through abstraction and numbers rather than anesthetic beauty and spirituality.</p>\n\n<p>I wont win a Turing Award or solve the P = NP problem within my life but that is understandable :p</p>\n\n<p>I am involved in several groups with real developers on Meetup.com and am happy that I can help work on shared projects despite how little I can contribute.</p>\n", "websiteUrl":null, "location":null}
