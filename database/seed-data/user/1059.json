I'd also like to explore Smalltalk, Go, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, OCaml, and maybe even C#.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not currently a programmer by trade, but I'd like to get into it. I do write a lot of scripts to help me in my job.</p>\n\n<p>My day-to-day personal computing setup is in Mac OS X, but I also use a Linux desktop as a backup server and for general tinkering; and I use Windows 7 at work.</p>\n\n<p>I am also deeply interested (albeit at an amateur remove) in linguistics, especially historical. This dovetails with the fact that I am a conlanger -- someone who creates languages. (I'm not especially prolific at that, though.)</p>\n\n<p>I also like science (especially cognitive science, evolution, and physics) and anthropology. My overarching interest in all these areas is the way something like a genome or language or computer language or culture changes over time and forks into unnumerable new ones.</p>\n", "Age":"36", "Location":"Wisconsin", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"echristopherson", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-18T23:41:13.937"}
