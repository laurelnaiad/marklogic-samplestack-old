I am also a Senior Java Developer (with well over ten years behind me). I am into source control management, tooling, continuous integration, research and development and other odd things most developers wouldn't want to get into. :)</p>\n\n<p>I am active in the Open Source community, by hosting several of my own projects, as well as discussing or contributing fixes for various OSS projects. I believe in OSS and that contributing to the online society via either free tools or advice on various problems will not only strengthen one's own knowledge, but also help others advance as well.</p>\n", "Age":"32", "Location":"London, UK", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"101", "DisplayName":"carlspring", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-19T10:13:55.720"}
