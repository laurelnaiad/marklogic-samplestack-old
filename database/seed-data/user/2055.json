Programming, mostly in C, and helping are sort of obsessions for me. I'll rarely settle with anything less than the most portable, standard-compliant solution possible.</p>\n\n<p>I joined this community around the same time I was banned from codecall, and am most grateful to it for reassuring me that I'm on the correct path; Where others have described me as aggressive, people here seem to recognise my rigid honesty. It's nice to see to see my reputation points reflecting that I am indeed helping people.</p>\n"}
