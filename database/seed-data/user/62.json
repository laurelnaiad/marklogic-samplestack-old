In my spare time I enjoy travelling, computer programming, geocaching, bad puns, obscure board game variants, urban farming, and all kinds of food.</p>\n", "Age":"25", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"470", "DisplayName":"tdhsmith", "LastAccessDate":"2012-09-04T04:59:08.823"}
