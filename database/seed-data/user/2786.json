I try to keep the information global and using an appropriate langage in relation to the asker(s) aptitude and position. I try to find the behind-the-appearance real cause for a failure/breach/suspicious activity.</p>\n\n<p>In programming, I place portability above all, having to use very old systems where GNU niceties and \"common\" taken-for-granted features are absent (ex: tar's removal of the leading \"/\" when extracting files...). I prefer simple to read answers to clever one-liners, especially when the asker seems a beginner.</p>\n\n<p>In Photography, I try to keep it as close to the subject as possible (spontaneous portraits, lack of (or very minimal) editing), and trying to get a global view of the field to find interresting solutions to everyday situations.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n"}
