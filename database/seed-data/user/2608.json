I'm now at FGCU studying Mandarin Chinese and Spanish, and will be transferring to UGA next year to pursue an undergraduate degree in linguistics.  I hope to one professor in Historical Linguistics.  </p>\n\n<p>My particular interests within this field include phonetics, historical linguistics, linguistic relativism, and many other things.  </p>\n\n<p>I have studied to some extent the following languages (in order of fluency): </p>\n\n<pre><code>* English\n* Spanish\n* German\n* French\n* Mandarin Chinese\n* Esperanto\n* Latin\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can read and write in the following scripts (in order of literacy): </p>\n\n<pre><code> * Latin\n * My personal set of runes (I call them the \"Milic Futhark\"; I read them as well as Latin)\n * Elder Futhark\n * Anglo-Saxon Futhorc (first second alphabet, before 6th grade)\n * Greek\n * Cyrillic (I actually learned this before Greek, and it made Greek very easy :p )\n * Hebrew (I only know a few of the letters)\n * Simplified Chinese (learning it in school :) )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Plus a bunch of random orthographies using Latin :p .</p>\n", "Age":"20", "Location":"Naples, Florida", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "DisplayName":"Maiyli78", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-10T18:15:34.807"}
