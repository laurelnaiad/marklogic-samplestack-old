I took a Visual Basic elective this semester to learn what it is, what is is about, and what can be done with it. I'm thinking about making a game Summer 2012 using Visual Basic. I'm not a programmer but it would be nice to one day say I know how to program, especially if I can program a robot. </p>\n\n<p>In Fall 2012, I may be starting on a Master's Degree in Business and Information Systems. I enjoy many subjects including medicine, computers, foreign affairs, military history, etc. I've considered being a medical doctor. At the very least I plan to earn my PhD within the next 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy video games, movies, and learning new languages (computer and spoken). As I've stated before, I'm learning Visual Basic right now along with Java. Spoken languages learning right now are: Russian, Tagalog, Mandarin, Japanese and Korean but I will soon be focusing on only two for native fluency. I'm okay with being conversational or just understanding the other languages.</p>\n", "Age":"29", "Location":"New Jersey", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"1", "DisplayName":"fragilewindows", "LastAccessDate":"2012-05-30T15:40:28.260"}
