I've programmed all kinds of languages since 1983, but as yet I have limited experience with Objective C, Cocoa, and XCode. </p>\n\n<p>Two medium-skill apps released so far, and I feel I'm at the level where I can code and debug anything on the iPhone and understand the workings except in some rare cases. I can still feel baffled and stifled when implementing new framework features, but usually have no problem getting them going with some reading up.</p>\n\n<p>It's still a long distance till I feel quite at home with it all, but I've come a ways.</p>\n", "Age":"43"}
