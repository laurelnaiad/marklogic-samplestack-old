My current focuses are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>Italian and German for the best possible score in my high school studies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I love Linguistics and Maths too, however I'm more passionate about the former. I guess you could also say I enjoy computer programming, however again I'm not the biggest enthusiast.</p>\n", "Age":"17", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"121", "DisplayName":"Ledda", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T22:16:36.293"}
