Although most of my work is aimed at solving organizational problems, one of my pet interests is how pre-training could increase the number of competent (say, 3/3) linguists graduating from foreign language programs. I think pre-selection for these programs has gone as far as it can go, and now we need to look at pre-training. US Navy SEALs increased their yield from about 15% to 25% with pre-training.</p>\n", "Age":"64", "Location":"Denver, CO", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"6", "DisplayName":"Bill Casey", "LastAccessDate":"2012-06-14T14:24:11.370"}
