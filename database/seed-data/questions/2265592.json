  "body": "\n\nI'm using the .net TimeZoneInfo FindSystemTimeZoneById method which I understand queries the registry. Are the values for Time Zone ID strings stored in the registry  at \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Time Zone\" dependent on the language of the Windows installation of the machine? \n\nThe registry key contains a value called \"Display Name\" so it would make sense for this to be the language specific one, but I can't find out if this is the case (short of installing a different language version of Windows). Can anybody let me know?",
