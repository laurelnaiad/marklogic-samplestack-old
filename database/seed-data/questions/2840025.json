  "body": "\n\nSo, in our website we are using `SiteMap`. For each request we render some menu and to do that we do `SiteMap.RootNode` in the helper function. \n\nNow, when I have done the profiling of my website using **dotTrace**, I saw the `get_RootNode()` is taking lot's of time(around 70-75 millisecond). But we know that the `SiteMap` is static. So, I am thinking in somehow I will get the `SiteMap.RootNode` only once in `Application_Start` and will access that through out each request.\n\nSo, my questions are,\n\nIs my approach correct? \nHow should I do that?\nOr is there any efficient way that I can use `SiteMap.RootNode`\n\nThanks.",
