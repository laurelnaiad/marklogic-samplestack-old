This allows us to add simple controls to a form without having to recompile the application.\n\nI was wondering if it was possible to set a component's property based on a property name contained in a string so we could set further options.\n\nPseudo-code:\n\n\tComp := TButton.Create(Self);\n\t\n\t// Something like this:\n\tComp.GetProperty('Left').AsInteger := 100;\n\t// Or this:\n\tComp.SetProperty('Left', 100);\n\t\n\nIs this possible at all?
