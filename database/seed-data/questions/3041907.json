I'd like to make it convenient for them and want to import certain packages by default, when groovysh starts up so that users would not have to re-type the same imports every time they start the shell. Does anyone know how to accomplish this?\n\nThanks in advance,\nigor", "lastActivityDate":"2010-06-15T00:50:44.250", "title":"How to add imports to groovysh on startup?", "tags":[["groovy"], ["groovyshell"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201006", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
