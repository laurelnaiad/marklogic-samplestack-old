The .pow() method does what I want, but takes an int value as an argument.  The .modPow method takes a BigInteger as an argument, but I do not want an answer congruent to  the value I'm trying to compute.\n\nMy BigInteger exponent is too large to be represented as an int, can someone suggest a way to work around this limitation?", "lastActivityDate":"2011-10-27T17:28:15.020", "title":"How do you raise a Java BigInteger to the power of a BigInteger without doing modular arithmetic?", "tags":[["java"], ["biginteger"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201005", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
