I know that if a class exists as a resource then you can use an input stream to load the class in binary format but how can I go about this if the class is generated at runtime?", "lastActivityDate":"2010-05-21T05:58:39.817", "title":"Get bytes for a class that was generated at runtime", "tags":[["java"], ["class-loading"], ["classloader"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201001", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
