  "body": "\n\nI have a class of library code which uses a System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser control to load a web page then extract information from the DOM tree, etc... I've found this to be the only reliable way to be able to parse information loaded onto a page with javascript, etc...\n\nThis worked fine when testing with console app, but when I call the same method from an asp.net page (ASP.NET MVC Controller) it crashes with a \"ActiveX control '8856f961-340a-11d0-a96b-00c04fd705a2' cannot be instantiated because the current thread is not in a single-threaded apartment.\"... i've tried adding [STAThread] to my method but that doesn't seem to help!\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nUpdate:\n\nI need to allow a page to complete load and execute all its javascript, then search it for text that matches a template I have already stored... Don't think HtmlAgilityPack will work?  Does WatIn run the javascript?",
