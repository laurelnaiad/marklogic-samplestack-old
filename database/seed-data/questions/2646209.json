What I had in mind was a back-end page that has thumbnail images to the left, and an image upload panel to the right. When an image gets uploaded, the thumbnails in the left gets updated. I also need a delete function on all of the thumbnails; maybe when they hover over an image, an \"x\" could appear, which when clicked, will delete the image. I'll also need dragging capabilities so that the user can rearrange the ordering of the images. \n\nI was hoping for all this to be using javascript and ajax. I think it should be possible because I can find each piece from separate plugins, but I want one that encapsulates all of them together.", "lastActivityDate":"2011-12-02T07:05:04.613", "title":"Ajax Image Gallery Uploader", "tags":[["javascript"], ["html"], ["ajax"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201004", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
