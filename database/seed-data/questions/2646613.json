  "body": "\n\nI'm using [JSON.simple](http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/) to generate JSON output from Java.  But every time I call jsonobj.put(\"this\", \"that\"), I see a warning in Eclipse:\n\n> Type safety: The method put(Object, Object) belongs to the raw type HashMap. References to generic type HashMap should be parameterized\n\nThe clean fix would be if JSONObject were genericized, but since it isn't, I can't add any generic type parameters to fix this. I'd like to switch off as few warnings as possible, so adding \"@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\" to lots of methods is unappealing, but do I have any other option besides putting up with the warnings?",
