This API is currently being used by an iPhone app to do CRUD operations.\n\nMy question is, can I design a web client that uses this REST API using nothing more than ExtJS (or some other RIA framework) and HTML pages? In other words, can I create a static HTML page that uses ExtJS to send AJAX calls to the REST API and receive JSON data from it? Or is this thinking too naive and wrong?",
