  "body": "\n\nHi\nIs there a way to decompile the binary from an IPhone app.\nI jailbroke my IPhone and was surprised to find other app's dbs wide open to be copied.\nSo I exported my most important table and hardcoded it into code.\nInstead of loading table into array from a db I just generated code to fill the array and kept only the most basic DB info so relationships still work.\nTook a while but now works fine.\n\nI was just wondering am I safe, could someone decompile the binary for the app easily and extract the data. In Java its easy to decompile *.class files though thats bytecode  where I presume iphone apps are more low level.\n\nI know IPhone sdk 4 can mark files as secure. Anyone know can this be overridden by jailbreaks or is this an unix lock?",
