  "body": "\n\nI'm stuck and I'd appreciate your opinions on the subject. I want to implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` for my entities. I can't figure out which way is the best and why. The only obvious difference to me is that AoP is a little faster since everything gets done at compile-time while using IoC/DI it's easier to change behaviors latter. So which one would you actually use (or have used in the past) and why?\n\nThank you.\n\n*Please rephrase my question, I am not a native speaker*",
