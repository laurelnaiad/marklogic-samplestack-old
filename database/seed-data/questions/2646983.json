{"id":"/questions//questions/2646983.json.json", "creationDate":"2010-04-15T16:07:22.733", "body":"\n\nI am little stumped: I have a simple messenger client program (pure python, sockets), and I wanted to add proxy support (http/s, socks), however I am a little confused on how to go about it. I am assuming that the connection on the socket level will be done to the proxy server, at which point the headers should contain a CONNECT + destination IP (of the chat server) and authentication, (if proxy requires so), however the rest is a little beyond me. How is the subsequent connection handled, specifically the reading/writing, etc...\n\nAre there any guides on proxy support implementation for socket based (tcp) programming in Python?\n\nThank you", "lastActivityDate":"2010-04-26T15:16:40.697", "title":"Python, implementing proxy support for a socket based application (not urllib2)", "tags":[["python"], ["proxy"], ["tcp"], ["sockets"], ["socks"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201004", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
