  "body": "\n\nI have a server and a client written in C. I try to load a shared library in the server and then pass library function pointers to the client. This way I can change the library without have to compile the client.\n\nBecause of every process has its own separate memory space, I wonder if it is possible to load a shared library on a shared memory, pass the function pointers and map the shared memory on the client and then make the client execute the code of the library loaded by the server.",
