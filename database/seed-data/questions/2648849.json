If I define a DynamicResource, I realise that an expression is created (where?) that is not translated into a resource until runtime, however, What I do not understans is whether this dynamicresouce, once built, is now \"Static\"\n\nFor instance, if I create a context menu via a dynamicresource, are the menuitems which are created at runtime on access then static, even if they are bound?\n\nIf so, how can i create a dynamic context menu in XAML?",
