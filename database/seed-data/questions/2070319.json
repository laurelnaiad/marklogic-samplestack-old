I'm iterating a subset of items from a collection. I filter this collection using a Linq query. It basically looks like this:\n\n\tvar filteredItems = items.Where(x => x.PropertyToFilterOn == filterValue);\n\tforeach (var filteredItem in filteredItems)\n\t{\n\t    // do something to the filtered item\n\t}\n\t\n\nIf I use `Select` instead of `Where` I achieve the same thing. Which is better to use and what is the difference?", "lastActivityDate":"2010-01-15T08:47:46.133", "title":"Is Linq \"Where\" more expensive than Linq \"Select\"?", "tags":[["c#"], ["linq"], ["performance"], ["select"], ["collections"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201001", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
