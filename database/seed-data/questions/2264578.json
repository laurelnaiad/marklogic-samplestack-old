  "body": "\n\nI just came across a situation: I was debugging a thread which iterates through a large amount of data. I was using Debug.WriteLine to print which record is being processed. What just happened is that thread has reported that it has processed all records, however, Visual Studio's debug window is still displaying out. I am positive that thread has completed its job.\n\nIs Debug.WriteLine Async or data has been stacked in Visual Studio's buffer and is getting displayed slowly?",
