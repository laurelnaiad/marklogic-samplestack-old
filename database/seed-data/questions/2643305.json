There is no div used, this is the [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) style:\n\n\tbody{\n\t    background-position:center;\n\t    background-image:url(../images/images2.jpg) no-repeat;\n\t}\n\t\n\nThe above CSS tiles all over and does center it, but half the image is not seen, it just kind of moves up. What I want to do is center the image. Could I adopt the image to view even on a 21\" screen?",
