Something along the lines of:\n\n`gbus.connect('engine-started', myCallback)`\n\nOf course `gbus` here is just an example.", "lastActivityDate":"2010-01-16T01:57:25.783", "title":"Connecting signals in GTK+: anonymous way?", "tags":[["python"], ["gtk+"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201001", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
