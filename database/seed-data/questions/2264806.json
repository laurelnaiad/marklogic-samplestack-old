I can understand why that would be easier than parsing YouTube comments.\n\nMy question is: given a random piece of text, is there a process to determine whether that text is well written, and is a good candidate for use in NLP? What is the general name for these algorithm?\n\nI would appreciate links to articles, algorithms or code libraries, but I would settle for good search terms.", "lastActivityDate":"2010-02-28T03:09:04.440", "title":"How to automatically determine text quality?", "tags":[["nlp"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201002", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
