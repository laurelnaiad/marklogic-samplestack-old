This way:\n\n\t(4..0).each do |i|\n\t  puts i\n\tend\n\t==> 4..0\n\t\n\nIteration through 0..4 writes the numbers. On the other Range r = 4..0 seems to be ok, r.first == 4, r.last == 0. Seems to be strange to me that the construct above does not produce the expected result. What is the a reason for that? What are the situations when this behaviour is reasonable?", "lastActivityDate":"2014-01-13T20:17:03.793", "title":"Is there a reason that we cannot iterate on \"reverse Range\" in ruby?", "tags":[["ruby"], ["iteration"], ["range"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201001", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
