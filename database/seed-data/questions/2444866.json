  "body": "\n\nMost of the time I don't want to render a layout when the request comes from AJAX. To this end I've been writing `render :layout => !request.xhr?` frequently in my controller actions.\n\nHow can I make this the *default*? I.e., I'd like to be able to write\n\n\tdef new\n\t  Post.find(params[:id])\n\tend\n\t\n\nand have the functionality be\n\n\tdef show\n\t  Post.find(params[:id])\n\t  render :layout => !request.xhr?\n\tend\n\t\n\n(I'm fine manually specifying a layout in the rare cases in which I want to use one.)",
