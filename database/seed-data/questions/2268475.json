So this way I 'always' have an up-to-date version of the table.\n\nI looked into `RowSetListener`, but these events seem to get invoked only if I make modifications to the `RowSet` directly. It would be enough to know that there was a change, I know... that's a lot :)\n\nPlease share your thoughts! Thanks in advance!\nDaniel",
