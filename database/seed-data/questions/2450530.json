  "body": "\n\nHi I have 1000 encrypted workbooks which I would like to decrypt by providing a pwd.\nI could not find a decrypt method under apache poi or python's xlrd module.\n\nDoes anyone know a library which could handle this (`wbc.decrypt(pwd)`). I would prefer a lib i could you use from a unix box.\n\nThanks",
