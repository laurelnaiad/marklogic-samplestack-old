A nice debugger that allows me to easily view variable values if I use breakpoints. \n\n2. Works very nicely in Windows 7. \n\n3. Has something *similar* to the Toolbox pane in Visual Studio.\n\n4. Built in intellisense, and code completion with the TAB key. \n\n5. Long term support. I mean something that will last and stay in active development for years. I don't want a pet project IDE that will stop developing in a year. I'm just learning so it'll be very dificult at first to switch IDE's.\n\nI'm new so I don't really know which IDE provides what I need between the two.
