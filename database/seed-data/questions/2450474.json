When you mouseover the names of the suites, it should show a description by removing an 'active' class and applying it to the corresponding div, with the stylesheet setting display:none to inactive divs and display:block to actives.  The same method is being applied to the images and that works fine though.  Any help on this issue would be much appreciated!", "lastActivityDate":"2012-06-11T16:33:42.693", "title":"IE7 issue w/ jQuery site feature", "tags":[["jquery"], ["html"], ["internet-explorer-7"], ["css-float"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201003", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
