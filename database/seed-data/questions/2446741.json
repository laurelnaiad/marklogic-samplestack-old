I figure this means I can control the Low values myself or at least fetch the next Low value from somewhere.\n\nThe reason I want to use this is that I want to set relations to other entities I'm about to insert. They do not exist yet but will be inserted before the batch transaction completes.\n\nHowever, I cannot find information about how to set the Low values or how to get what Low value is up next.\n\nAny ideas?", "lastActivityDate":"2010-04-07T08:09:41.527", "title":"HiLo: how to control Low values", "tags":[["nhibernate"], ["s#arp-architecture"], ["hilo"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201003", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
