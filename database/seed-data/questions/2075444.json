I'm trying to insert the userName variable into a string and then use that as the url, so something's not right in my NSURL declaration.\n\nThanks for your help!", "lastActivityDate":"2013-04-17T19:25:00.037", "title":"Setting an NSURL with %@ making value equal to %@ instead of inserting %@", "tags":[["iphone"], ["nsurl"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201001", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
