  "body": "\n\nI have a list of items that the user can select. I want it to be more user friendly than standard checkboxes so I have seperate div's each with a unique id.\n\nWhen user clicks an item, I use javascript to display a tick on top of that item and change the style to show that it is highlighted.\n\nIm trying to work out how I can pass the list of id's when the form is submitted. Remember, if the user unticks an item, it should be removed from the list, I was thinking of using comma seperated values in a hidden text field but couldnt work out how to remove items from the start of the list if they were deselected",
