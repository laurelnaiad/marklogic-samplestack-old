However, if you are stuck with a non-functional language, say C#, what techniques are there to avoid for-loops or to get rid of them by refactoring? With lambda expressions and LINQ perhaps? If so, how?\n\n**Questions**\n\nSo the question boils down to:\n1. Why are for-loops bad? Or, in what context are for-loops to avoid and why?\n2. Can you provide C# code examples of how it looks before, i.e. with a loop, and afterwards without a loop?", "lastActivityDate":"2010-04-16T01:46:48.927", "title":"How to replace for-loops with a functional statement in C#?", "tags":[["c#"], ["linq"], ["functional-programming"], ["lambda"], ["for-loop"]], "docScore":0, "comments":[], "answers":[], "creationYearMonth":"201004", "itemTally":0, "owner":null}
