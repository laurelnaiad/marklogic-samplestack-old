I am currently using this code:\n\n\t        objGraphics.Clear(SystemColors.Control);\n\t\n\nWhat I want to do is Clear this object to black (or some other RGB color), and I'm stumped as to how to replace the SystemColors.Control with, preferably, an RGB color spec.  I'd probably want to clear to black most of the time.
