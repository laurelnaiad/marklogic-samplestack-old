I recently <a href=\"http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/2707/why-is-indirect-speech-marked-by-modus-instead-of-tempus-in-german/\">asked on GLU</a>, why German prescribes the use of <em>modus</em> instead of <em>tempus</em> for marking indirect speech. So this is one important difference vs. most other languages using tempus or no marking at all for indirect speech. Being a german native speaker and having <em>Latinum</em>, I never heard ther term <em>Subjunktiv</em> in a language course. So hippietrail is imo right here, it doesn't exist in German.</p>\n", "Id":"915", "ParentId":"906", "CreationDate":"2011-10-30T14:44:09.900", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"192", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-30T14:44:09.900", "CommentCount":"5"}
