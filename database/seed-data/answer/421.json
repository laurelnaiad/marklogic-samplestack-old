{"Body":"<p>Instead of talking about words falling out of use, how about we talk about \"cognate replacement\" (there's a good search term for you).  So, in English, we say <em>to walk</em> and in Italian they say <em>ambulare</em>. These two words have very different histories, so we'd call them different cognates. In English, we have a less commonly used verb <em>to ambulate</em>, which is cognate with Italian <em>ambulare</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, let's take two more closely related languages, Italian and French. Italian's word for \"to walk\" is <em>ambulare</em>, and in French it's <em>marcher</em>. These two language are both descendent from Latin, which used <em>ambulare</em> for \"to walk\". So at some point, French replaced its word for \"to walk\" with another, historically unrelated word.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not this kind of cognate replacement happens at a constant rate is, I think, a rather controversial question in Historical Linguistics. It is at least as controversial as whether or not genetic mutations happen at a constant rate.  There is at least one paper which argues that frequent words undergo cognate replacement at a slower rate than other words, namely <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7163/full/nature06176.html\">Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history</a>.  I haven't read the paper closely myself, but note that 1) It's published in Nature, which has a bad reputation as far as language oriented papers go, and 2) None of the authors are linguists.</p>\n\n<p>As for societal differences, I know of no hard data, but I would suspect that a well regulated literary culture would slow down cognate replacement, and that high rates of language contact/bilingualism would speed it up.</p>\n", "Id":"421", "ParentId":"412", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T15:39:26.003", "OwnerUserId":"28", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-29T00:41:04.310", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
