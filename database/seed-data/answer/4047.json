I'm interested in bi-lingualism, social variation, anthropological linguistics and blog about all on MetaphorHacker.net.</p>\n\n<p>I've also been involved in teaching foreign languages and teacher training. I've taught Czech to foreigners and co-written a grammar and textbook (see Czechly.com) and I've worked as a regional language specialist for the US Peace Corps. I've also been the academic director of a private TEFL teacher training school.</p>\n"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>I agree with all the answers here. I would recommend Dixon's 'Rise and Fall of Languages' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rise-Fall-Languages-R-Dixon/dp/0521626544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rise-Fall-Languages-R-Dixon/dp/0521626544/</a> where he explores some of these issues in depth. I particularly found his analogy with 'punctuated equilibria' very useful. But he also addresses questions of language boundaries and relatedness. Well worth a read, even if a bit controversial in places.</p>\n", "Id":"4047", "ParentId":"4033", "CreationDate":"2013-07-23T17:02:52.900", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2121", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-23T17:02:52.900", "CommentCount":"2"}
