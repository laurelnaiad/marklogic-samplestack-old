{"Body":"<p>As @Cerberus has commented, these are often lumped into the category of 'determiners', which in English also includes what you've referred to as articles (the, a), possessive pronouns (my, your), and some demonstratives (this, that). These are different from normal adjectives in the following ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They can't coexist with other determiners (e.g. *the this hat, *my a car)</li>\n<li>They seem to be required on all singular non-name nouns (e.g. *car is nice)</li>\n<li>Some can appear entirely without a noun, though some of the ones that can have a morphological change involved (e.g. no cars are there > none are there, but red cars are there > *red are there)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some syntacticians have theorised that the determiner, not the noun, is the head (basically the core element) of phrases containing nouns. Adjectives, on the other hand, are just an optional component of a noun phrase.</p>\n\n<p>So, at least according to mainstream syntax, your intuition is right - while they're not 'articles' as the term is typically understood, they are in the same category as articles.</p>\n", "Id":"3934", "ParentId":"3932", "LastEditorUserId":"2132", "CreationDate":"2013-06-29T23:45:40.247", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-30T03:30:22.723", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"13", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2132", "AccountId":"2572199", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"701", "CreationDate":"2013-06-04T23:59:57.060", "DisplayName":"Sjiveru", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T21:42:32.287", "AboutMe":"<p>Still in training, but hopefully somewhat knowledgeable.
