It's clearer in the mid vowels, where the distance the tongue has to move going from [e] to [i] or [o] to [u] is longer and more easily distinguished. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, pronunciation of Spanish /e/ as /ei/ and /o/ as /ou/ is one of the characteristics of an English accent. English speakers are normally unable to distinguish the two in Spanish, just as Spanish speakers are normally unable to distinguish English tense vowels from lax, leading to <em>ship sheep late let Paul pole foot boot</em> vocabulary problems.</p>\n\n<p>There are complexities. In RP, as noted, the actual diphthong is centralized to [əʊ], and the <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/2VowelShifts.pdf\">Northern Cities Chain Shift</a> has screwed up urban American English vowels almost as thoroughly as what the Great Vowel Shift did to Middle English vowels.</p>\n", "Id":"1101", "ParentId":"1098", "CreationDate":"2011-12-01T17:47:37.910", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-01T17:47:37.910", "CommentCount":"3"}
