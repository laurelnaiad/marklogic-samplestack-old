{"Body":"<p>The Japanese case marker <em>=ga</em> (a post-clitic), was <strong>not</strong> originally a subject marker. We can easily see this in the Ryūkyūan languages, related to Japanese, as well as historically attested forms. It's important to keep in mind that standard Japanese is actually fairly innovative when compared to other Japonic languages, both historical and modern.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, <em>=ga</em> was a possessive case marker which happened to also have a usage as marking subjects (but only animate subjects; inanimate subjects used the genitive case marker <em>=no</em>) (Vovin 2005: 118). Compare this Western Old Japanese form:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>wa=Nka kəkərə</em> |1s-POSS heart| 'My heart' (Kojiki Kayou 3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And this Okinawan form:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>ari=ga guusan</em> |3s-POSS cane| 'his/her cane' (Uchima and Nohara 2006: 66)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The primary function of Korean <em>=ka</em>, to the best of my knowledge, has only ever been marking subjects. Not so with Japanese <em>=ga</em>, so not only are we only looking at a phonetic similarity (I doubt you'll find recurrent sound correspondences here--the Proto-Japonic form was prenasalized voiced <em>*=<sup>ŋ</sup>ga</em>), but also an anachronistic similarity in meaning between modern standard Korean and modern standard Japanese.</p>\n", "Id":"4671", "ParentId":"41", "LastEditorUserId":"1832", "CreationDate":"2013-10-09T09:34:58.750", "OwnerUserId":"1832", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-09T10:02:25.307", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"23", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"1832", "AccountId":"1670710", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"344", "CreationDate":"2013-03-07T05:57:57.617", "DisplayName":"limetom", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T23:38:09.323", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-09T10:02:25.307", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"23", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"1832", "AccountId":"1670710", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"344", "CreationDate":"2013-03-07T05:57:57.617", "DisplayName":"limetom", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-13T23:38:09.323", "AboutMe":""}}
