Perhaps they think that being bilingual equates to equal mastery of both language in ALL domains (social, scientific, political, economic discourses, and so on). However, the notion of a balanced bilingual is mostly a myth. My point is that you (the OP) seem to favor English for mathematical and scientific discourse. I would put your original question to a Chinese scholar in variable calculus or any other field and ask them if they think their language isn't good enough to handle the concepts.</p>\n", "Id":"3814", "ParentId":"3318", "CreationDate":"2013-06-05T16:01:03.217", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2130", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-05T16:01:03.217", "CommentCount":"1"}
