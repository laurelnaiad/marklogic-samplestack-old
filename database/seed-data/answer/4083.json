In English, the concept of \"subject\" is very well-defined in most cases, but there are a few marginal situations where it's not so obvious, for instance with dummy-insertion rules like <em>There</em>-Insertion and Extraposition</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>There are two unicorns in the garden.</em> (the verb agrees with <em>unicorns</em>)<br>\n<strong>but</strong>   </li>\n<li><p><em>There appear to be two unicorns in the garden.</em> (<em>there</em> undergoes <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/cliffs-equi-raising.pdf\">Subject-Raising</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>It was unfortunate that he vomited during his aria.</em>  (<em>That</em>-clause subject or <em>It</em> subject?)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But in other languages the concept of Subject may be nonexistent, because it depends on a particular orientation of grammatical relations that doesn't occur everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>What English (and Indo-European languages generally) mean by <strong>Subject</strong> is a relation between some noun phrase in a clause and the verb of that clause. In English, every clause has a Subject.  We contrast the Subject with the Direct Object, which is specially marked in many languages (this is the \"accusative case\", of which English has only a few remnants like <em>him</em> and <em>them</em>), and which occurs along with the Subject, but only in some clauses; we call these clauses Transitive. </p>\n\n<p>So <strong>every</strong> English clause has a Subject, but Direct Objects only occur in <strong>some</strong> clauses.<br>\nThis is called an \"Accusative\" system. There are other systems.</p>\n\n<p>One such system is the \"Ergative\" system, which is common in Mayan languages, Australian languages, Caucasian languages, and many others. In an Ergative system <strong>every</strong> clause has one kind of noun phrase (called an \"Absolutive\") and <strong>some</strong> clauses (the transitive ones) also have a specially-marked noun phrase (called an \"Ergative\") as well as an Absolutive. Not much different, except that the Ergative noun phrase in a transitive clause is what English would call the \"subject\", and the Absolutive is the \"object\".</p>\n\n<p>This is very confusing for those who don't realize that there are other ways of marking NPS.<br>\nThere's a <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/ergativity.pdf\">diagram of the differences here</a>.</p>\n", "Id":"4083", "ParentId":"4079", "CreationDate":"2013-07-30T18:57:43.467", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-30T18:57:43.467", "CommentCount":"4"}
