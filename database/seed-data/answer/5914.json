{"Body":"<p>(Revised)</p>\n\n<p>Yes I agree you need to know a lower number of symbols in order to read English than you need to know in order to read Chinese.  For English you need to know <em>26</em> symbols, out of which 5 are vowel symbols. As far as I know you need to know <em>hundreds</em> of Chinese <em>symbols</em>, in order to read quite simple texts in Chinese.</p>\n\n<p><em>No I dont agree that the spoken vowels of Chinese would be easier to learn than than vowels of the English</em> </p>\n\n<p>English has about a dozen <strong>phonemic vowel qualities</strong>, and maybe half a dozen more if you count the diphthongs.  Chinese may have fewer vowel qualities than English, but it also has <strong>phonemic tone</strong>, which English does not have.</p>\n\n<p>The number of vowels in Chinese is at least the number of distinct vowel qualities X the the number of tones.</p>\n", "Id":"5914", "ParentId":"5897", "LastEditorUserId":"2708", "CreationDate":"2013-11-16T05:46:08.623", "OwnerUserId":"2708", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-16T17:18:10.237", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"122", "Location":"South Carolina", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2708", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/100002552955579/picture?type=large", "AccountId":"3562877", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"353", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T20:18:34.430", "DisplayName":"Mario Elocio", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:34:20.273"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-16T17:18:10.237", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"122", "Location":"South Carolina", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2708", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://graph.facebook.com/100002552955579/picture?type=large", "AccountId":"3562877", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"353", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T20:18:34.430", "DisplayName":"Mario Elocio", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T23:34:20.273"}}
