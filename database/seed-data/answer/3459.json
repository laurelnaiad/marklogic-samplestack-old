{"Body":"<p>Here is a list of things you can never learn from the books (or even by Skype):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Everyday communicative patterns. How to ask for things you want to buy? What are everyday words for groceries, housewares or fastfood (provided they are not English)? What are clich√©s used by speakers of a corresponding sociolect?</p></li>\n<li><p>Sociolects. Not a problemme for languages like Swedish or Dutch, with their minimal socioliguistic distinctions, but starting from French, Spanish, Russian or Arabic a learner meets certain difficulties while choosing from you/You, gender markers, etc. Not mentioning languages with honorifics or more exotic sociolinguistic markers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Immersion is compulsory, books are not. I am not trying to promote a compulsory education, but rather an idea that one can never turn off an inner speech in a studied language while picking  up an immersion strategy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Aggressive (or otherwise unexpected) speech patterns. Yes, life is life, and human beings sometimes face aggressive rhetorics, from sarcasm and bullying to swear words, where the other side of communicative channel is not friendly or neutral. This can be extended to any unusual/unexpected speech situations and strategies as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>Personal experience building a linguistic sub-personality installed into learner's cognitive framework. Of course, this can also be achieved from the books as well, but in such a case a learner has to continue with one's inner monologue in a language learned inside one's mental reality without adequate response from the outside world.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>UPD:</strong> oh, there is one more thing: <em>lexical compatibility</em> (e.g. one would hardly say 'the target of this project is'...). I guess that is the main difference between 'planned' and 'natural' languages.</p>\n", "Id":"3459", "ParentId":"3458", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-03-29T09:40:46.973", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-30T15:19:38.967", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
