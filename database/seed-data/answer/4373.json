I don't have direct proof, but here are some speculations that may (or may not) lead to an answer.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I think you may have been confused hearing this word with a negative particle: ไม่เอา <code>[mâj au]</code> which may be perceived as <code>[mâj jau]</code> which is used very often e.g. buying food.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most <a href=\"http://wold.livingsources.org/vocabulary/23\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thai loanwords</a> with Mid-Chinese origin are phonetically similar to Cantonese pronunciation, not to Mandarin Chinese. The Cantonese pronunciation of 要 is <code>[yiu1]</code> or <code>[yiu3]</code>, unlike Mandarin <code>[yau1]</code> or <code>[yau4]</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are many other words (e.g. อยาก <code>[jàːk]</code>) that can equally be borrowed from same Mid-Chinese word (if they were).</p></li>\n<li><p>A minor difference in meanings: 要 <code>[yau1]</code> translates to <a href=\"https://pinyincity.com/hanyupinyin/search/?q=%E8%A6%81\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"demand/request/important\"</a>, while เอา <code>[au]</code> is <a href=\"http://www.thai-language.com/id/131133\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"desire/need\"</a>. In this sense, อยาก <code>[jàːk]</code> is more suitable for meaning of <a href=\"http://www.thai-language.com/id/131324\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"demand\" or \"wish\"</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The last thing. It may or may not be relevant to เ◌า, but certainly worth thinking. When traveling to Northern Thai provinces (Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai), I found something interesting. The thing is that some diphthongs have unusual pronunciation. Here's how they read it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sara Au</em> เ◌า <code>[au]</code> is read as <code>[eaː]</code></li>\n<li><em>Sara Ai Maimuan</em> ใ◌ <code>[ai]</code> read as <code>[eɯ]</code></li>\n<li><em>Sara Ai Maimalai</em> ไ◌ <code>[ai]</code> read as <code>[ei]</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You will probably hear examples of the last item by yourself, even in Central Thailand. For instance, people pronounce the negative particle ไม่ <code>[mâj]</code> as <code>[mêj]</code>, like in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ไม่มี <code>[mêj miː]</code> \"don't have\" (instead of <code>[mâj miː]</code>)</li>\n<li>ไม่ได้ <code>[mêj dâːj]</code> \"can not\" or \"was not\" (instead of <code>[mâj dâːj]</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that the \"unofficial\" pronunciation is very close to a decomposed written form, e.g. <code>ไ = เ◌ + ◌ี</code>, <code>เ◌า = เ◌ + ◌า</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I have also found a hypothesis expressed by <strong>Nantana Danvivathana</strong> in their book <a href=\"http://books.google.co.th/books?id=pXA6OilJtqwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Nantana+Danvivathana&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Nantana%20Danvivathana&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Thai Writing System</a>, page 188. Quoting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Li Fan Kuei stated in his A Handbook of Comparative Tai (1977, pp. 256, 288-289) that in Lungchow, one of the Thai languages spoken in China, words written with &lt;ไ-> in the Thai language are pronounced with <code>[ai]</code>, while words written with &lt;ใ-> are pronounced with <code>[aɯ]</code>. This gives rise to the hypothesis that in ancient Thai &lt;ไ-> was pronounced as <code>[ai]</code> and &lt;ใ-> was pronounced as <code>[aɯ]</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that this hypothesis does not confirm ไ◌ to <code>[ei]</code> or เ◌า to <code>[eaː]</code> phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>So if I was looking for an origin of เอา, I would rather look into words with <code>ea</code> pattern.</p>\n", "Id":"4373", "ParentId":"4372", "CreationDate":"2013-09-02T14:43:55.977", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-02T14:43:55.977", "CommentCount":"1"}
