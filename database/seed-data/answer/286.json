{"Body":"<p>A <strong>natural language</strong> has developed spontaneously over time and it has done it gradually. While an <strong>artificial language</strong> has been created in a relatively short time, usually for a definite aim. Now that other one is the main difference: it has been created. Also natural languages are man-made but the genesis is totally different, in terms of procedures and time.</p>\n\n<p>No-one thought \"let's create a language called English\", over time from Old English to the English we know, it developed \"by itself\", through people's usage. While Esperanto, for example was created in more or less 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike pidgins, an artificial language has a fairly complex grammar in addition to a good phonology system that is usually as complex as the creator's language, a good furnished lexicon and it's provided with syntax too.</p>\n\n<p>Natural languages have all these things as well, but like I said, in contrast to the artificial languages, they were acquired over time. There were influences, development. In other words: an evolution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I read your question again and I wanted to add that those parameters (syntax, phonology, semantics, syntax, etc) are not parameters to distinguish a natural language from the rest, since also artificial ones have them. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how it works with Sign Languages (about being a natural language or not), but since you mentioned spoken languages too, I answered to that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Answering to your comment, the point was to prove that ASL was not a \"bad gesturing imitation\" of the English language, but rather a true language on its own; this was done by Stokoe, who also encountered many obstacles doing it. The American Sign Language is complex enough under all those points, so it can't just be a simplified version of English; not to mention that it didn't even derive from English. Stokoe wrote some texts about this in case you're interested to go more in depth.</p>\n", "Id":"286", "ParentId":"285", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T10:31:28.413", "OwnerUserId":"111", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-19T13:55:58.470", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
