{"Body":"<p>According to <a href=\"http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/1103/1/mlg_iwoba_proceedings_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper</a> by Marc Greenberg, the pitch accent systems in the Western South Slavic languages are indeed reflexes of an accent system in Proto-Slavic (though, see @voikya's answer to this question for an explanation of <em>acuteness</em>, which is the feature that was relevant in that accent system). At one point all of the Slavic languages had pitch accent systems that were reflexes of this system, but only those in Western South Slavic languages survive today.  </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, he notes that the corresponding accent types in each individual modern language do not necessarily come from the same accentual category in Proto-Slavic. For example, while the falling accents in Slovene and Croatian have the same sources in Proto-Slavic the rising accents in those two languages have different sources. I am not an expert in Slavic languages, but you may find the references in Greenberg's paper useful for further investigation.</p>\n", "Id":"2006", "ParentId":"1999", "LastEditorUserId":"385", "CreationDate":"2012-05-28T14:15:30.840", "OwnerUserId":"385", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-28T21:53:07.387", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"91", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Ithaca, NY", "Id":"385", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"954986", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"2684", "CreationDate":"2011-10-05T13:37:26.247", "DisplayName":"musicallinguist", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T13:36:50.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a researcher at a company that specializes in speech synthesis research.
