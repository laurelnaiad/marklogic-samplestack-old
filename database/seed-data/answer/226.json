{"Body":"<p>Portuguese has this distinction between mass nouns and count nouns, as well. And some nouns can also be classified as both count or mass nouns depending on the sense. For example, in Portuguese <em>informação</em> (information) is a count noun, so you can say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Preciso de <strong>duas informações</em></strong> &mdash; I need two pieces of information (literally, *I need two informations).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <em>feijão</em> (beans, in the sense of food on your plate) is a mass noun, so you have to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Eu comi <strong>feijão</em></strong> (and not *<em>eu comi <strong>um feijão</strong></em> or *<em>eu comi <strong>dois feijões</strong></em>) &mdash; I have eaten beans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"226", "ParentId":"224", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T16:44:30.997", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-16T19:49:33.070", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
