{"Body":"<p>Geographically, there is not much variation in the Russian language. Basically, the variation is more related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">stress</a> placement.</p>\n\n<p>Word usage and stress are different in countries that were part of the Russian Empire and lately, the USSR. Ukraine and Belarus have their own languages, which are close to Russian, but not dialects of Russian. All of them developed from Old Slavic language. In these countries, languages are mixed and we call them \"Surzhyk\", something like \"pidgin\". This is the main difference.</p>\n\n<p>Vowel articulation is different in cities that were influenced by other non-Slavic languages. For example, in Vologda, they say [o] instead of the more common [ɒ]. It's like the pronunciation of the word \"mum\" in British English ([mom]), while Americans pronounce it [mɒm]. In Moscow, people often use [a] in words where Standard Russian has [o] or [ɒ]. Even the word \"Москва\" is pronounced as \"МАсква\". People from small cities pronounce the vowel \"e\" exactly in words where it should be \"э\". For example, they pronounce \"шинель\" as it is written, but should say \"шинЭль\".</p>\n\n<p>The St. Petersburg dialect is perceived by many as more accurate and intelligent.</p>\n", "Id":"1122", "ParentId":"1113", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2011-12-07T10:10:35.117", "OwnerUserId":"572", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-21T19:05:29.507", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
