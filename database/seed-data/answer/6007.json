{"Body":"<p>There is a notion of computational complexity in generative linguistics when, say, one is trying to justify a theory/framework by considering its physio/psychological plausibility.</p>\n\n<p>That is: If one considers a human brain (and therefore the linguistic processing centres, thereof) as a hyper-parallelised computer, any theory that appears to blow up with an NP solution can be seen as less likely, or even ruled out. Our hardware -- <em>any</em> hardware -- can't support it.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have direct references off the top of my head, but I believe this is an argument against Optimality Theory. The solution space is so vast that it quickly becomes untenable to process and, therefore, unlikely that this is actually how our brains work.</p>\n", "Id":"6007", "ParentId":"6003", "LastEditorUserId":"1175", "CreationDate":"2013-11-25T23:10:06.027", "OwnerUserId":"1175", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-25T23:16:34.747", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"3", "WebsiteUrl":"http://xoph.co/", "Id":"1175", "AccountId":"469996", "CreationDate":"2012-07-10T12:51:22.613", "AboutMe":"<p>I am, apparently, an \"Information Analyst\"; which basically means I do a lot of SQL programming in Oracle, for an academic institution.
