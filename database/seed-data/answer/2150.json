{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There's a sound change process (that can be seen as compensatory) where the merging of phonemes causes what used to be conditioned variation to be contrastive. I'll use an example from Chinese:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Middle Chinese had 4 tonal categories (although one of the \"tones\" was really just that the syllable ended in a stop consonant).</p></li>\n<li><p>Middle Chinese also had a voicing distinction. The voiced register included syllables that started with vowels, sonorants, and voiced consonants. The unvoiced register syllables started with unvoiced-unaspirated and unvoiced-aspirated consonants.</p></li>\n<li><p>Presumably the phonetic realizations of the tones was influenced by the voicing of the initial consonants. This was not contrastive though, just conditioned variation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most Chinese 'dialects' have lost truly voiced initial stops. However, in some of the daughter languages, this caused the (formerly conditioned) variation in tone to become contrastive, resulting in 8 tonal categories.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In Middle Chinese, <code>分</code> and <code>焚</code> had the same final and tone, but <code>分</code> started with a <code>/p/</code> and <code>焚</code> with a <code>/b/</code>. </p></li>\n<li><p>In Cantonese, <code>分</code> and <code>焚</code> have the same initial and final, but <code>分</code> is 1st tone and <code>焚</code> is 4th tone. </p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"2150", "ParentId":"55", "CreationDate":"2012-06-20T09:30:20.303", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1115", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-20T09:30:20.303", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"47", "WebsiteUrl":"http://peterthenelson.com", "Id":"1115", "AccountId":"1331637", "CreationDate":"2012-06-18T12:58:59.783", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm interested in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All things Chinese</li>\n<li>Historical linguistics and etymology</li>\n<li>Computationally sane models of grammar</li>\n<li>People who are not Noam Chomsky</li>\n</ul>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"251", "DisplayName":"Stumpy Joe Pete", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-10T22:34:12.867"}}
