{"Body":"<p>Your question sounds simple, but it unveils an entire area of human activity, a Natural Language Processing.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that natural languages convey the content in a <em>linked</em> manner. It means that a phrase \"build a car fueled by water\" can't stand alone. Instead, it is bound to various objects, like this: I (came up with (an idea of (how (to build a car (that is fueled by water))))). An actor, <strong>\"I\"</strong> is linked to an idea (<strong>\"a car that is...\"</strong>) through a hierarchy of relations, or links. Hence, your data mining system has to follow the entire sequence, otherwise it would be quickly confused with phrases like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have no clue how to build a car that is fueled by water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you see, the actor and the idea are essentially the same, but the linkage between them indicates the whole opposite message.</p>\n\n<p>Yet another example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't think that inventing a car that is fueled by water is a total nonsense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although a naive algorithm will find negative words (\"nonsense\", \"I don't think\"), the entire message conveys a positive idea.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you will end up with a <strong>semantic graph</strong>, like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/891i7.jpg\" alt=\"Semantic graph\"></p>\n\n<p>(image produced by the <a href=\"http://erg.delph-in.net/logon\" rel=\"nofollow\">interface that provides online access to the LinGO English Resource Grammar</a>).</p>\n\n<p>You may have notice that most common phrases have various ways to be parsed into a semantic graph. You have to use some algorithms figuring out the most probable variant.</p>\n\n<p>Please don't be discouraged by the complexity; it's not <em>that</em> terrible. :) For most practical tasks, <em>you don't have to</em> get into the full depth of analysis. However, knowing <em>theoretical</em> key points will let you focus your attention on practical implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I would suggest attending some courses that can provide you with some basis. For instance, Coursera has <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/#course/nlp\" rel=\"nofollow\">free course of NLP</a>, and they also have a <a href=\"https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture/preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">series of videos</a> that may be useful.</p>\n", "Id":"2963", "ParentId":"2962", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2012-12-12T20:38:17.537", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-12T20:49:08.483", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-12T20:49:08.483", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
