{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This is a very interesting question which has been the subject of many studies. I list just one, below. Traditionally, this question is related to the concepts of Information Density, Syllabic Rate and Information Rate (all of which are discussed and addressed in teh cited paper).</p>\n\n<p>There are a few hypotheses which I hope you will find answers your question - the main reason that they are not <strong>facts</strong> (although please feel free to disagree) is that linguists tend to disagree on the metrics of information density.</p>\n\n<p>The first is that there is a cross-linguistics \"constant\" of sorts, in relation to Information Rate. However, this is difficult to prove (for the reasons outlined above), and even within studies, it has been found that the Information Rate is not constant, but rather a range or cline.</p>\n\n<p>The second is that, because of the constant, where there is greater Information Density, the Syllabic Density will also increase (and hence the time taken to understand/express ideas will increase).</p>\n\n<p>Now, looking at the paper, it would seem that English, while having a greater Information Rate than, say, Japanese, invalidates the first hypothesis, of a <strong>strict</strong> constant. The second hypothesis, which is that language limits the Rate within a range of values to \"guarantee efficient communcation, fast enough to convey useful information and slow enough to limit the communication cost (in its articulatory, perceptual, and cognitive dimensions).\"</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the data though, one would have to consider context, social and otherwise, that would affect the IR.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://lsadc.org/info/documents/2011/press-releases/pellegrino-et-al.pdf\">A CROSS-LANGUAGE PERSPECTIVE ON SPEECH INFORMATION RATE</a></p>\n", "Id":"2577", "ParentId":"2550", "CreationDate":"2012-09-19T13:52:09.833", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1339", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-19T13:52:09.833", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://twitter.com/jamess362", "Id":"1339", "AccountId":"1857805", "CreationDate":"2012-09-19T13:35:54.527", "AboutMe":"<p>Linguist with a love of all things tech.</p>\n", "Age":"22", "Location":"Sydney, Australia", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"69", "DisplayName":"jimsug", "LastAccessDate":"2013-08-23T09:51:34.193"}}
