{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The way you worded your question implies some kind of comparison. We can't really say that acquiring Russian aspect is harder or easier than English tenses or Latin declensions. What is easier, learning Cyrillic or cuneiform or devanagari? You can only answer this question from the point of view of an L2 learner. In the case of L1 acquisition, it's all the same. All languages are learnable since their primary goal is communication.</p>\n\n<p>If you need references, I suggest you start with \"Crosslinguistic and crosscultural aspects language acquisition\" (pp. 219-224) in Fasold &amp; Connor-Linton (Eds.), An introduction to language and linguistics. After that you might want to have a look at Lust's Child language or Bavin 1995 review article \"Language acquisition in crosslinguistic perspective\" in Annual Review of Anthropology 24.</p>\n", "Id":"892", "ParentId":"778", "CreationDate":"2011-10-27T18:23:48.017", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-27T18:23:48.017", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
