{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It sounds like a matter that needs more study. It is plausible that most natural languages have nearly the same objective complexity (which could be defined variously, e.g. lexicon size + amount of morphological/inflectional rules), so that children earn proficiency at similar rates for most natural languages. But what if a child's L1 were an objectively simple language such as Ido (or Esperanto)? Has acquisition rate ever been studied for such a scenario?</p>\n\n<p>And note that it is difficult to tell how well a child is acquiring language, because the ability to speak comes more slowly than the ability to understand, and perhaps more slowly than the mental ability to form sentences. It strikes me as difficult to tell how much a pre-speech child comprehends what has been spoken. Pre-speech toddlers can be taught baby sign, which you might use to tell how well they understand speech, but I wonder if having learned a sign language might speed up speech acquisition (thus biasing your study).</p>\n", "Id":"1048", "ParentId":"778", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T01:17:35.447", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"519", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-19T01:17:35.447", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"10", "WebsiteUrl":"http://loyc-etc.blogspot.com", "Location":"Alberta, Canada", "Id":"519", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"11756", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"149", "CreationDate":"2011-11-19T00:30:16.290", "DisplayName":"Qwertie", "LastAccessDate":"2013-03-04T20:45:15.840"}}
