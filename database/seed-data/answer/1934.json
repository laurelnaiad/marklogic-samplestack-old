{"Body":"<p>@jlovegren's answer is complete, just wanted to add some points.</p>\n\n<p>Another possible reason for German to be mistaken for SOV is that <em>subordinate clauses</em> usually follow a SOV pattern.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ich weiß, daß ich ein Berliner bin.\n'I know that I am a Berliner.'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Usually, in subordinate clauses, the <em>conjugated</em> verb comes finally, whether there is another non-finite verb or not.</p>\n\n<p>Another point to make (after reading @Alenanno's comment) is that V2 doesn't necessarily even <em>look like</em> SOV, since V2 doesn't necessarily mean that the main meaning-conveying verb comes in a final position. For instance, Danish (and other Scandinavian languages AFAIK) are V2, but the main verb usually comes before the direct/indirect object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Peter ville give drengen bogen.\nPeter wanted-to give to-the-boy the-book.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If e.g. the indirect object is brought to the head position, the conjugated verb is in 2nd position, but the direct object still comes after the main verb.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Drengen ville Peter give bogen.\nTo-the-boy wanted-to Peter give the-book.\n</code></pre>\n", "Id":"1934", "ParentId":"1057", "LastEditorUserId":"724", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T00:39:26.200", "OwnerUserId":"724", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-17T01:30:20.090", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-17T01:30:20.090", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}}
