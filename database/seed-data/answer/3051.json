{"Body":"<p>In Russian anything ending -а is feminine, anything ending -о and -е are neuter and anything ending with a consonant is masculine. Abbreviations case is determined based on the main noun in the abbreviation (this is the rule), but sometimes the speakers also apply the usual rules to the abbreviation as well, that is determine the gender based on the pronunciation, for instance \"НАТО\" (\"NATO\") is often used as neuter because of the -O ending, ВУЗ already became masculine this way. This happens mostly with familiar, often-used abbreviations which gradually become accepted as nouns.</p>\n\n<p>The only remaining cases are the words ending with -и, -у whose gender is usually determined by the class to which the noun refers (city, river, organization).</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple exceptions though.</p>\n", "Id":"3051", "ParentId":"3044", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2013-01-08T14:02:01.267", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-08T14:07:02.943", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-08T14:07:02.943", "Score":"-2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
