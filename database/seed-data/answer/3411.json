{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I'm not sure if this is as understudied as you might think. What you're describing is a laryngeal feature used to mark the edges of an utterance. That's pretty common. The laryngeal feature used, though, might vary quite a bit between languages. They can be glottal stops, pitch, aspiration, devoicing, creaky voice, etc. Searching for something like laryngeal markers at utterance boundaries might give you more interesting hits.</p>\n", "Id":"3411", "ParentId":"2585", "CreationDate":"2013-03-21T15:03:01.547", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"105", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-21T15:03:01.547", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://folk.uio.no/sverrej/", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"105", "AccountId":"510125", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"289", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T05:45:56.533", "DisplayName":"Sverre", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-09T14:44:26.807", "AboutMe":""}}
