{"Body":"<p>After a bit of searching I can now partially answer my own question 1, about these constructions in Latin and Greek: apparently both have basically the same construction as English, using an indefinite relative pronoun (usually <em>quisquis</em> in Latin, ὅστις or ὁστισοῦν in Greek) and a verb in the indicative.</p>\n\n<p>Latin:</p>\n\n<p><em>hostem qui feriet, mihi erit Carthaginiensis, <strong>quisquis erit</em></strong> 'whoever kills an enemy will be a Carthaginian in my eyes, <strong>whoever he may be</strong>' (Cicero <em>Balbus</em> 22.51)</p>\n\n<p><em>ita ille faxit Iuppiter, ut ille palam ibidem adsiet, <strong>quisquis illest, qui adest a milite</em></strong> 'I wish Jupiter would so make it, that he were openly in the same place with me, <strong>whoever he is, that has arrived from the Captain</strong>' (Plautus <em>Pseudolus</em> 4.1.22-4)</p>\n\n<p>Greek:</p>\n\n<p>δεινῶς γ᾽ ἔοικεν ἀποκεκρυμμένην τέχνην ἀνευρεῖν ὁ Τεισίας ἢ ἄλλος <strong>ὅστις δή ποτ᾽ ὢν τυγχάνει καὶ ὁπόθεν χαίρει ὀνομαζόμενος</strong> 'a wonderfully hidden art it seems to be which Tisias has brought to light, or some other, <strong>whoever he may be and whatever country he is proud to call his own</strong>!' (Plato <em>Phaedrus</em> 273c)</p>\n\n<p>Greek additionally has a slightly different construction which places the free relative clause inside a conditional:</p>\n\n<p>μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ ἀσεβοῦντι <strong>μηδ᾽ ἂν ὁστισοῦν τυγχάνῃ ὤν</strong> '[we ought not] to let him who acts impiously go unpunished, <strong>no matter who he may be</strong>', lit. 'not even if he happens to be whoever'.
