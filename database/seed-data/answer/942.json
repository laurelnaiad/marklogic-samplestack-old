{"OwnerDisplayName":"user325", "Body":"<p>The behavior with semi-vowels has to do with their level of sonority. Typically, a vowel is the peak of sonority in a syllable. Semi-vowels are vowels which are not the peak of sonority because they precede and/or are followed by a more sonorous (open) vowel.</p>\n\n<p>In principle, any vowel could become a semi-vowel if it preceded or was followed by something more sonorous (think less constriction) than it was, perhaps with the exception of low vowels (because they are the most sonorous sounds). In reality, I am not sure about the existence of mid semi-vowels, outside of the off-glide in falling diphthongs as in /a ä/. Alek Storm listed the semi-vowels for the high vowels. Any other types of semi-vowels would probably not have distinctive symbols in the IPA because of their rarity.</p>\n\n<p>It is also worth noting that it is not mandatory that a vowel become a glide if it is precedes or is followed by something more sonorous. A language might instead treat each vowel as the nucleus of its own syllable. It depends on the language's syllabification rules.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, vowels need not be the nucleus of a syllable: anything which is more sonorant than the surrounding segments can be. Languages vary on what types of segments they will allow to be syllabic nuclei, but Berber famously allows fricatives and stops: <em>tf.tkt</em> 'you sprained'. </p>\n", "Id":"942", "ParentId":"905", "CreationDate":"2011-11-03T15:25:39.747", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-03T15:25:39.747", "comments":[]}
