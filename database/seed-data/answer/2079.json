It still does represent a cluster in some languages (e.g., Bulgarian /ʃt/, Ukrainian /ʃtʃ/), but in others has evolved into a single sound (e.g., [standard] Russian /ɕ:/).</p>\n\n<p>The reason this particular letter stuck around is because it had a useful function: the cluster /ʃt'/ in Old Church Slavonic wasn't just any cluster, but it had an important morphophonemic function, being the jotated counterpart to /st/. In addition, Old Church Slavonic simply didn't have another good way of representing /ʃtʲ/, since palatalized /tʲ/ only occurred phonemically in this particular cluster; this probably encouraged more frequent use of the letter, although this is just me speculating.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure, but I believe Greek ψ and ξ are similar, in that the clusters /ps/ and /ks/ have a special significance in the language, but I'm not very familiar with Greek.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, morphophonemics can be a good motivator to have a single letter represent what's phonetically two sounds.</p>\n", "Id":"2079", "ParentId":"2076", "CreationDate":"2012-06-08T18:04:59.263", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1054", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-08T18:04:59.263", "CommentCount":"4"}
