There have to be 12 unique base units for duodecimal, just as there have to be 16 for hexadecimal.</p>\n\n<p>They're not always present, however. And the other numbers between 10 and 20 show quite a lot of variation, even in European languages, as you point out for various Romance languages. </p>\n\n<p>Probably the main generalization here is that numbers, and number patterns, often repeat the </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>One</em></strong> - Singular</li>\n<li>(<strong><em>Two</em></strong>) - (Dual)</li>\n<li><em><strong>Many</em></strong> - Plural</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>pattern found in, for instance</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Singular (Dual) Plural<br>\nDual words and morphology are irregular and arbitrary (e.g, Eng <em>glasses, pants, both, pair, couple</em>)</li>\n<li>1-syllable Comparative <em>bigger</em> (2-syllable <em>easier/more solid</em>) Polysyllable <em>more interesting</em><br>\nDisyllabic comparatives are irregular and arbitrary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>as well as many other linguistic phenomena, which suggests that duality of one kind or another is semantically unusual, and has some of the irregular and arbitrary characteristics of the numeral <em>one</em> (which is often extended for use as a demonstrative, a pronoun, or an article, and which has unique syntax in every language); as well as some of the regular characteristics of compositional numbers like <em>seventy-three</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Dual is transitional between singular and plural, and it's semantically significant because we are bilaterally symmetric animals and therefore have plenty of reason to refer to things that come in pairs. Plus there are two sexes which mate in pairs, and that's an area rife with irregularity and arbitrariness.</p>\n\n<p>This extends to decades (for 10-based systems; I'll use the term for all recurring sequences, of whatever base) as well as numbers. In any system, the first decade is usually composed of unique base units (though not always; in Ute, for instance, <em>nine</em> means 'almost ten'). The second decade is full of irregularities, but not usually new bases. The third and following decades are usually very regular.</p>\n", "Id":"3789", "ParentId":"3787", "CreationDate":"2013-05-31T18:05:38.187", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-31T18:05:38.187", "CommentCount":"2"}
