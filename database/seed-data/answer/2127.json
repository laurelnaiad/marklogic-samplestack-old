{"Body":"<p>In the Role and Reference grammar framework, clause chaining is usually analyzed as a type of <em>cosubordination</em> (a type of clause linkage where two non-finite clauses are both embedded in a matrix clause). Cosubordination exists alongside the more familiar clause-linking prototypes coordination and subordination. Complementization is a type of subordination construction where the verb of a finite matrix clause takes as one of its arguments a subordinate clause. Situating clause-chaining and complementization within the more general typology of clause-linkage, we see that these are instantiations of general clause-linkage strategies, all of which are well-attested cross-linguistically. For a language to have both clause-chaining and complementization then should not be unusual or surprising, then.</p>\n\n<p>Chechen (see <a href=\"http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcgood/jcgood-Chechen_Clause-Combining.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good 2003</a> for a thorough presentation) has both clause-chaining as well as subordination, so it will probably fit the bill.</p>\n", "Id":"2127", "ParentId":"2098", "LastEditorUserId":"483", "CreationDate":"2012-06-18T02:04:34.860", "OwnerUserId":"483", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-18T03:01:30.827", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-18T03:01:30.827", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
