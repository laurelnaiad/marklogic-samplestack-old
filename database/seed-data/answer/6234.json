{"Body":"<p>The difference should be defined by the usage of Nominative VS Accusative. For most Icelandic nouns, it should be obvious, e.g.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>armur (an arm):      minn armur (Nom.) =>   minn arm (Gen.)`</p>\n  \n  <p>afi (a grandfather): minn afi (Nom.)   =>   minn afa (Gen.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>saga (a story):      minn saga (Nom.)  =>   minn s√∂gu (Gen.)</p>\n\n<p>I think the ambiguity you have mentioned exists only in phrases with definiteness marked by possessive pronouns plus nouns of certain declension types (<em>one-syllable feminine words with final a consonant of both declensions and neutrum of both declension types</em>),  for my intuition is that in sg. definite form no possessive pronoun should be used.</p>\n\n<p>There should also be some syntaxical tools to mark a subject VS a possessor (see e.g. an answer by user2619), or a commonsense logic to distinguish animate vs inanimate.</p>\n", "Id":"6234", "ParentId":"6226", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-12-23T10:08:24.363", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-25T10:20:00.390", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
