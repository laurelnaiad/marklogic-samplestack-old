{"Body":"<p>Latin <em>semen</em> comes from <em>sero</em>, \"to sow\", which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European *sÄ“(i)-, \"to sow\". (The Latin <em>r</em> is from reduplication and rhotacism between vowels, in that order. The reduplication happened in Proto-Indo-European.)</p>\n\n<p>The Latin suffix <em>-men</em> is related to Greek <em>-ma</em> as in <em>comma, stigma, telegram[ma], etc.</em>. It is quite common in Latin, as in <em>limen</em>, gen. <em>liminis</em> (English <em>sub-lime</em>), <em>omen, nomen</em>. It probably existed in Proto-Indo-European already, since it also exists in Germanic and Slavic; the ancestor of <em>semen</em> was probably formed in Proto-Indo-European, not in Latin.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we could prove that Hebrew borrowed it from Latin or Proto-Indo-European, or that Hebrew had the same morphemes, I think it is safest to assume that this is a coincidence, as it is usually the case with resemblances across different linguistic families.</p>\n", "Id":"2452", "ParentId":"2451", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2012-08-22T13:55:11.590", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-23T13:16:27.507", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-23T13:16:27.507", "Score":"14", "CommentCount":"17", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
