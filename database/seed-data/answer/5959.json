Strong Presentation and Negotiation Skills have been key to this work (in addition to the full monte; infrastructure, database design, core algorithms, scaling, backed and frontend frameworks, test-ability, compliance, and UI/UX + SEO). </p>\n\n<p>I also design technology &amp; products by drawing from a history of fabrication, prototyping, sourcing, and scientific research (applied physics).  I am a practicing sculptor, and establish new product aesthetics via my own approach to engineering fluid-mechanical processes.  From this work in water, I have built a broad &amp; deep knowledge-base on the application of fluid phenomenon to industry needs.</p>\n\n<p>I have lead successful small-capitalization stages, wrote grants &amp; engaged program officers, developed teams and timelines, design of experiments, measurement, and business development.</p>\n"}}
