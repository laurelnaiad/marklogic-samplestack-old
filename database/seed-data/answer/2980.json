{"Body":"<h1>Why in English name of months are capitalized but name of seasons do not?</h1>\n\n<p>The first part seems to be trivial. Names of months and days of week (DoW) are <strong>proper nouns</strong> since they are dedicated to certain deities: Roman for months and Norse for DoW. So they are capitalized as any proper names.</p>\n\n<p>September to December are proper nouns as well for unification reasons, AFAIU.</p>\n\n<p>As per seasons, <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/52937/26446\">this question at EL&amp;U</a> seems to be relevant. Quoted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The four seasons are lowercased.</li>\n  <li><em>Except</em> when part of a formal name, such as the name of an event (Winter Olympics), school term (Spring Quarter 2012), or issue of a journal (Summer 2008).</li>\n  <li><em>Except</em> when the season is personified, as in poetry.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Is there any languages that in its orthography seasons names are capitalized?</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/language/time/seasons.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This table</a> suggests that Alsatian, Aragonese, Cebuano, Chechen, Fristian (Saterfrisian), German, German (Swiss), Greenlandic, Jèrriais, Low German, Luxembourgish, Somali, and several constructed languages <strong>do capitalize season names</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: At least some of these languages, such as German, capitalize <strong>all</strong> nouns.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#Capitalization_of_month_names\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikimedia</a> has a list that says Afrikaans, Breton, Welsh, Modern Greek, English, German, Herero, Indonesian, Latin, Malay, Portuguese, Venda, Xhosa, and Zuku <strong>do capitalize month names</strong>.<br>\nAlso, <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/language/time/months.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this list</a> seems to be more detailed.<br>\nAnd <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/language/time/days.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">days of the week</a>, just for sake of completeness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As per the month names originated from other languages (including those not having capitalization at all), there are various (and maybe controversial) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aNaming_conventions_%28capitalization%29#Capitalization_of_expressions_borrowed_from_other_languages\" rel=\"nofollow\">spelling rules</a>, but AFAIK most of them suggest using the <em>target</em> language capitalization rules.<br>\nHence, Thai <code>ธันวาคม</code> (December) should be spelled <code>Tanwaakhom</code>, not <code>tanwaakhom</code> (obviously, except when your reason is delivering a pure phonetic transcription, then everything is lower case).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further reading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/capitals.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/capitals.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wps.ablongman.com/long_longman_ohb_1/0,10005,1798020-content,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wps.ablongman.com/long_longman_ohb_1/0,10005,1798020-content,00.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"2980", "ParentId":"2977", "LastEditorUserId":"2164", "CreationDate":"2012-12-17T19:49:19.613", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-17T01:11:21.017", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~strasdat/", "Id":"2164", "AccountId":"903836", "CreationDate":"2013-06-17T00:57:33.887", "AboutMe":"<p>PhD student in Robot Vision</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"London, United Kingdom", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"103", "DisplayName":"Hauke Strasdat", "LastAccessDate":"2013-06-17T00:57:33.887"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-17T01:11:21.017", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
