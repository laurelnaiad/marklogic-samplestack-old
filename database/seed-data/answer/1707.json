{"Body":"<p>Hebrew (and, I guess, Semitic languages in general) defaults to masculine too for a mixed group. But it doesn't have neutral.</p>\n\n<p>Hebrew has four genders: male, female, male plural, female plural. For the plural form, if there is so much as a single male in a group of people, then the group is addressed as male. A hairsplitting example would be in literature aimed at women: despite the fact that a man could read such a magazine, the audience is in fact referred to in the plural female gender.</p>\n", "Id":"1707", "ParentId":"1706", "LastEditorUserId":"536", "CreationDate":"2012-03-27T15:32:18.063", "OwnerUserId":"874", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-28T10:42:00.117", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-28T10:42:00.117", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"874", "AccountId":"1357955", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2012-03-27T15:32:18.063", "DisplayName":"Yaroslav", "LastAccessDate":"2012-03-27T15:32:18.063"}}
