Semivowels are phones which are phonetically vowels (or vowel-like) but which function as a consonant phoneme in a given language. The distinction between phonetics and phonology is crucial as phonetically identical phones may function as a vowel phoneme in one language, and as a consonant in another. As well, a phonetically identical sequence of two vowels may function as a diphthong (ie single phoneme) in one language and as a sequence of two vowel phonemes in another.</p>\n", "Id":"2540", "ParentId":"2538", "CreationDate":"2012-09-07T09:32:00.190", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-07T09:32:00.190", "CommentCount":"0"}
