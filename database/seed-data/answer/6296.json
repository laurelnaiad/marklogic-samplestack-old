These differences are abandoned in music, because the words must be sung to the tones, and timing, of the songs. (This is why we mishear lyrics to a song from listening to it more often than we mishear what someone is saying to us, even if we are listening in our native language.) The only way to detect accent in music is phonological differences, and even these are distorted by the background music.</p></li>\n<li><p>Specifically to English, one of the noteable differences between American English and most of the rest of the anglophone world is the pronunciation of syllable-final /r/s.
