Linguistics is my life-long passion, I can speak and read no less than 12 languages well, I am studying Malay and Manju at the moment. My native languages are Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n", "Age":"37"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>No language is \"<em>more simple</em>\" than other languages. Old English had just 2 tenses, present and past, now there are 16 of them, future and future-in-the-past forms developed over the time, the continuous aspect appeared, the perfect appeared, so the verbal system acquired much more forms than it used to have. On the other hand, the nouns lost the gender and cases. It is always like that, if something is lost, some new features appear to compensate the loss.</p>\n\n<p>A good example of a language that gets more and more complicated over the course of time is Chinese. The Old Chinese had no parts of speech, no number, no tense, it was a monosyllabic isolating language. Now Chinese is developing in the direction of getting more complicated, its words are mostly two-syllable now, parts of speech appeared in it, tenses begin to appear, etc.</p>\n\n<p>And some languages can become more simple during some period, and then again get more complicated. Hindi is like that, first it lost all the cases which were in Sanskrit, but later it developed a new system of cases. </p>\n", "Id":"6399", "ParentId":"6397", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T15:39:17.950", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2689", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-14T15:39:17.950", "CommentCount":"6"}
