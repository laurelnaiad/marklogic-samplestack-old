Thomas Payne's \"Describing Morphosyntax\" is a great beginners guide for those documenting language, but you could use it as a check list to make sure you've not forgotten to include anything in your language. It would also help you figure out what interesting features of language exist that we don't necessarily have in the languages you already know.</p>\n", "Id":"3358", "ParentId":"3354", "CreationDate":"2013-03-11T20:34:52.570", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"64", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-11T20:34:52.570", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"126", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.superlinguo.com", "Id":"64", "AccountId":"900445", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:45:12.903", "AboutMe":"<p>I have a PhD in linguistics.
