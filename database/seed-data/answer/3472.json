{"Body":"<p>I'm afraid this is a rather poor question. However, instead of voting to close it because it's off-topic, I'll attempt to explain in an answer what's wrong with it.</p>\n\n<p>The question uses the terms <em>Prescriptivist</em> and <em>Descriptivist</em> without qualification, presupposing that they are well-known and well-defined terms, that they actually refer to two different real groups of real people, and that there are in opposition. </p>\n\n<p>None of this is true. That means that, whatever you're asking about, there's no answer to this question.</p>\n\n<p>There may be people who wish to define themselves as <strong><em>P</em></strong> or <strong><em>D</em></strong>, for all I know -- \nthere are people who will do <strong>anything</strong>. But there are certainly no coherent groups of <strong><em>P</em></strong> or <strong><em>D</em></strong> people, and there is absolutely no coherent viewpoint represented by the terms.</p>\n\n<p>There <strong>are</strong> people who believe that there is only one correct way to speak or write a particular language (oddly enough, that always turns out to be the way <strong>they</strong> speak or write it). Some may call them <em>prescriptive</em>, since they <em>prescribe</em> behavior for others, like a doctor prescribing medicine; others use different terms, from different metaphors. Almost none of these people are linguists. Some of them may consider themselves <strong><em>P</em></strong>; others may not.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are people who believe that <em>language</em> is what people speak and write and that no bit of language is inherently \"better\" than any other. Some of these people are linguists. And some linguists <strong>do</strong> describe language and languages, so some might call them <em>descriptive</em>, like a biologist describing natural phenomena; but there are very few linguists in total, so real descriptivists are a very small part of this group, and very few of them besides linguists would consider themselves to be <strong><em>D</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are lots of other people, with lots of other opinions about language and correct behavior. They aren't either <strong><em>P</em></strong> or <strong><em>D</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The result is that it's impossible to identify the two groups you mentioned, or to identify members of either group, so anybody can say anything they like about them. And they do. But there's no information in it.</p>\n", "Id":"3472", "ParentId":"3470", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2013-03-31T15:45:42.607", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-31T18:05:40.713", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
