It is also commonly used in descriptive linguistics to refer to an <a href=\"http://www.glottopedia.de/index.php/Native_Speaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">ideal informant</a> (or, \"ideal speaker-hearer\") who has full \"competence\" in the target language sufficient to enable a description of the grammar of that language based on the informant's \"performance\". We would then talk about \"native level competence\" in the language. I would say that this last definition is informal, though widely understood within the discipline.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like you may have native-speaker level of competence in English, and so could label yourself a native speaker of that language. But you could also be considered a native speaker of Portuguese although to linguists you would not be an ideal informant, having lost some competence in the language and perhaps no longer having true native speaker intuitions about it. In the end it depends on your preferred sense of identity. The form you describe should allow inclusion of more than one native language, but there is a strong ideology of monoglottalism in some nations (my own, Australia, is an example) and I suspect the form is from one of these.</p>\n", "Id":"1995", "ParentId":"1994", "CreationDate":"2012-05-27T13:32:10.183", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-27T13:32:10.183", "CommentCount":"1"}
