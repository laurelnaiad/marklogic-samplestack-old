There is some disagreement about the sub-grouping of Romance: many (though perhaps not all) scholars posit a division into Eastern Romance (Italian, Romanian and the other Balkan Romance languages) and Western Romance (Gallo-Romance and Ibero-Romance). Any such division has to be based on shared innovations within each sub-group. There is no doubt that Spanish and Italian sound rather similar to each other, and sound rather different from French or Portuguese, but this is because Spanish and Italian are both phonologically quite conservative (that is: their sound system has changed less than other Romance languages in comparison with Latin). This is a shared retention and is not relevant for sub-grouping, which needs to be based on shared innovations only.</p>\n", "Id":"6395", "ParentId":"6394", "CreationDate":"2014-01-14T11:19:56.753", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2556", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-14T11:19:56.753", "CommentCount":"3"}
