In general, an <code>NP</code> will contain a <code>Dʹ</code>.<br>\nFor instance, the subject of the following sentence</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Quite a few of the more than ten thousand people took his advice.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>would be parsable as [<code>NP</code> [<code>Dʹ</code> <em>Quite ...  thousand</em> <code>Dʹ</code>] [N <em>people</em> N] NP].</p>\n\n<p>Whether <code>Dʹ</code> is actually the same constituent type as <code>DP</code><br>\ndepends entirely on one's preferred nomenclatural presuppositions.<br>\nIt doesn't bear on descriptions of phenomena, except to counsel one<br>\nto avoid confusing modes of expression; after all, the idea is to be <strong>clear</strong>.</p>\n", "Id":"6224", "ParentId":"6212", "CreationDate":"2013-12-22T18:02:26.117", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-22T18:02:26.117", "CommentCount":"5"}
