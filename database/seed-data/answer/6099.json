{"Body":"<p>A language with a triple vowel harmony distinction is Manchu. In this language there are three \"strong\" vowels, <code>a, e, o</code> and two \"weak\" ones, <code>i, u</code>. The vowel harmony in Manchu is a bit tricky, in a word a \"strong\" vowel can be followed by the same \"strong\" one or by any of the \"weak\" ones, but a \"weak\" vowel can be followed by a \"weak\" vowel or by <code>a</code>, but never by <code>o</code>. That is, three sets of vowels are possible within a word:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>a, i, u</li>\n  <li>e, i, u</li>\n  <li>o, i, u</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The 3rd row can also be like that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>o, o, ..., i/u ..., a, i, u.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the 3rd row can change into the 1st one, so we can say the vowel harmony in Manchu has a stair-step character.</p>\n\n<p>According to that vowel harmony, suffixes in Manchu are of the two kinds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>some have a \"weak\" vowel and they never change, since they can be added to roots that have any vowels: <code>-mbi</code> - present tense, <code>-fi</code> - participle: \"arafi\" (having written), \"genefi\" (having gone), \"songofi\" (having wept), \"arabumbi\" (make write), \"genebumbi\" (make go);</li>\n<li>others have three variants, with each of the strong vowels: <code>-sa/-se/-so</code> - plural noun suffix, <code>-ha/-he/-ho</code> - past participle: \"araha\" (wrote), \"genehe\" (went), \"songoho\" (wept).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The change of the 3rd row into the 1st one can be illustrated by \"songobuha\" (made weep), where the <code>u</code> in the causative suffix <code>-bu</code> changes the 3rd <code>o</code> row into the 1st <code>a</code> row, so <code>-ha</code>, not <code>-ho</code> is added.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/tungus/avrorin_manchu_gr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">В.
