{"Body":"<p>Probably even the visual learning you had only happened because you were spoken to, even if you didn't speak yourself. It is not unusual that someone does not know how to pronounce a word he/she knows how to write or the opposite, not knowing how to write a word he/she uses in spoken language</p>\n\n<p>You can learn a language through visual or acustic signifiers &ndash; be it English, Portuguese or other.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, it is hard to teach written language to deaf children, at least concerning the kind of writing we are using here, because it is \"sound based\", i.e., letters correspond to sounds. So a deaf person in general needs to go through an \"oralization\" process, to learn reading and writing well.</p>\n\n<p>As to pictographic writing, like chinese, maybe it could be learned withouth oralization, but this is just a speculation, as I have no experience with this.</p>\n", "Id":"2119", "ParentId":"2114", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2012-06-16T22:58:33.430", "OwnerUserId":"1107", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-17T00:22:45.807", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
