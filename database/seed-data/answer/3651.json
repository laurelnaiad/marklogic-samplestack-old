In each of these languages I found a handful of forms that on the surface appear to violate the expected inflectional pattern (e.g. in Japanese there are some verbs that consist of vowel-final stems and vowel-initial suffixes, despite the tendency everywhere else for vowel-final stems to \"select\" consonant-initial allomorphs of suffixes). I found that, in each case, no single ranking of constraints could account for the majority of forms plus these exceptional forms.</p>\n\n<p>It turned out that adopting a stratal model--one with a unique \"stem phonology\" constraint ranking and one with a unique \"word phonology\" constraint ranking--could account for all of the data.</p>\n", "Id":"3651", "ParentId":"3639", "CreationDate":"2013-05-06T15:15:17.117", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"385", "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-06T15:15:17.117", "CommentCount":"3"}
