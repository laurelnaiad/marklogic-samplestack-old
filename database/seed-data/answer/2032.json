{"Body":"<p>While I don't know of existing work on the subject, one approach you might take would be to recreate a Flesch-Kincaid-like scale for speech.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First step: determine what levels you want your scale to map to.</strong><br>\nYou might take something like \"conversation/dialogue\", \"presentations/monologue\", and \"formal speeches\" to be three levels on such a scale (at least for an initial experiment).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second step: build a classifier</strong><br>\nYou could use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Naive Bayes</a> or <a href=\"http://www.kamalnigam.com/papers/maxent-ijcaiws99.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">MaxEnt</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">NLTK</a>, for instance, with a simple set of features. If you're going for a hard-analogue to Flesch-Kincaid, go for the two simplest features to extract which approximately measure lexical difficulty and syntactic difficulty. For a corpus of speech, you might use word-length (measured by syllables, phones, or orthographic length) and utterance length (rather than sentence length; how many words are in each utterance). For each document, calculate average word length and average sentence length and see how well your classifier does. </p>\n\n<p>If it's able to consistently distinguish among the classes, you ought to be able to come up with an F-K-style formula that could be used to classify things on the \"conversation-monologue-speech\" continuum.</p>\n", "Id":"2032", "ParentId":"1194", "LastEditorUserId":"146", "CreationDate":"2012-05-31T18:25:51.523", "OwnerUserId":"146", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-19T15:10:52.737", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.davehowcroft.com", "Id":"146", "AccountId":"386467", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T04:22:32.443", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a graduate student in the Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University.
