A number of verbs can have those; they are similar to how copulae can have subject complements in that they either identify the object with its complement (<em>I consider him my best friend</em>) or assign/apply a property to it (<em>I consider him dull</em>), just as copulae do this with a subject and its complement. Other examples:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He painted the house black.</p>\n  \n  <p>She kept him locked up.</p>\n  \n  <p>She had him fired. (Alternative analyses are possible.)</p>\n  \n  <p>He made her his wife.</p>\n  \n  <p>She bought him free.</p>\n  \n  <p>She set him free.</p>\n  \n  <p>He killed her first, her husband second.</p>\n  \n  <p>He pronounced them wife and wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Etc. Some verbs can typically take this construction (like <em>consider</em>), and some adjectives typically allow this construction with many verbs (like <em>first</em>).</p>\n", "Id":"4786", "ParentId":"4784", "CreationDate":"2013-10-24T18:57:05.827", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-24T18:57:05.827", "CommentCount":"9"}
