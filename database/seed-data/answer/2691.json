Each item is gone though, with points assigned for features the same - identical are given full points, differences that are minimal are given less points, and there are no points for completely different items. The great thing about this is that it can be done across multiple languages/dialects at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>There are probably computer programs that can do this now, and more sophisticated analytical processes, but for a small list it's not that hard to do it be hand as long as you have a rudimentary knowledge of phonetics/phonology. </p>\n\n<p>Blair, F.
