Anyway, it seems that this is a case of <code>metathesis</code>, which is a process that reorders the segments of a given string. Thus, perhaps <code>crocodilo</code> became <code>cocodrilo</code> after the /r/ was reordered in the word. In Italian it is very similar: <code>coccodrillo</code>, so Spanish is not the only case as you think. This phenomenon could have started in Latin for <code>crocodilus</code>, and this would explain that Spanish and Italian exhibit the metathesis too. </p>\n", "Id":"3245", "ParentId":"3244", "CreationDate":"2013-02-21T23:13:17.973", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-21T23:13:17.973", "CommentCount":"2"}
