{"Body":"<p>Regarding \"why\", it's believed that most languages will go for \"maximal dispersion\" and try to have vowels as acoustically distinct as possible (or, as <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/207443/Explaining_vowel_systems_Dispersion_Theory_vs._Natural_Selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">easily learnable</a> as possible).  So if they choose three vowels, it will very often be /a,i,u/ ;  /i,u/ are easier to distinguish than /y,ɯ/ or /u,o/ (<a href=\"http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~jean-luc.schwartz/fichiers_public_JLS/fichiers_pdf/Schwartz_Boe_JPhonetics1997_1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ref</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are always oddities; Ubykh had just /ə,a/ (and 84 consonants!).  But, querying <a href=\"http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">UPSID</a> (a database of 451 languages) for languages with no back vowels return 0 results.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion your language would be highly unusual, and yes I find it likely that over time it would change into an easier system, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily impossible to occur.  Schwarts et al (cited above) remark that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>in both primary and secondary [vowel] systems , the sounds are mainly concentrated at the periphery [i.e. both front and back, high and low] […] if there is an asymmetry (around 30% of the cases) , the number of front vowels is likely to be greater than the number of back vowels (3 times more likely in primary systems, 2 times more in secondary systems).</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"3680", "ParentId":"3665", "LastEditorUserId":"200", "CreationDate":"2013-05-09T13:57:37.340", "OwnerUserId":"200", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-16T14:19:42.270", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"15", "WebsiteUrl":"http://namakajiri.net/nikki", "Location":"Brazil", "Id":"200", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"531597", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"421", "CreationDate":"2011-09-20T20:19:46.470", "DisplayName":"leoboiko", "LastAccessDate":"2013-09-16T22:57:14.117", "AboutMe":"<p>Japanese Studies grad student.
