Insofar as this variant is produced, /s/ deletion can apply to it.  (It would be tricksy to measure this, though, as after total /s/ deletion this variant is homophonous with the standard form.  But you could count lenited tokens.)</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"126", "ParentId":"4", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T17:20:09.470", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T17:20:09.470", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
