{"OwnerDisplayName":"j-g-faustus", "Body":"<p>From <a href=\"http://email.eva.mpg.de/~haspelmt/2001wcl.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Word classes and parts of speech (pdf)</a>, a 2001 paper:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite the theoretical problems in\n  defining word classes in general, in\n  practice it is often not diï¬ƒcult to\n  agree on the use of these terms in a\n  particular language. This is because\n  nouns, verbs, and adjectives show\n  great similarities in their behavior\n  across languages. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The general properties of nouns,\n  verbs, and adjectives ... are\n  sufficient to establish these classes\n  without much doubt in a great many\n  languages. However, again and again\n  linguists report on languages where\n  such a threefold subdivision does not\n  seem appropriate. Particularly\n  problematic are adjectives ... but\n  languages lacking a noun- verb\n  distinction are also claimed to exist\n  ..., and ... adverbs ... present\n  difficulties in all languages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And towards the end:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hengeveld (1992a) proposed that major\n  word classes can either be lacking in\n  a language (then it is called rigid)\n  or a language may not differentiate\n  between two word classes (then it is\n  called flexible). Thus, `languages\n  without adjectives' ... are\n  either flexible in that they combine\n  nouns and adjectives in one class\n  (N/Adj), or rigid in that they lack\n  adjectives completely. </p>\n  \n  <p>Hengeveld\n  claims that besides the English type,\n  where all four classes (V - N - Adj - Adv)\n  are differentiated and exist, there are\n  only three types of rigid languages\n  (V - N - Adj, e.g., Wambon; V - N, e.g.,\n  Hausa; and V, e.g., Tuscarora), and\n  three types of flexible languages\n  (V - N - Adj/Adv, e.g., German;\n  V - N/Adj/Adv, e.g., Quechua;\n  V/N/Adj/Adv, e.g., Samoan).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Universal</em> language support is tricky at best, as far as I know linguists are still arguing about which aspects of language are universal and to what extent. (<em>Universal</em> here meaning \"applying to every natural language that could conceivably be used by a human being\".)</p>\n\n<p>From a practical standpoint, e.g. for the purposes of making a program, there is also the question of how common the various language classes are. For example Tuscarora, mentioned as an example above, has a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skarure\" rel=\"nofollow\">grand total of 52 speakers</a> (according to Wikipedia), and it may become a business decision how far out of your way you are willing to go to support it.</p>\n\n<p>IANAL (with the L here meaning Linguist), I merely read up on similar topics in a similar context a few years ago.</p>\n", "Id":"1141", "ParentId":"1138", "CreationDate":"2011-02-10T19:09:49.683", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2011-02-10T19:09:49.683", "CommentCount":"3", "comments":[]}
