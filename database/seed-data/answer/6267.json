{"Body":"<p>1.Any <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic\" rel=\"nofollow\">polysynthetic</a> language would have such a feature having within any of its word-sentences a 'verbal' particle. This is also one of the traits characteristical for French (with no distinction between parts of speech used for word formation, but with occasional differentiation between grammatical forms of the components), because this language may be considered as polysynthetic: <strong><em>prêt-à-porter</em></strong> (lit. ready-for-to wear, adj.+ preposition + noun), <strong><em>bien-dire</em></strong> (eloquence, lit. 'good-to speak'), <strong><em>bien-être</em></strong> (well-being, lit. 'good-to be'), or words like <strong><em>pince-sans-rire</em></strong> (a mocker with a poker face, lit. 'pinch-without-to laugh').</p>\n\n<p>This principle of word-formation also includes combinations of noun+verb: <strong><em>un couvre-lit</em></strong> (bedspread, lit. '[you]cover-bed'), <strong><em>un tire-bouchon</em></strong> (corkscrew, lit. '[you] pull-cork'), <strong><em>un ouvre-boîte</em></strong> (can opener, lit. '[you] open-can') or those with plural imperatives (like <strong><em>cache-cache</em></strong>, formally and semantically (almost) equivalent to English hide-and-seek, ) or <strong><em>laissez-faire</em></strong> (negligence, lit. '[you (pl)] let-to be'), <strong><em>laissez-passer</em></strong> (a pass, lit. you (pl)] let-to pass'). </p>\n\n<p>This principle proliferates in structures of compound verbs with imperatives regarded as nouns, e.g. <strong><em>cessez-le-feu</em></strong> (a truce; lit. '[you (pl)] ceize-the-fire), <strong><em>décrochez-moi-ça</em></strong> (ragged clothes; a rag shop, lit. 'give-me-this [item of clothes hanging]'), or even <strong><em>le va-et-vient</em></strong> (the coming and going, lit. 'the [(s)he] comes ans [(s)he] goes').</p>\n\n<p>2.Considering a verb as a form of action, we might regard some forms of Finnish and Estonian nouns as words-in-action, too, thus making such untypical (yet grammatical) structures as <strong><em>työhönmeno</em></strong> (to [active]work-going), <strong><em>poissaolo</em></strong> (absence. lit. 'away [stative]-being'), or <strong><em>maahanmuutto</em></strong> (immigration, lit. 'into land [active]-[causative] change') as specific examples of compound action-nouns.</p>\n\n<p>3.In Russian, there is a peculiar feature which could be best described as '[ad]verbal predicates' with verbs with a form which looks much like a 2nd person sg. imperative: <strong><em>Это просто не-пришей-козе-баян.</em></strong> = This is strange and ridiculous (lit. 'This is a sheer don't-you-sew-an-acordeon-on-a-sheegoat'). </p>\n\n<p>4.In Chinese, where a distinction between parts of speech is arbitrary and depends on a syntactical structure, the word is regarded as a verb or as a noun depending on its place within a phrase. Thus, <strong>是</strong> in <strong>这是啥？</strong>(What is this) is 'is', or 'to be'; yet, although <strong>就</strong> normally means 'suppling' or 'move' or 'at once', the combination of <strong>就是</strong> means 'exactly' or 'just like' rather than 'right-now-being' or 'being in a suppling motion'.</p>\n", "Id":"6267", "ParentId":"3950", "LastEditorUserId":"1686", "CreationDate":"2013-12-29T09:18:55.527", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-30T13:50:56.550", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"145", "DownVotes":"36", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ1Oc.jpg", "Id":"1686", "AccountId":"2130467", "Views":"63", "Reputation":"1112", "CreationDate":"2013-01-19T17:49:32.827", "DisplayName":"Manjusri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T20:17:27.900", "AboutMe":"<p>I have no native language.
