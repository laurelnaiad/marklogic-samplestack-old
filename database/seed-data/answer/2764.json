{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The above answers are all good.  I'd like to offer another perspective that I learned while teaching digital libraries that draws on the analogy used in biology:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Computational biology = the study of biology using computational techniques.  The goal is to learn new biology, knowledge about living sytems.  It is about science.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bioinformatics = the creation of tools (algorithms, databases) that solve problems.  The goal is to build useful tools that work on biological data.  It is about engineering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To make the analogy for any field X, we thus have \"Computational X\" and \"X-omatics\".  In NLP/CL, NLP is the equivalent of \"Linguamatics\".</p>\n\n<p>I don't really subscribe to the notion that CL encompasses NLP or vice versa.  They both have a purpose.  CL studies human language to computationally understand how we as humans have the capacity to produce and understand language.  NLP takes a more pragmatic perspective and says that we wish to build systems that facilitate some language interface.</p>\n", "Id":"2764", "ParentId":"1802", "CreationDate":"2012-10-27T14:42:43.433", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1446", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-27T14:42:43.433", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy", "Location":"Singapore", "Id":"1446", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1983412", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"41", "CreationDate":"2012-10-27T14:32:29.030", "DisplayName":"Min-Yen Kan", "LastAccessDate":"2013-01-07T04:21:47.997", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm an associate professor with research interests that span digital libraries, natural language processing and information retrieval. Specific interests include: scholarly digital libraries, definitional QA, statistical MT, text summarization, verb analysis, optimizing access to scientific literature, web crawling, and combining search and browsing user interfaces under human-computer interaction. I'm a senior member of the ACM, a member of the IEEE, ACL and PREMIA. I graduated with my Ph.D. from Columbia University.</p>\n"}}
