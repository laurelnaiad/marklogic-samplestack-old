Ignore the vowels just for now, and just focus on the 'p' sounds. If I were doing a <em>phonetic</em> transcription of English notice how all the 'p' sounds are different and they've got slightly different diacritics to show this:</p>\n\n<p>[pʰin]     'pin'   - notice it's aspirated!\n[spin]     'spin'  - notice it's not aspriated!\n[stop̚]     'stop'  - notice that you didn't actually open your mouth at the end.</p>\n\n<p>I use those square brackets to show it's phonetic - it's the sounds as they really and objectively are. But that's not how English speakers really think of them - they don't think of these sounds being different, they all just think of them as 'p.' to show this we just write them all as /p/ and use angle brackets to show that people think of them all as the one sound - /pin/, /spin/ and /stop/.</p>\n", "Id":"203", "ParentId":"180", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T01:07:39.963", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"64", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-16T01:07:39.963", "CommentCount":"1"}
