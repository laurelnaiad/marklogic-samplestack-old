Note that currently the script requires you to have the open paren adjacent to the last letter of the source text, but does allow for multiword source and target. I am open to any suggestions to improve this tool. Please note it is very basic but it gets the job done!</p>\n\n<p>PS: The current CSS is static, but could potentially be dynamic and based on user-supplied options. A later version? </p>\n", "Id":"46", "ParentId":"3", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:44:18.110", "Score":"13", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"16", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-13T23:44:18.110", "CommentCount":"2"}
