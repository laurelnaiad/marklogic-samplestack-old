{"Body":"<p>You can find the terms <em>copula</em> and <em>copular</em> defined in most linguistics dictionaries, and they are widely used in modern syntax textbooks (e.g. Radford 2004, Carnie 2013), so the brief answer to your question is yes, the term <em>copula</em> is still quite current. </p>\n\n<p>Where I think confusion arises about copulae in English concerns \"be\" in particular. Like other copulae (<em>become</em>, <em>taste</em>, <em>feel</em>, <em>look</em>, etc.), <em>be</em> takes a predicative expression as its complement, but unlike these other copulae, copula <em>be</em> behaves like an auxiliary verb:</p>\n\n<p>It allows subject-auxiliary inversion:\na. <em>Fred is hungry.</em>\nb. <em>Is Fred hungry?</em></p>\n\n<p>It takes <em>not</em> as a postdependent:\na. <em>Fred is hungry.</em>\nb. <em>Fred is not hungry.</em></p>\n\n<p>It licenses VP-ellipsis:\na. <em>Susan is hungry, and Fred is hungry, too.</em>\nb. <em>Susan is hungry, and Fred is, too.</em> </p>\n\n<p>What this all means is that copula <em>be</em> has the status of an auxiliary verb. In other words, it is both a copula and an auxiliary verb. I think many linguistics texts fail to acknowledge this trait of copula <em>be</em>. They tacitly assume that copulae are not auxiliary verbs. While that is true of most copulae in English, it is not true of <em>be</em>, which is by far the most frequently occurring copula in the language.   </p>\n", "Id":"6019", "ParentId":"5979", "LastEditorUserId":"2247", "CreationDate":"2013-11-27T18:26:55.333", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-27T18:34:49.583", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2247", "AccountId":"3045491", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"565", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T16:52:54.170", "DisplayName":"Tim Osborne", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T04:26:20.267"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-27T18:34:49.583", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2247", "AccountId":"3045491", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"565", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T16:52:54.170", "DisplayName":"Tim Osborne", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T04:26:20.267"}}
