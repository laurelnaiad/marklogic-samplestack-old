Anyone who uses the term \"verb-second\" would agree with this, I believe.</p>\n\n<p>The Wikipedia page you link to actually gives examples of SV order as a type of verb-second order: e.g. the very first example, from German, which it says \"illustrates the V2 principle\": <em>Die Kinder  spielten    Fussball    vor der Schule  im Park.</em></p>\n\n<p>Maybe what misled you is that that page says that English has moved from a V2 to a broadly SV order, which might be taken to suggest that SV is something entirely different from V2. But the point is that SV, as the most frequent type of V2, has become the basic unmarked word order in English, while other types of V2 -- in which the verb was preceded by e.g. an adverb, a PP, or an object, and the subject then followed the verb -- have mostly fallen out of use.</p>\n", "Id":"6355", "ParentId":"6347", "CreationDate":"2014-01-09T03:06:16.010", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-09T03:06:16.010", "CommentCount":"4"}
