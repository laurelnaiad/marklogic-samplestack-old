Norway is called \"An Iorua\". Italy is \"An Iodáil\". The Netherlands are called \"An Ísiltír\" (The low country).

England is Sasainn. Ireland is Èirinn. Scotland is Alba. Cornwall is \"A’ Chòrn\" (The horn).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>In Manx Gaelic:</strong> Wales is called \"Bretyn\" and Brittany is called \"Yn Vritaan\". England is \"Sostyn\". Ireland is Nerin. Scotland is Nalbin. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>In Welsh:</strong> Ireland is called \"Iwerddon\" and Scotland \"Yr Alban\". England is called \"Lloegr\" (the British name for the south east of Britain). </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So England is \"Land of Angles\" in English, \"Land of Saxons\" in Gaelic and a part of ancient Britain, called Lloegr, in Welsh. </p>\n\n<p>The word \"Ireland\", \"Irland\" or \"Irlanda\" stem from Éire, its Gaelic name.</p>\n\n<p>Scotland is \"Alba\" in Gaelic, which was historically applied to all of Britain, if I'm not mistaken. And \"Scot\" was a Roman word used with respect to the Irish. Later, with the gaelification of Scotland, the term became associated with the modern day Scots.</p>\n\n<p>Wales is referred to as \"The Little Britain\" in Scots Gaelic since the Welsh are descendants of the native British, with Wales representing a smaller version of the original Britain. In Irish \"The Little Britain\" is associated instead with Brittany since this country was originally a colony created by native Britons fleeing the Germanic invasion of Britain. </p>\n", "Id":"4430", "ParentId":"3996", "LastEditorUserId":"1835", "CreationDate":"2013-09-12T09:15:13.503", "OwnerUserId":"1835", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-12T09:40:29.683", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-12T09:40:29.683", "Score":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"18", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"1835", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EErPs.jpg", "AccountId":"300614", "Views":"9", "Reputation":"81", "CreationDate":"2013-03-08T16:01:23.670", "DisplayName":"Baz", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:13:07.010", "AboutMe":""}}
