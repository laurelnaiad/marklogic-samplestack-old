{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>[Note: I am not an L1 acquisition specialist.]</p>\n\n<p>Although in public nearly all linguists will say “languages are basically equivalent and children learn them at about the same rate”, this is actually something of a little white lie. In my experience, linguists who work on Athabaskan languages will, after a few drinks, admit that the languages they study can’t possibly be learned at the same rate as say English or Swahili. The morphological complexity in these languages seems to be well beyond what is reasonable for children to fully acquire in the space of twelveish years. Unfortunately there has been almost no research done at all on first language acquisition of the languages in the Athabaskan family, at least partly because most of them lack first language acquirers nowdays.</p>\n\n<p>Even for Athabaskan languages with new native speakers, like Navajo and Dëne Sųłiné/Chipewyan, there aren’t researchers studying their acquisition, so we can’t ask for empirical studies of this issue. But native speakers, particularly native speaker linguists, will affirm that there are parts of the grammar of the language that took a very long time for them to learn. Not vocabulary, which we know continues to be acquired through adulthood in basically every language, but actually <i>grammar</i> in the sense of morphosyntax, morphosemantics, and morphophonology. One example of a difficult phenomenon in this family is something variously called ‘superaspect’, ‘subaspect’, or ‘epiaspect’, whereby a fully conjugated verb that has person, situation aspect, viewpoint aspect, voice, plurality, duration, realis, lexical class, object shape, manner, distributivity, spatial disposition, and so forth all packed into it can then be stuck back into the conjugation system again to produce a verb that is conjugated for temporal properties <i>twice</i>. The result is that a verb can be on the one hand a ‘semelfactive occasional perfective’ and <i>also</i> be a ‘progressive habitual’ (“he would always occasionally be tapping his finger once” or something like that) with marking for both scattered discontinuously throughout the verb. Children seem to be unable or unwilling to produce such verbs and apparently have a hard time understanding them, usually only getting part of the temporal information. (With the more moribund languages, the problem of partial acquisition gets in the way here.) This phenomenon of incomplete early acquisition is regardless of exposure, since children in the various Athabaskan cultures usually get plenty of exposure to oratory and narrative where these complicated forms are often used.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all of this complexity is in the morphology, either in morphophonology, or morphosemantics, or morphosyntax. It isn’t the case that other areas pose problems for temporal limits on acquisition, so that complete acquisition of syntax and of phonology seems to finish just like with other less gnarly languages. Only in the morphology does the Athabaskan family exhibit this prolonged acquisition requirement. In a sense, at least part of the grammar of these languages is actually an art or a craft rather than being a semi-innate function of human minds. Where the individual linguist draws the line between these parts of a language is unresolved, mostly because most linguists tend to ignore it or only speak about it in hushed tones over alcoholic beverages.</p>\n\n<p>I eagerly await empirical studies that confirm or deny my and other Athabaskanists private hunches about the acquisition of these languages. Unfortunately nobody has stood up for the challenge yet.</p>\n", "Id":"1041", "ParentId":"778", "CreationDate":"2011-11-17T02:42:44.600", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"511", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-17T02:42:44.600", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"30", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.drangle.com/~james", "Id":"511", "AccountId":"513739", "CreationDate":"2011-11-16T02:03:12.387", "AboutMe":"<p>I’m a PhD student in linguistics at the University of British Columbia.
