{"Body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph\" rel=\"nofollow\">Homograph</a>. Literally \"same spelling\". Any two words with different meanings which are spelled the same regardless of their pronunciation (it could be the same or it could be different. It doesn't matter).</p>\n\n<p>Taking the discussion of abjad to it's logical conclusion, I see no reason why this term couldn't be extended to even completely non-phonetic writing systems. I can easily imagine some Chinese-like ideograph which represents two separate concepts (perhaps with the same pronunciation or not). Since they are orthographically identical I'd still consider them homographs.</p>\n", "Id":"3088", "ParentId":"3077", "LastEditorUserId":"1055", "CreationDate":"2013-01-18T05:36:43.953", "OwnerUserId":"1055", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-18T08:36:21.777", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"102", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Seoul, South Korea", "Id":"1055", "DownVotes":"9", "AccountId":"1453460", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"1947", "CreationDate":"2012-05-29T05:50:57.073", "DisplayName":"acattle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:59:41.983", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently studying for an MA in Computational Linguistics even though my background is not in linguistics.
