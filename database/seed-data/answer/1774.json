{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Some Iranian languages have both prepositions and postpositions. <a href=\"http://languageserver.uni-graz.at/ls/art?id=2649\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stilo (1987)</a> suggests that this is so because these languages lie in a \"buffer zone,\" or they\nare at the boundary between two linguistic areas, one where prepositions are common, and one where postpositions are common. There are also Uralic languages which have both prepositions and postpositions (see <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=QTU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=uralic%20prepositions%20postpositions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RjODT-SEEOf50gH6sdXqBw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=uralic%20prepositions%20postpositions&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comrie 1981: 121</a> for an example from Estonian), and there is good reason to believe that this is also a \"buffer zone\" effect (see the map on p. 7 of the <a href=\"http://exadmin.matita.net/uploads/pagine/219206430_dunnH.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2011 handout by Matthew Dryer</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I think Stilo's proposal for accounting for \"mixed type\" languages is quite plausible intuitively, and I have no problems believing that mixed adposition profiles are common in language contact situations, but it would be nice to see more comprehensive studies.</p>\n", "Id":"1774", "ParentId":"1762", "CreationDate":"2012-04-09T19:16:29.063", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-09T19:16:29.063", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
