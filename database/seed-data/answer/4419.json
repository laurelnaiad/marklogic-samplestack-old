{"Body":"<p><em>I'm sure I've read the following idea written by a linguist somewhere. I didn't manage to find the reference and I'd love to have serious references for that. The following is mainly a first person description of my native language's grammar, on an aspect which is not taught at school, but seems obvious in retrospect.</em></p>\n\n<p>Such an indigenous language is my native modern French ! The tense corresponding to mythological/ancestral past is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass%C3%A9_simple\" rel=\"nofollow\">passé simple</a> (<a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass%C3%A9_simple\" rel=\"nofollow\">French Wikipedia link, with more details, but in French</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Basically, this past tense was used for distant past event (older than 24h) in the 18<sup>th</sup> century but totally disappeared from oral speech by the beginning og the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It stayed in formal writing, and by now only appears in old text and fairy tales. For example, when my 8 years old niece invents a fairy tale, it is at the passé simple tense, and it is the only occasion she ever uses this tense.</p>\n", "Id":"4419", "ParentId":"3109", "LastEditorUserId":"120", "CreationDate":"2013-09-10T16:49:56.690", "OwnerUserId":"120", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-09-10T17:00:27.687", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"78", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.lac.u-psud.fr/spip.php?rubrique256", "Id":"120", "AccountId":"112131", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:29:11.410", "AboutMe":"<p>Researcher in quantum information, mainly on cryptography.</p>\n", "Age":"38", "Location":"Paris, France", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"222", "DisplayName":"Frédéric Grosshans", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-26T17:11:29.637"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-10T17:00:27.687", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"78", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.lac.u-psud.fr/spip.php?rubrique256", "Id":"120", "AccountId":"112131", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:29:11.410", "AboutMe":"<p>Researcher in quantum information, mainly on cryptography.</p>\n", "Age":"38", "Location":"Paris, France", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"222", "DisplayName":"Frédéric Grosshans", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-26T17:11:29.637"}}
