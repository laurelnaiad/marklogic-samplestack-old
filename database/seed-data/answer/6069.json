Those rules are still taught by some in introductory linguistics courses, and they seem to still be accepted by many in computational linguistics. Theoretical syntax, however, progressed beyond those rules decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>The confusion with the examples you are considering stems from the status of AUX. My guess is that the person who wrote the notes does not view the copula <em>be</em> as an AUX. What this means is that for the author of those notes, a sentence such as <em>John is tall</em> does not contain an auxiliary. The copula is construed as a main verb, which means the VP is <em>is tall</em>. So there is no reason to introduce a new phrase structure rule to cover such cases. </p>\n\n<p>I want to emphasize that those old phrase structure rules will not get you very far when it comes to building an understanding of the syntactic structure of sentences. What happens to the VP, for instance, when subject-auxiliary inversion occurs, e.g.  <em>Is John tall?</em> </p>\n", "Id":"6069", "ParentId":"6068", "CreationDate":"2013-12-04T17:37:22.353", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-04T17:37:22.353", "CommentCount":"13"}
