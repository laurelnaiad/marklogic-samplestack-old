{"Body":"<p>Edit: Since I got a downvote, I reworded my question to better reflect my original intent.</p>\n\n<p>You are right in claiming that there is (very probably) no \"pure\" ergative language (although some, such as Dyirbal, come close).</p>\n\n<p>But then also consider that there is possibly no true accusative languages as well. While English certainly aligns fundamentally, accusatively, there are some constructions that are sensitive to other distinctions than subject/object.</p>\n\n<p>Past participles are one such example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>*The sung choir (A)</li>\n<li>*The eaten glutton (Sa)</li>\n<li>The fallen leaves (Sp)</li>\n<li>The hunted rabbit (P)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Past participles can only ever refer to objects (P) or affected intransitive subjects (Sp).</p>\n\n<p>This particular instance of alignment found in English participles (which some call \"split intransitivity\") is actually the way normal sentences work in languages such as Lakhota or Guaran√≠.</p>\n\n<p>So the true answer is: there is no pure accusative/ergative/split-intransitive language, but linguists, as anyone, need labels for effective communication. That's why we use such convenient descriptions such as \"ergative language\".</p>\n", "Id":"3993", "ParentId":"3992", "LastEditorUserId":"1380", "CreationDate":"2013-07-11T15:30:50.747", "OwnerUserId":"1380", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-15T01:30:17.700", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"1380", "AccountId":"1907225", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"529", "CreationDate":"2012-10-05T03:06:16.113", "DisplayName":"Fryie", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T09:48:02.760", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"26"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-15T01:30:17.700", "Score":"-1", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"5", "Id":"1380", "AccountId":"1907225", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"529", "CreationDate":"2012-10-05T03:06:16.113", "DisplayName":"Fryie", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T09:48:02.760", "AboutMe":"", "Age":"26"}}
