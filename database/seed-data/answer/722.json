{"Body":"<p>This relationship is called <strong>polysemy</strong>: when one meaning tends to be so close to another meaning that the word for one is generally co-opted as the word for another.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most reliable examples of polysemy is container polysemy. The idea is that a container is so closely associated with its contents that we can use the term for the container to refer to its contents. Here's a minimal pair:    </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I broke the bottle of wine.</li>\n<li>I drank the bottle of wine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Only the glass container can be the object of <em>break</em>; only the liquid inside can be the object of <em>drink</em>.)</p>\n", "Id":"722", "ParentId":"620", "LastEditorUserId":"273", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T16:35:03.000", "OwnerUserId":"394", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-11T05:54:29.413", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "WebsiteUrl":"http://english.stackexchange.com/users/13088/kazark", "Id":"273", "AccountId":"443137", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T20:50:52.200", "AboutMe":"<p>I love language because <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/084231413X\" rel=\"nofollow\">He is not silent</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/443137\">\n<img src=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/443137.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Kazark on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Kazark on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>The birthdate I entered is farcical, as I prefer not to identify myself in any way online, but the age is in the ballpark.</sub></p>\n", "Age":"25", "Location":"ho äm", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"4", "Reputation":"204", "DisplayName":"Kazark", "LastAccessDate":"2012-12-17T16:14:36.740"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-11T05:54:29.413", "Score":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"394", "AccountId":"957547", "Views":"5", "Reputation":"221", "CreationDate":"2011-10-06T16:30:41.020", "DisplayName":"Semanticist", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-11T02:37:42.403", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a semantics professor at an American research university.</p>\n"}}
