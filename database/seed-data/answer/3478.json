This means doing something that gives the impression of one's being absorbed in thought. Since there is no standard behavioral accompaniment for <em>think</em>, this could be almost anything; Rodin certainly chose a common behavior to depict, but there are plenty of others.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, there is the active process of consideration before decision, as in </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>I'm thinking about it; give me a minute, OK?</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And also various active phrasal verbs and idioms</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>He's overthinking his business plan.</em></li>\n<li><em>Think it over/through; you'll see.</em></li>\n<li><em>You'll have to think up a new logo.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But none of these are the mental stative sense of <em>think</em>, as in </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>I think it's a bad idea.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This, however, <strong>can</strong> be made into a progressive inchoative, as in</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>I'm beginning/coming to think it's a bad idea.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and that in turn can be shortened by simply making <em>think</em> progressive</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>I'm thinking it's a bad idea.</em></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"3478", "ParentId":"3474", "CreationDate":"2013-03-31T20:40:17.690", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-31T20:40:17.690", "CommentCount":"4"}
