{"Body":"<p>It is worth noting, I think, that \"article\" is not a theoretical primitive in (most if not all) contemporary generative theories of syntax.  A generative syntactician would say that languages have larger or smaller inventories of determiners (e.g. <em>this</em>, <em>that</em>; this is the category from which <em>the</em> developed) and quantifiers (e.g. <em>one</em>, <em>many</em>, <em>no</em>; this is the category from which <em>a(n)</em> developed).  However, articles are a notion of classical grammar and are definitionally restricted to the definite and indefinite.  </p>\n\n<p>(Some grammarians might include more kinds of articles, as <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Article_%28grammar%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Wikipedia article on articles</a> does.  But this reflects more a taxonomic whim of the analyst than a fact about language.)</p>\n", "Id":"70", "ParentId":"16", "LastEditorUserId":"46", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T04:48:04.490", "OwnerUserId":"46", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-14T05:47:47.623", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
