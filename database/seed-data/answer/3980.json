Hearing a common word can lead many people to THINK they know what it means, and be slightly wrong, whereas a word they don't know will have to be defined, and can therefore be defined precisely.</p>\n\n<p>In your examples, \"desist\" means more than just stop.  It means something like \"stop, and don't start again, and don't do anything else so similar that we can show it has the same effect\".  This is why the letter you send to someone using your intellectual property is called a \"cease and desist\" letter, rather than just a cease letter.</p>\n\n<p>Parity, on the other hand, is slightly less specific than equality.  It suggests equality in one specific way, or mere connectedness, rather than actual equality.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know enough about medicine to know the specific meaning of onset, but it is highly likely that it is slightly different to \"start\".</p>\n\n<p>Even if you choose a word to represent something that is already accurately contained within a word in common usage, if the concept is important within the profession in question, it is likely that a jargon word may be coined in order to avoid the word's meaning migrating over time, as words in common use are wont to do.</p>\n", "Id":"3980", "ParentId":"3973", "CreationDate":"2013-07-08T18:17:22.400", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2008", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-08T18:17:22.400", "CommentCount":"3"}
