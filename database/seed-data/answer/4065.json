(Volume II, Complex Constructions)</p>\n\n<p>The semantic difference between normal coordination with “and” and emphatic coordination with “both…and” is that, in the latter, the separateness of the referents of the two coordinands is emphasized.   </p>\n\n<p>So, for example, “Both Wyoming and Wisconsin are in the USA,” emphasizes that, though both states are in the USA, logically neither <em>or only one</em> of the states might have been in the USA.   </p>\n\n<p>[I would add that emphasis on the separateness of Wyoming and Wisconsin might also be achieved by stressing \"and\":   Wyoming AND Wisconsin are in the USA.]</p>\n\n<p>The text I cite here points out that the sentence “Spanish and Portuguese are similar,” is felicitous, but the sentence “*Both Spanish and Portuguese are similar,” is infelicitous “because two things cannot be separately similar.”  (The latter quote is on p. 55 of the book I mentioned above.)  </p>\n\n<p>These considerations apply to your examples.   \"Bob and Alice ate lunch,\" presupposes that both, one, or neither might have eaten lunch.   But \"Both Bob and Alice ate lunch\" emphasizes the possibility that only one might have eaten lunch.</p>\n", "Id":"4065", "ParentId":"4063", "CreationDate":"2013-07-26T19:02:28.507", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"790", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-26T19:02:28.507", "CommentCount":"2"}
