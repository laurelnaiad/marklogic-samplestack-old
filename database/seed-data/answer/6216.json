My current focuses are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>Italian and German for the best possible score in my high school studies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I love Linguistics and Maths too, however I'm more passionate about the former. I guess you could also say I enjoy computer programming, however again I'm not the biggest enthusiast.</p>\n", "Age":"17", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"121", "DisplayName":"Ledda", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T22:16:36.293"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>I say this a lot. Like Hippietrail said, it's a progression from the dark l.\nI can say  as [wɫ̩] when it's used as a discourse particle. My dialect tends to turn a syllable final velarized [ɫ] into [w]. As a result, I VERY often say [wː] instead of [wɛɫ]. I can record it if you like.</p>\n\n<p>That aside, the way it progresses from a dark l to a [w] or a [ʊ], depending on your perspective (is it a syllabic consonant, or a vowel? lol) is because the mouth shape for [ɫ] is almost exactly the same for [w] except the apex of the tongue is touching the alveolar ridge. As soon as the tip lets go, it sounds like [w] and not [ɫ].</p>\n\n<p>In case you don't know, [ɫ] is an /l/ with the back of the tongue velarized. That is, it's nearing the velum (where you produce /k/ and /g/). </p>\n\n<p>As for the name of this phonological process? I haven't the faintest idea. De-alveolarisation, maybe? Haha, maybe not. </p>\n", "Id":"6216", "ParentId":"6214", "CreationDate":"2013-12-21T23:59:21.233", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2850", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-21T23:59:21.233", "CommentCount":"1"}
