{"Body":"<p>It is all very simple, there is a marvellous Esperanto <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_voice#Middle\" rel=\"nofollow\">middle voice</a> derivational suffix <code>-iĝ-</code> which makes every root passive (at least from the point of view of an English speaker). Followed by the infinitive suffix <code>-i</code> (<code>-iĝi</code>) it forms passive infinitives:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>fari - \"to do/make\"</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fari%C4%9Di\" rel=\"nofollow\">fariĝi</a> - \"to be done/made\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note, that making passives with this suffix lies in the sphere of derivation, word building, and not in the sphere of conjugation, that can be the reason you haven't at once remembered about it as a passive suffix.</p>\n", "Id":"6163", "ParentId":"6162", "LastEditorUserId":"2689", "CreationDate":"2013-12-16T01:17:18.360", "OwnerUserId":"2689", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-16T13:20:29.513", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "Location":"Ukraine", "DownVotes":"12", "Id":"2689", "AccountId":"2118122", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"828", "CreationDate":"2013-11-06T08:33:33.413", "DisplayName":"Yellow Sky", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:45:10.363", "AboutMe":"<p>I've been working as a teacher of English and German for more than 10 years already.
