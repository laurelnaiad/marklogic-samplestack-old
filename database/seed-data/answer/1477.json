When words that syntactically belong together stand close to each other, the sentence is easier to understand than when they are far apart.</li>\n<li><strong>Emphasis</strong>. A word placed in a prominent position within a sentence -- such as the first word of the sentence -- is emphasized.</li>\n<li>Formation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_figure\"><strong>Rhetorical Figures</strong></a>. An alliteration, for example, is easily formed if you can freely rearrange the words in a sentence.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_%28Latin%29\"><strong>Poetic Prosody</strong></a>: Latin poetry doesn't rhyme, it builds rhythmical patterns instead.
