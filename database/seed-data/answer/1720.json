{"OwnerDisplayName":"user325", "Body":"<p>Preliminarily, I've found in Nevins 2007 five examples which have PCC and inclusive-exclusive, and this distinction never plays a role in conditioning PCC effects. Nevins argues this is because [addressee] (the feature distinguishing inc/exc) is privative. Since his theoretical framework (multiple agree) permits only marked or contrastive features can play a role in PCC, and only binary features can be marked or contrastive, [addressee] is not expected to play any role.
