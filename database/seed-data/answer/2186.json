This produces a fairly normal profile of phonetic vowel variation (\"normal\", at least, for a NW Caucasian language), but only requires that the <strong>positions</strong> of the vowels be marked phonemically, since all their phonetic features are predictable from their position among surrounding consonants.</p>\n\n<p>This is an extreme case, and there was a big debate on the subject; the final outcome seems to be that there are now <strong>three</strong> phonemic vowels recognized in Kabardian, sort of like PIE laryngeals.
