In Hebrew the fruit \"orange\" is a new idea, and thus has a new word. However, instead of calling it by the colour orange (which would be כתום \"Katom\" in Hebrew) we call it a תפוז \"tapuz\" which is a portmanteau of \"golden apple\". So the fruit is in fact named after a colour, but not the colour of it's peel.</p>\n", "Id":"1096", "ParentId":"620", "CreationDate":"2011-11-30T21:54:28.367", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"536", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-30T21:54:28.367", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"41", "WebsiteUrl":"http://dotancohen.com", "DownVotes":"2", "Id":"536", "AccountId":"138391", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"334", "CreationDate":"2011-11-26T22:40:44.440", "DisplayName":"dotancohen", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-09T13:42:03.957", "Age":"37"}}
