{"Body":"<p>There has long been a secret war in the phonetics community: lets call the two camps \"articulators\" and \"acoustics\". As the names imply, there are two competing ways of describing vowels: what the mouth does (position of tongue, jaw, shape and position of lips etc., this is reflected in the IPA) and what the vowel sounds like, which is visible in a spectrogram for instance. With the latter one uses the formants to map the sound into a vowel diagram, and funnily enough if you connect the dots it still looks like a skewed square! These days, measuring how the mouth articulates a sound is hopefully done with for instance an MRI-machine and not the old way, which includes mirrors, videocameras, painting the mouth, very strong x-rays, casts of the mouth etc. Being a phonetics informant in the old days could be dangerous to your health. Analysing the sound is dirt cheap in comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Without knowing which method was used you can't really compare vowel diagrams.</p>\n", "Id":"141", "ParentId":"137", "LastEditorUserId":"119", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T20:18:57.360", "OwnerUserId":"119", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-14T21:42:55.600", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T21:42:55.600", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
