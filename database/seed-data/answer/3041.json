All other languages either use ideograms (hyerogliphs) for writing or use alphabetic/syllabary spelling that can be read following certain rules.</p>\n\n<p>English is unique in that while it uses usual letters, it has no general reading rules that could lead a reader to unambiguous pronunciation. A reader of English reads not single letters or syllables, but the whole words at once: to learn reading in English one has to remember the reading and spelling of the whole words. In this quality English is close to hyerogliphic languages where the reader or writer has to remember pictures for the whole words. Although words in English are formally composed of letters, they do not play a similar role as in other languages, rather they are used as parts of a word's picture which should be remembered as a whole.</p>\n", "Id":"3041", "ParentId":"2427", "CreationDate":"2013-01-06T22:10:26.340", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"624", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-06T22:10:26.340", "CommentCount":"9"}
