{"Body":"<p>If Hebrew is really an Indo-European language due to contact with Indo-European then English is a Romance language due to Norman French and a ton of loans from Latin. What nonsense. Languages don't go about changing what family they descend from. English certainly is not a continuation of Norman French!</p>\n\n<p>You can make a new language through creolization, is this Zuckermann claiming that Hebrew is a creole? Dixon's punctuated equilibrium model (see \"The Rise and Fall of Languages\") doesn't explain Hebrew either as it needs more time and several languages to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are some that consider Modern Hebrew to be a naturalized conlang (constructed language that has become a natural language through use). If that is the case it doesn't really descend from anything.</p>\n", "Id":"215", "ParentId":"89", "LastEditorUserId":"119", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T10:18:39.483", "OwnerUserId":"119", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-24T13:42:25.353", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-24T13:42:25.353", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
