Linguists disagree about exactly how they should be\n  characterized, but several intriguing proposals have been made (for a\n  partial review, see Frawley, 1992, pp. 480--496). At the very outset,\n  it is important to note that most of the ordering patterns found in\n  English have also been observed in a variety of other languages that\n  have prenominal adjective order---e.g., German, Hungarian, Polish,\n  Turkish, Amharic, Hindi, Telugu, Chinese, and Japanese---and the mirror\n  images of these patterns appear in a variety of languages with\n  postnominal adjective sequences---e.g., Chichewa, Basque, Persian,\n  Indonesian, and Qiang (Dixon, 1982; Hetzron, 1978; LaPolla &amp; Huang,\n  2004; Martin, 1969b). Because many of these languages are\n  geographically, historically, and typologically quite distant from\n  each other, no mutual inﬂuences need be suspected, thus raising the\n  possibility that the most commonly attested ordering patterns, such as\n  the ``value > size > color’’ hierarchy, reﬂect universal cognitive\n  predispositions for mapping descriptive semantic properties onto\n  linear syntactic positions.2</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"1609", "ParentId":"1607", "CreationDate":"2012-03-09T16:36:48.750", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-09T16:36:48.750", "CommentCount":"1"}
