{"Body":"<p>I don't know enough to recommend textbooks on psycholinguistics, but how about this course page: <a href=\"http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/experimental_psycholinguistics_2011/schedule.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/experimental_psycholinguistics_2011/schedule.php</a>?</p>\n\n<p>I saw Otavio's comment only today. Here is the course description:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The current course will give an overview of experimental methods in psycholinguistics including the following areas: Description of different state-of-the-art methods, various experimental designs, analyses tools and evaluation of findings. Students will gather hands-on experience of all stages of experimental research by designing and running experiments themselves, learning basics of the statistical software R in order to conduct statistical modeling of the results as well as learning to present the results in the standard format of the experimental research reports. </p>\n  \n  <p>Evaluation based on experimental work, active participation in lectures and the final research report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"827", "ParentId":"813", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2011-10-16T13:25:02.673", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-02T05:03:27.517", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-02T05:03:27.517", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
