{"comments":[], "Body":"<p><strong>Number</strong> in language is a big subject, much too big for a single answer on a site like this. I recommend you find the book <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/no/knowledge/isbn/item1160529/Number/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Number\" by G. G. Corbett</a>, which I think gives a good overview. It is not exhaustive (I doubt any book on a scientific topic ever can be) but it is very clearly written and a fast read. Just skimming the table of contents is an eye opener.</p>\n\n<p>It's been years since I read it, but IIRC it discusses things like trial and tertial number (for things that come in threes or fours) and whether these really exist, paucal (few, countable) as opposed to plural (many, uncountable) systems, some that also include duals (things that come in twos, not that uncommon a number actually), count versus mass, where number is expressed (on nouns? verbs? pronouns? adjectives? etc.), how it is expressed (clitic? affix? separate word? change of tone, stress?), what sort of reduced systems the author has found (reduced=missing number, e.g dual for people but not things, plural marked in the present tense but not any other tense) etc. etc. Number, like all things I've ever looked into when it comes to language, is big, complex, and beautiful.</p>\n", "Id":"3463", "ParentId":"3450", "CreationDate":"2013-03-29T20:34:35.063", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2013-03-29T20:34:35.063", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
