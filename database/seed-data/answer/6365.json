{"Body":"<p>I already answerred it, so this is a copy of my <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/2878/624\">previous answer</a>:</p>\n\n<p>There was the agent suffix -ter- of PIE. It was used for creation of terms for relatives and for creation of agent nouns. </p>\n\n<p>Suffix -ter- was used to create a noun for person whose function or profession was to perform the action (irrespective whether he actually did it) while the o-grade of it -tor- was used to denote a person who just did the action. The combination of suffixes -a̯-ter- was used for some relatives.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the term for daughter in PIE was <strong><em>dhuga̯tēr</em></strong> (ġ means uvular g).</p>\n\n<p>The same suffix in zero-grade, \"-tr-\" in combination with inanimate ending \"-om\" was used for creating words for tools, such as <strong><em>a̯ero̯trom</em></strong> \"plow\", <strong><em>u̯estrom</em></strong> \"wear\", <strong><em>tere̯trom</em></strong> \"auger\", <strong><em>costrom</em></strong> \"knife\". </p>\n\n<p>By the way, of course, the PIE superlative -ter-os was also another use of the same suffix. Thus  \"gela̯teros\" would mean \"more joyful\". The word \"enter\" (from Latin <em>intra-</em>) is another example of use of this suffix with adverbs: <strong><em>e̯en</em></strong> \"in\" + \"-ter-om\" -> <strong><em>e̯enterom</em></strong> \"intestines\", of which locative case is <strong><em>e̯enteri</em></strong> \"inside\".</p>\n\n<p>The English suffex -er does not have anything in connection, it is believed to be borrowed from Latin -arius.</p>\n", "Id":"6365", "ParentId":"6362", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2014-01-10T06:17:52.790", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2014-01-11T00:53:51.163", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-11T00:53:51.163", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
