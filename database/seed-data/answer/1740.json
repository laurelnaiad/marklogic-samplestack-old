I would characterize this as straddling the line between computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and education/testing theory. For example, a recent text on the subject is Shermis and Burnstein's <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=JIR6ihd7ZA4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Automated%20Essay%20Scoring%3a%20A%20Cross-disciplinary%20Perspective&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lGJ6T5LEIeTv0gH67viGBA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Automated%20Essay%20Scoring%3a%20A%20Cross-disciplinary%20Perspective&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Automated Essay Scoring: A Cross-disciplinary Perspective</a>. So this question is actually incredibly broad in scope.</p>\n\n<p>There are also existing systems that perform such analysis, notably <a href=\"https://criterion.ets.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ETS's Criterion system</a>.  A <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/assets/PDF/AIMag25-03-004.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">complete description of that system</a> can be found in the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence site. The approach is a little different than what you seem to assume in your question. It is statistical in nature; it doesn't parse the grammatical structure of the essays but rather compares characteristics of the essays to corpora of common bigrams (2-word strings) and essays with known scores. Analysis and scoring is performed using AI decision-making and voting algorithms. </p>\n", "Id":"1740", "ParentId":"1547", "CreationDate":"2012-04-03T03:06:30.713", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"537", "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-03T03:06:30.713", "CommentCount":"0"}
