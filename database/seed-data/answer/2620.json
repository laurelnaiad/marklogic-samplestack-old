{"Body":"<p>There's a book called <em>The Sounds of Korean</em> [1] with an accompanying CD which is invaluable for getting the phonetic distinctions right.</p>\n\n<p>Mechanical snail is right in that the distinction is being lost, particular among the young. However, in speakers who maintain the distinction, it sounds like a lowered [e]. I had a little look on <a href=\"http://www.forvo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forvo</a> for examples of speakers who maintain the distinction, but all the ones I checked were from people who merged the distinction.</p>\n\n<p>As for basic minimal pairs, explain to your friends that you're interested in the difference between 새 (<em>new</em>) and 세 (combining form of 셋), and they should be able to come up with more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I have a few more minimal pairs for you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>게 <em>crab</em> vs 개 <em>dog</em></li>\n<li>세 집 <em>three houses</em> vs 새 집 <em>new house</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The book also observes that while the distinction is not reliably made by many speakers', there is consistency when romanising English words: English [æ] is reliably mapped to ㅐ while [eI] and [E] are mapped to ㅔ.</p>\n\n<p>[1] Choo and O'Grady. <em>The Sounds of Korean</em>.
