{"Body":"<p>A sound change can only be \"regular\" with respect to a particular language. There are sound changes in languages which seem completely off the wall to me, but are \"regular\" in the sense that they are consistent with the diachronic evidence (i.e. the forms in a daughter language can be derived regularly from rules applied to a mother language). As such there is no list of \"regular sound changes\", where a sound change is somehow impossible if it is not in the list.</p>\n\n<p>As for the body of your question, [n] and [l] are said to be in <em>free variation</em> in Cantonese, which means that they are used interchangeably by native speakers, who consider both pronunciations acceptable. There are also some socio-linguistic factors involved — the [l] pronunciation is associated with female speech.</p>\n\n<p>[Incidentally, I personally say nei5 for 你 'you', but loeng4 instead of the \"correct\" noeng4 for the word 娘 'young girl'. This particular pair of pronunciations is very much in flux at the moment, and Cantonese may eventually shift largely to one pronunciation over time. Cantonese used to distinguish retroflex [ʂ] from apical [s] (e.g. 傷 shoeng1 'wound' vs 相 soeng1 'mutual'), but that distinction too has gradually been erased over the last 50-100 years.]</p>\n\n<p>An example of a quirky sound change, and I really do enjoy these, is from Taishanese, a Chinese topolect which, like Cantonese, is also spoken in Guangdong:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>t -> ∅ / #_</p>\n  \n  <p>b -> ∅ / #_</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"1643", "ParentId":"1642", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "CreationDate":"2012-03-15T10:01:44.327", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-15T10:13:11.893", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
