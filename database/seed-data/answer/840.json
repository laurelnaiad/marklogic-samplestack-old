In comparison to all the sounds humans make, these sequences are very rare.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's it. In fact the vast majority of linguistically produced sequences are so arbitrary and so distant from imitation, that there is no specialword for the larger set of non-onomatopoeic words. And there is no real 'in-between' stage of 'somewhat sounding like the thing it stands for, but not quite', because onomatopoeia includes that too. For example, in a bee buzzing, have you ever heard a voiced bilabial stop? That is 'in between' but is still considered onomatopoeia. </p>\n", "Id":"840", "ParentId":"839", "CreationDate":"2011-10-18T01:43:32.140", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"4", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-18T01:43:32.140", "CommentCount":"2"}
