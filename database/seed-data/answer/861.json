I figure if all goes well, I'll be teaching Intro to Linguistics once a year for the rest of my life, and I may as well get good at it.</p>\n", "Age":"33", "Location":"Austin, TX", "DownVotes":"7", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"2968", "DisplayName":"Dan Velleman", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-24T15:27:53.380"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>One interesting source of information comes from what old prescriptive grammarians found to gripe about.</p>\n\n<p>Every now and then you'll see someone write something like \"It's very bad to use the form X.  You should only ever use this other form Y.\"  What that tells us, in an indirect way, is that some people had <em>started</em> using X.  (After all, why would you complain about a \"mistake\" unless some people around you were actually making it?)  In other words: for at least some speakers of the language, we can conclude that X had become grammatical.</p>\n\n<p>So in these cases, we can learn about how people actually talked, and not just how they believed they should talk.  But this sort of thing is pretty rare.  Usually, yeah, it's just corpus work on the written language, like Cerberus describes.</p>\n", "Id":"861", "ParentId":"853", "CreationDate":"2011-10-20T19:56:10.393", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"306", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-20T19:56:10.393", "CommentCount":"2"}
