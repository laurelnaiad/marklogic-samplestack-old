{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Wikipedia, quoting Temes, Elmar, 1986, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_mutation#Celtic_languages\">writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Historically, the Celtic initial mutations originated from progressive assimilation and sandhi phenomena between adjacent words. For example, the mutating effect of the conjunction a 'and' is due to the fact that it used to have the form *ak, and the final consonant influenced the following sounds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are sandhi and sandhi-like phenomena in other IE languages (French for example), and this specific consonant mutation in celtic languages (which is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition\">lenition</a>) can be found in other IE languages. However, there are multiple types of lenition:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>diachronic - a lenition that has happened historically - a consonant was strong in Latin, but has weakened in Italian, for example</li>\n<li>synchronic - the change happens in the present form of a single language. Such, according to Wikipedia, happens in Western Romance languages in addition to Celtic languages, although it does not bear grammatical meaning as in Celtic ones.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"78", "ParentId":"9", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T06:13:50.983", "Score":"7", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"80", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T06:13:50.983", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"http://techblog.bozho.net", "Id":"80", "AccountId":"70258", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:45:02.257", "AboutMe":"<p>Bozhidar Bozhanov - Senior Java developer (<a href=\"http://bozho.net/cv/Bozhidar_Bozhanov_CV.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CV</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Creator of <a href=\"http://welshare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://welshare.com</a></p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Sofia, Bulgaria", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"753", "DisplayName":"Bozho", "LastAccessDate":"2012-08-08T11:21:15.973"}}
