{"Body":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_French\">Wikipedia mentions</a> the superstrate/substrate influence of Germanic languages as a possible reason. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The syntax shows the systematic presence of a subject pronoun in front\n  of the verb, as in the Germanic languages: je vois, tu vois, il voit,\n  while the subject pronoun is optional – function of the parameter\n  pro-drop – in the other Romance languages (as in veo, ves, ve).</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>French is noticeably different from most other Romance languages. Some\n  of the changes have been attributed to substrate influence—i.e. to\n  carry-over effects from Gaulish (Celtic) or superstrate—influence from\n  Frankish (Germanic).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same article also mentions that the subject became mandatory around 1500 (this is unsourced, though)</p>\n\n<p>Another possible reason maybe has something to do that due to sound changes, <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/459/french-conjugation-spoken-vs-written\">in spoken form the verb conjugation is not so obvious</a>. Normally only the <em>nous</em> and <em>vous</em> forms sound different. If you can't tell the conjugated verbs apart, I guess the subject becomes necessary.</p>\n\n<p>See also the paper: <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/4047573\">From Old French to the Theory of Pro-Drop</a> (thanks Alex B. for the link!)</p>\n", "Id":"1409", "ParentId":"1408", "LastEditorUserId":"92", "CreationDate":"2012-02-13T12:47:27.153", "OwnerUserId":"92", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-02-14T03:36:10.113", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-02-14T03:36:10.113", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"4", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"488", "WebsiteUrl":"http://claimid.com/louisr", "Id":"92", "AccountId":"163323", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:07:23.613", "AboutMe":"<p>trying to learn and help others learn :)</p>\n", "Age":"34", "Location":"Your computer", "DownVotes":"39", "Views":"97", "Reputation":"3271", "DisplayName":"Louis Rhys", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T16:45:57.423"}}
