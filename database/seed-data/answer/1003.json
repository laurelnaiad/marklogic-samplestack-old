{"Body":"<p>I don't know of a standard method, but it shouldn't be too difficult to make some metric of the variation in an orthographic form.</p>\n\n<p>We'll use the Wright-Fisher model, which is used to model genetic drift in biology.\nLet's say that a word has orthographic variants <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, and their prevalences at time <em>t</em> = 0 are <em>px</em>(0) and <em>py</em>(0) = 1 &ndash; <em>px</em>&#40;<em>t</em>). Imagine that all of the tokens of our word belong in generation 0. Now we start to do a procedure like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select <em>N</em> words at random from generation 0, using the prevalences at <em>t</em> = 0</li>\n<li>Now the words that we have selected form generation 1, which has its own prevalences, <em>px</em>(1) and 1 &ndash; <em>px</em>(1).</li>\n<li>Select <em>N</em> words from generation 1 to create generation 2, and so on, until we get to generation n where either <em>px</em>&#40;<em>n</em>) = 0 or <em>px</em>&#40;<em>n</em>) = 1. At this point we can say that one variant of the word has fixed, and there is no more drift.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A way of measuring how much longer the system is going to drift is by calculating the mean fixation time, or the average number of generations from generation 0 that it takes for one variant to fix. For large <em>N</em>, this number is:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hMiQ7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Since we set <em>N</em> arbitrarily, the important term is the one with the logarithms in it, which is equivalent to the entropy of the system, though the choice of base is e rather than 2. So if I were starting from scratch, I'd take the entropy as a way of quantifying the present variability, and the amount of time remaining before the system stabilizes, as a baseline measure. </p>\n\n<p>Just a thought.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://books.google.com.br/books?id=dsCZxYP15YEC\" rel=\"nofollow\">Principles of Evolution</a> eds.
