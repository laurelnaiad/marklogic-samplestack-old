Natural languages don't cease to be natural when their last native speaker dies. A native speaker is one that learnt it as a child. This means that it had at one time been learned as the first language of <strong>children</strong> (one child is not enough). So if adults got together to learn a language, it couldn't be a natural language until their children could use it as their sole and first language. A language that is no longer learnt by children will go extinct.</p>\n\n<p>The test of a definition of <em>natural language</em> is what to do with Esperanto. It now has at least three generations of native speakers (though they are all multilingual). Can a constructed language become a natural language by being the first language of children or will a constructed language always be a mere constructed language no matter what. It should be noted that the Esperanto these people speak is different and more complex than the Esperanto of the parents, who learnt it as adults.</p>\n", "Id":"288", "ParentId":"285", "CreationDate":"2011-09-19T13:47:57.627", "Score":"12", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"119", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-19T13:47:57.627", "CommentCount":"17"}
