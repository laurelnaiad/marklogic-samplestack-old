Imagine you're looking at early Latin dialects diverging from one another, and they've all got both <em>ambulare</em> and <em>mergere</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If people in town A tend to use <em>ambulare</em> more, people in town B next-door might be influenced to do the same.  But town Q isn't on the other side of the continent, and so there's no influence to end up with <em>ambulare</em> over <em>mergere</em>, so they've got 50/50 odds (assuming those are the only two words).</p>\n\n<p>This theory requires two phenomena: 1) that a language variant's lexicon can drift over time and 2) that one language variant can influence a similar one nearby.
