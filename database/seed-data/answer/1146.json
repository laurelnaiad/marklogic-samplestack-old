{"Body":"<p>If a language has a sequence of two <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vocoid\" rel=\"nofollow\">vocoids</a>, and one of them is high, there will be nothing in the signal to tell you whether you are dealing with a vowel+glide sequence or a vowel+vowel sequence. Three common sources of supplementary information (in decreasing order of empirical weight) are:</p>\n\n<p>1) Cases where there is a lexical contrast between the vowel+vowel and the vowel+glide sequence. In Vietnamese, for example, there are lexical contrasts where the relevant difference is /-ai/ vs. /-aj/, or /-ou/ vs. /-ow/. </p>\n\n<p>2) Morpho-phonological alternations or selectional restrictions that are sensitive to a vowel-consonant distinction. Two examples are given in Dixon (2010:196--9).</p>\n\n<p>3) Phonotactic considerations. Is a statement of the overall phonotactic patterns of the language simplified by choosing one analysis over the other?</p>\n\n<p>There will also be cases where no evidence is available. In these cases it will have to be admitted that there are no language-internal grounds for classifying the pattern in question.</p>\n\n<p>Dixion, R.M.W. (2010) Basic Linguistic Thoery, vol.1.
