{"Body":"<p><i>Erhua</i> [<a href=\"http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-YYYY200503021.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>] is a very pervasive example of derivational morphology in Mandarin, most often associated with northern dialects. It's commonly described as a diminutive suffix. Although stereotypically thought of as a feature of northern Mandarin, variants also exist in non-rhotic forms in other varieties [<a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/q217177163l24358/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>].</p>\n\n<p>E.g.</p>\n\n<p>dōngxī [tʊ̃ŋ˦.ɕi˦] 'east (and) west'</p>\n\n<p>dōngxi [tʊ̃ŋ˦.ɕiˑ] ~ dōngxīr [tʊ̃ŋ˦.ɕiɻ˦] 'thing'</p>\n\n<p>The previous example hints at possibly both derivational and inflectional morphology in Chinese, through the neutral tone. The majority of morpho-syllables in Chinese have citation tones, with few that are underlyingly toneless. However, some seem to surface without tone in certain situations. Some Mandarin examples are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>(Cf.

In any case, they are grammaticalized.</p>\n\n<p>Old Chinese might also have been less isolating than commonly thought. I think the consensus today is that Old Chinese derivational morphology, e.g. bound prefixes and suffixes, accounts for tonal correspondence in some word pairs in Chinese today [<a href=\"http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/09/69/04/PDF/TOKYO_tone_published.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] that are comparable to vestiges of PIE ablaut in English, like sing/sang/sung/song. So it might be that Sinitic languages have not moved much on the isolating-synthetic continuum.</p>\n\n<p>It's also important to keep in mind the nature of Chinese writing, which leads many to assume every character is a morpheme/syllable. Abbreviated characters fused from multiple characters have been attested since Old Chinese, and they may not have always represented monosyllabic morphemes. To illustrate with an analogy, in phonemic scripts, even though the ampersand is one symbol, and it can be read as a single phoneme in most Romance languages today, it would be wrong to conclude that the symbol always represented one sound.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, however, the evidence we have suggests Old Chinese was highly isolating, Middle Chinese was highly isolating, and modern Sinitic languages are still very isolating, but less so.</p>\n", "Id":"2564", "ParentId":"385", "LastEditorUserId":"1185", "CreationDate":"2012-09-16T08:05:28.913", "OwnerUserId":"1185", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-16T19:36:53.990", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"42", "Location":"KiTTYLand", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1185", "AccountId":"559628", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"456", "CreationDate":"2012-07-13T00:21:32.883", "DisplayName":"ROBOKiTTY", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T16:26:27.617", "AboutMe":"<p>Primarily work in LOLCODE, Java, C#, and C++.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-16T19:36:53.990", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"42", "Location":"KiTTYLand", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1185", "AccountId":"559628", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"456", "CreationDate":"2012-07-13T00:21:32.883", "DisplayName":"ROBOKiTTY", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T16:26:27.617", "AboutMe":"<p>Primarily work in LOLCODE, Java, C#, and C++.</p>\n"}}
