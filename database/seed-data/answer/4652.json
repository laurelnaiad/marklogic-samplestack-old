Some of these English nouns are borrowings directly from Latin, but this suffix has become productive in English too. (Some nouns on your list are from the same origin but borrowed through French, with a change in spelling and pronunciation, e.g. benison.)</p>\n\n<p>The class of words in -ism (and less frequently in -asm and -thm) comes from Greek, where -smos was a productive abstract noun formant. In this case too, -ism has become productive in English, so many words with this suffix don't have a Greek source (e.g. capitalism).</p>\n\n<p>Other than these two classes, I don't think there's really a pattern here; many of the other nouns you list are very rare, and I'm sure one could come up with a few verbs with similar endings to balance them.</p>\n", "Id":"4652", "ParentId":"4649", "CreationDate":"2013-10-08T04:56:39.687", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2411", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-08T04:56:39.687", "CommentCount":"1"}
