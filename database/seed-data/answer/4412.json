I discovered Computational Linguistics while receiving my B.A.Sc in Software Engineering when I built a basic bigram parser for an AI assignment. This caused me to become interested in linguistics and to take a few introductory level courses. I currently have completed my first year of my masters and am currently looking for a thesis topic.</p>\n"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>The big name in computer-based dictionaries is <a href=\"http://wordnet.princeton.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordNet</a> which groups English lexical items by concept (called <em>synsets</em>). I can be downloaded and used offline. Obviously, this tool is quite powerful and is used extensively a lot in various Computational Linguistic and Natural Language Processing applications. There are even projects to create WordNet equivalents for other languages.</p>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, some people have tried to map synsets across different languages. While I'm not an expert, a quick Google search revealed <a href=\"http://www.casta-net.jp/~kuribayashi/multi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiple projects</a> for <a href=\"http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet/\" rel=\"nofollow\">linking WordNet</a> to <a href=\"http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/908_Paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">various other ontological hierarchies</a>. Perhaps these would fit your needs.</p>\n", "Id":"4412", "ParentId":"4403", "CreationDate":"2013-09-10T09:47:50.283", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1055", "LastActivityDate":"2013-09-10T09:47:50.283", "CommentCount":"6"}
