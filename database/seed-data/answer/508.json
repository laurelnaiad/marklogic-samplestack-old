You can have a big vocabulary; you can learn that from books easily.  You pronounce each and every single word correctly (in isolation).  Also easily to be learned from books (every dictionary has the proper pronounciation listed... at least for the difficult or unusual words).</p>\n\n<p>And still, if your intonation is wrong, it's a dead giveaway.  And most native speakers would probably not be able to say what made you sound foreign, since <em>all you pronounce all the words correctly</em>.

Only from listening (a lot), and then practicing what you heard.</p>\n", "Id":"508", "ParentId":"486", "CreationDate":"2011-09-24T22:44:54.607", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"286", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-24T22:44:54.607", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://jaerhard.com", "Id":"286", "AccountId":"85539", "CreationDate":"2011-09-24T22:26:45.540", "AboutMe":"<p>Just some guy having too many accounts on too many sites (and most of those I can't even remember ;-)</p>\n", "Age":"49", "Location":"Karlsruhe, Germany", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"8", "Reputation":"130", "DisplayName":"JÃ¼rgen A.
