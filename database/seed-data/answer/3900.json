{"Body":"<p>First of all, this goal is seen as somewhat utopic today. </p>\n\n<p>If it was ok about 100-130 years ago for Johann Martin Schleyer (the inventor of Volap√ºk, the first constructed language that become relatively widespread), and possibly for Zamenhof (inventor of Esperanto) too*  nowadays the goal of introduction a neutral, constructed language for international communication seems to be absolutely unrealistic. Every language is backed by the economy of the state it comes from and there is no any neutral organisation (like UNO, for example) which would have a distantly similar influence to economy of English, Chinese or Spanish speaking countries.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>- even though there are some allegations that Esperanto was just a part of his philosophy, hillelism (later changed to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homaranismo\" rel=\"nofollow\">homaranism</a>), and potentially aimed only at Jews.</em></p>\n\n<p>By the way, the original goal \"to become a second language for all people in the world\", that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_movement\" rel=\"nofollow\">Esperanto movement</a> (not the language!) claimed during its early development (so-called \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finvenkismo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fina venko</a>\", the <em>final victory</em>) has been superseded by another concept, described in the \"Manifest of Raumo\" and therefore called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raumism\" rel=\"nofollow\">raumism</a>. It \"emphasizes instead the fact that the Esperanto-speaking community has itself become a culture, worthy of preservation and promotion for its own sake.\" (Wikipedia). </p>\n\n<p>Second, the language were not \"created\" by individuals, in Esperanto they prefer to use the word \"proposed\", or \"initially proposed\". The original project of Esperanto language, as proposed by Zamenhof, was (slightly) reformed during the first years to adapt it to real usage (most dramatic change was the changes to correlatives). This is true for other language projects as well, they often evolved dramatically over time and the language was re-tailored once some practical gaps became evident.</p>\n\n<p>And, thirdly, there are also languages which were from the very beginning created by many (at least >2) people, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua\" rel=\"nofollow\">Interlingua</a> -- created by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Auxiliary_Language_Association\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Auxiliary Language\nAssociation</a>. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido_%28language%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ido</a> -- was developed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_for_the_Adoption_of_an_International_Auxiliary_Language\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delegation for the\nAdoption of an International Auxiliary Language</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both languages were created not only by group of people, they were created by professional linguists (in contrast to oculist Zamenhof, pastor Schleyer, naval officier de Wahl (occidental/interlingue) etc.). But this didn't help much for them to become popular and widely used.</p>\n", "Id":"3900", "ParentId":"3898", "LastEditorUserId":"538", "CreationDate":"2013-06-23T20:42:44.710", "OwnerUserId":"538", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-23T21:21:31.997", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://blogs.wiki-dot.net/alaudo", "Id":"538", "AccountId":"158216", "CreationDate":"2011-11-28T09:09:29.497", "AboutMe":"<p>From December, 2013 I work as Software Developer at Microsoft Bing in Sunnyvale, California.</p>\n\n<p>Until October 2013 I worked as a Senior Developer at <a href=\"http://www.eurofins.de/de-de.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eurofins</a> in Hamburg, Germany.   </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft Azure Insider</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/academic/dd183640\" rel=\"nofollow\">Expert Student Partner</a> in German MSP Team.<br>\n7x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mta.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MTA</a> | 17x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcts.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCTS</a> | 5x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcitp.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCITP</a> | 5x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcpd.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCPD</a> | Azure MCSA | <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mct.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCT</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mcp.microsoft.com/authenticate/validatemcp.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft MCP Transcript</a> (ID: 827426, password: microsoft)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/alexandergalkin\">Careers 2.0</a> at SO   </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.wiki-dot.net/alaudo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blog \"Managed meets functional\"</a>   </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/alaudo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>   </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alaudo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li>Google+ profile</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Email: alaudo@gmail.com</p>\n\n<p>@alaudo</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Sunnyvale, CA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"396", "DisplayName":"Alexander Galkin", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T06:17:27.417"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-23T21:21:31.997", "Score":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://blogs.wiki-dot.net/alaudo", "Id":"538", "AccountId":"158216", "CreationDate":"2011-11-28T09:09:29.497", "AboutMe":"<p>From December, 2013 I work as Software Developer at Microsoft Bing in Sunnyvale, California.</p>\n\n<p>Until October 2013 I worked as a Senior Developer at <a href=\"http://www.eurofins.de/de-de.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eurofins</a> in Hamburg, Germany.   </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft Azure Insider</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/academic/dd183640\" rel=\"nofollow\">Expert Student Partner</a> in German MSP Team.<br>\n7x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mta.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MTA</a> | 17x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcts.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCTS</a> | 5x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcitp.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCITP</a> | 5x <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcpd.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCPD</a> | Azure MCSA | <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mct.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MCT</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mcp.microsoft.com/authenticate/validatemcp.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft MCP Transcript</a> (ID: 827426, password: microsoft)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/alexandergalkin\">Careers 2.0</a> at SO   </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.wiki-dot.net/alaudo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blog \"Managed meets functional\"</a>   </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/alaudo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>   </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alaudo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li>Google+ profile</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Email: alaudo@gmail.com</p>\n\n<p>@alaudo</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Sunnyvale, CA", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"396", "DisplayName":"Alexander Galkin", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T06:17:27.417"}}
