Other \"velar\" sounds include /g/, which when \"reduced\", makes half of the /w/. The other half, being that of the rounding of the lips, is a by-product of the back vowels, many of which are rounded (e.g., /u/ , /o/ ), which is why the /g/ in Cerberus's Dutch lexical examples only are realized as /w/ in English in those particular instances. </p>\n", "Id":"2549", "ParentId":"2524", "CreationDate":"2012-09-10T22:57:12.677", "Score":"-1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1323", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-10T22:57:12.677", "CommentCount":"4"}
