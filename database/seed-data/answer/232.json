{"Body":"<p>This is a palatalized /d/ or a /d/ with a palatal release, written /d ≤/. The superscript {j} is called MODIFIER LETTER SMALL J in Unicode. The name explains the difference in pronunciation. As you release the /d/ you simultaneously bunch up the tongue (behind the tip and maybe one thirds of the length backwards) towards the palate, without touching it. If you instead move the tongue backwards and bunch it all the way up to touch the palate and make a voiced stop there, you get a palatal stop, as is common in Indian English and some Norwegian dialects. If you instead of bunching the tongue up lower and flatten it you'll end up with the \"dzh\"-sound of \"juice\".</p>\n", "Id":"232", "ParentId":"206", "LastEditorUserId":"119", "CreationDate":"2011-09-16T18:28:49.710", "OwnerUserId":"119", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-16T19:29:23.683", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-16T19:29:23.683", "Score":"9", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"302", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"119", "AccountId":"14652", "Views":"52", "Reputation":"3065", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T14:24:24.227", "DisplayName":"kaleissin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:21:33.313", "AboutMe":"<p>Sysadmin/programmer by day, linguist by night.</p>\n"}}
