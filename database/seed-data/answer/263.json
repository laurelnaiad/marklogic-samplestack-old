He said few understand it for its potential to empirically and computationally verify different language models paper and pencil linguists, like himself, were creating. So UG for example, if it was a valid way to describe syntax, should be able to used in a computer application to emulate human processing of language, and should be good enough to show that model does work. A lot of the community, in my view when I studied CL in a school where paper and pencil ruled the land, saw it as way out there, unto itself.  He believed really solid language models had to be re-constructed and tested, and that CL was where rubber hit the road, not the place where people were using heuristics to cheat at language cognition, as a lot of it has become in terms of economic viability.</p>\n", "Id":"263", "ParentId":"150", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T03:52:29.807", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"156", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-18T03:52:29.807", "CommentCount":"1"}
