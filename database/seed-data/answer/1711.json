{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The words <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> are demonstrative pronouns. The sentences \"I would be more tired\" and \"I actually ended up being\" have the same syntactic function as \"this\" and \"that\" would have. But, being full clauses (instead of simple pronouns), they are classified as subordinate or dependent clauses. In your examples, they function as direct objects of the verb \"think\".</p>\n\n<p>Note that in your second example, the word \"that\" is also being used to introduce one of the subordinate clauses. But, in that case, it is a subordinating conjunction.</p>\n", "Id":"1711", "ParentId":"1709", "CreationDate":"2012-03-27T21:01:10.033", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-27T21:01:10.033", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
