{"Body":"<p>If you are interested, then <a href=\"http://www.cl.uzh.ch/research/nlp4quechua_en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here's a website with a list of resources for Quechua</a>, the most widely spoken indigenous language in the Americas. I highly recommend that you visit the following website:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cl.uzh.ch/research/nlp4quechua_en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cl.uzh.ch/research/nlp4quechua_en.html</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a project that is dedicated to collecting corpora for indigenous languages in South America. They are focusing especially on Quechua, Aymara and Guarani. The project is called <em>hltdi-l3</em> and is collecting parallel corpora for these languages and English.</p>\n\n<p>I am from Peru and I work in the computer linguistics area. In my experience I have found that the institution in my country that has the most corpora is the \"PUCP\". They have a project called <a href=\"http://www.lengamer.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>lengamer</em></a> which is focused on lots of indigenous languages (the website is in spanish):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lengamer.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lengamer.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>In my case I work with Quechua and Ashaninka. If I could be of any help just write to me.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the spelling and grammar mistakes in advance.</p>\n", "Id":"3496", "ParentId":"3488", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2013-04-06T15:19:09.433", "OwnerUserId":"1935", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-07T09:05:20.357", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-07T09:05:20.357", "Score":"2", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "WebsiteUrl":"http://unsaac.academia.edu/RichardAlexanderCastroMamani", "Location":"Cuzco, Peru", "Id":"1935", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1282292", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"33", "CreationDate":"2013-04-06T14:57:57.727", "DisplayName":"richardtk_1", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-26T14:16:47.353", "AboutMe":"<p>My interests are the Computer Science, Language Learning, Natural Language Processing.
