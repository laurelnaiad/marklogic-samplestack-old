{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I'm no linguist, but I learned a bit of Hungarian a few years ago, and discovered that word order is pretty free, and that it can be used to convey emphasis. English lacks word-order freedom, so emphasis is conveyed by inflection in the spoken language and typographical conventions (e.g italics) in the written language. My Hungarian friends tell me this is largely unnecessary in Hungarian because of the extra semantic dimension provided by the word-ordering.</p>\n", "Id":"2051", "ParentId":"1476", "CreationDate":"2012-06-05T15:10:09.577", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1074", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-05T15:10:09.577", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://makestuff.eu", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1074", "AccountId":"1543635", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2012-06-05T15:10:09.577", "DisplayName":"Chris McClelland", "LastAccessDate":"2012-06-05T15:10:09.577"}}
