The jargon of computer professionals was not constructed for the purpose of hiding the meaning of what they are saying from outsiders - it may have that effect, but that was not the purpose. The purpose is to have short hand words that have specific defined meanings that allow for more efficient communication. For example the word \"file\" can replace the phrase \"a block of information stored as a unit on an information storage device\". So jargon is a matter of efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>From your definitions \"argot\" has the purpose of secrecy that would prevent eavesdroppers from understanding the meaning of the conversation.</p>\n", "Id":"2833", "ParentId":"2812", "CreationDate":"2012-11-12T20:47:55.633", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1139", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-12T20:47:55.633", "CommentCount":"3"}
