{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There are a few examples of substrate influence in the varieties of English in the UK.  For a phonological influence, you can look at how old-fashioned speech in some communities of Wales, where Welsh is still widely spoken. The speech here, especially of older people, can maintain features like rhoticity (not found in most of Wales, but present in Welsh) and also  being devoiced, so that older speakers may have <em>cars</em> pronounced with [s] rather than the standard [z], probably due to the absence of such a distinction in Welsh.  As for grammatical functions, you could look at Shetland Scots, where Norn, an extinct Norse language has a substrate influence.  For example, Shetland Scots maintains a T-V distinction, with two different forms for the formal and informal form of the second person personal pronoun.</p>\n", "Id":"1566", "ParentId":"190", "CreationDate":"2012-03-04T16:05:28.957", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"783", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-04T16:05:28.957", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://None", "Id":"783", "AccountId":"1263184", "CreationDate":"2012-02-20T12:40:45.587", "AboutMe":"<p>English Language graduate.</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"Wales", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"1036", "DisplayName":"Danger Fourpence", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T19:41:06.517"}}
