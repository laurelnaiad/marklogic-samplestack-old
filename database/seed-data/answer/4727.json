{"Body":"<p>This is an interesting case - there's an awful lot on the semantics of exceptive markers (such as the paper you linked to), but i'm not sure i'm familiar with anything on their syntax.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to note as a preliminary is that [but John], which i'll tentatively call the <em>exceptive phrase</em>, can appear discontinuous from the NP <em>no one</em> which it seems to modify, although it's fairly restricted in where it can appear.</p>\n\n<p>(1) <strong>[No one] [but John]</strong> attended the meeting<br>\n(2) <strong>[No one]</strong> attended the meeting <strong>[but John]</strong><br>\n(3) * <strong>[No one]</strong> attended <strong>[but John]</strong> the meeting<br>\n(4) * <strong>[but John] [no one]</strong> attended the meeting</p>\n\n<p>Note that the exceptive phrase can't appear between the verb and it's object. It can appear here, however, if we just make the object a little heavier, licensing heavy NP shift:</p>\n\n<p>(5) ? <strong>[No one]</strong> attended <strong>[but John]</strong> [the meeting we all said we would go to]</p>\n\n<p>We can tell that [no one] is sitting fairly high when it appears discontinuous from the subject because we can have intervening adverbials:</p>\n\n<p>(6) <strong>[No one]</strong> attended the meeting yesterday <strong>[but John]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also, having a reflexive in object position doesn't give rise to a principle C violation with a co-referring proper name in the exceptive phrase, so we know that the exceptive phrase isn't c-commanded by the object:</p>\n\n<p>(7) <strong>[No one]</strong> shaved himself <strong>[but John]</strong></p>\n\n<p>The fact that a reflexive (probably a logophor in this case) can be bound in the exceptive phrase by the subject shows that the exceptive phrase is c-commanded by the subject even when the two are discontinuous:</p>\n\n<p>(8) <strong>[Nobody's mother]</strong> likes anybody <strong>[but herself]</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's worth comparing the distribution of [but X] with [except X], since both seem to have a very similar function:</p>\n\n<p>(9) <strong>[No one] [except John]</strong> attended the meeting.<br>\n(10) <strong>[No one]</strong> attended the meeting <strong>[except John]</strong><br>\n(11) * <strong>[No one]</strong> attended <strong>[except John]</strong> the meeting<br>\n(12) ??? <strong>[except John] [no one]</strong> attended the meeting<br>\n<em>((12) only grammatical with prosodic break between exceptive phrase and subject)</em></p>\n\n<p>So it looks like, more or less, [except X] and [but X] have an identical distribution. One interesting thing to note is that sentence-initial exceptive phrases can be repaired by inserting <em>for</em>:</p>\n\n<p>(13) <strong>[but for John] [No one]</strong> attended the meeting.<br>\n(14) <strong>[Except for John] [no one]</strong> attended the meeting.</p>\n\n<p>These variations sound a little odd if not sentence initial:</p>\n\n<p>(15) ?? <strong>[no one] [except for John]</strong> attended the meeting.<br>\n(16) ??? <strong>[no one] [but for John]</strong> attended the meeting<br>\n(17) ?? <strong>[no one]</strong> attended the meeting <strong>[except for John]</strong><br>\n(18) ??? <strong>[no one]</strong> attended the meeting <strong>[but for John]</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don't have an analysis (and hence, no answer) yet, but i thought it would be interesting to leave these facts here as a work in progress. Tentatively, it looks like the exceptive phrase can be stranded in the VP-internal subject position by A-movement of the subject to the matrix subject position, hence the possibility of the discontinuous order. I'll be coming back to this when i have some more time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Some more observations:</p>\n\n<p><em>but</em>-exceptives are restricted in the sorts of phrases they can modify:</p>\n\n<p>(i) <strong>[Everyone]</strong> [but Sally] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(ii) <strong>[No one]</strong> [but Sally] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(iii) <strong>[All boys]</strong> [but John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(iv) ?? <strong>[Each boy]</strong> [but John] jumped into the swimming pool. - <em>Not sure about this one</em><br>\n(iv) # <strong>[Most boys]</strong> [but John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(v) # <strong>[Some boys]</strong> [but John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(vi) # <strong>[The team]</strong> [but John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(vii) # <strong>[A group of boys]</strong> [but John] jumped into the swimming pool  </p>\n\n<p>From the data above, it looks like <em>but</em>-exceptives can only modify something quantificational, but it only plays nicely with certain quantifiers (presumably this is a fact that can be derived from the semantics of the exceptive phrase). Additionally, it doesn't seem to play nicely with an overt distributive marker <em>each</em>, which i find odd. <em>except</em>-exceptives stand in stark contrast:</p>\n\n<p>(i) <strong>[Everyone]</strong> [except Sally] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(ii) <strong>[No one]</strong> [except Sally] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(iii) <strong>[All boys]</strong> [except John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(iv)  ?? <strong>[Each boy]</strong> [except John] jumped into the swimming pool.<br>\n(iv) ? <strong>[Most boys]</strong> [except John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(v) ?? <strong>[Some boys]</strong> [except John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(vi) ? <strong>[The team]</strong> [except John] jumped into the swimming pool<br>\n(vii) ? <strong>[A group of boys]</strong> [except John] jumped into the swimming pool  </p>\n\n<p><em>except</em>-exceptives seem much more free to modify non-quantificational DPs. Curiouser and curiouser.</p>\n", "Id":"4727", "ParentId":"4720", "LastEditorUserId":"2328", "CreationDate":"2013-10-13T15:40:55.763", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-14T11:37:36.703", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"123", "WebsiteUrl":"https://sites.google.com/site/patrickdelliott/", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HGYBE.jpg", "Id":"2328", "AccountId":"3146009", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:16:59.797", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at University College London.
