{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It looks like you'll have to learn enough English syntax to do what you need. What you'll certainly need is lists of transformations (\"rules, processes, constructions, alternations,\" etc), how they are constrained, and what their boundary conditions are. Then you'll have to figure out (or build software to figure out) which ones have operated in the complex sentences (hint: suspect infinitives) and then unwind them. Some information will be useful and some won't.  </p>\n\n<p>Here's a few to start, in increasing order of length and breadth of coverage:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/Haj-list-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">list</a>, revised 2010 by Haj Ross, of <code>the Â¡TOP ONE HUNDRED PLUS TRANSFORMATIONS OF 1999! for your inspection of and additions to.</code> This is very short; just a list to keep track of which example has which name. </p></li>\n<li><p>A book, by Beth Levin (1993 <em>English Verb Classes and Alternations</em>), on governed cyclic rules, with both a <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/levin.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">verb index</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/levin.verbs2.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">verb class index</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another book, by Jim McCawley (1998 <em>The Syntactic Phenomena of English,</em> 2d ed) is a college-level textbook that's very clear and uses a consistent system throughout to explain the terms and issues. It's not simple; this is about the level of DiffEQ. But it's better than the other alternatives.</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"1620", "ParentId":"1619", "CreationDate":"2012-03-12T15:43:11.130", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"482", "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-12T15:43:11.130", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
