The strategy I used was to break up words into morphemes, and use one character per morpheme (and a lot of morphemes of the same meaning were collapsed into single characters, e.g. -tion, -ment, etc.; morphemes were often also collapsed into normal words with similar meaning). As English has a lot of agglutinative tendencies (particularly in derivation), this was generally very straightforward. For the sake of efficiency, though, I chose not to represent nonessential morphemes, such as verb agreement conjugates. I also chose to not have any orthographic contrast between contractions and their full forms. In any case, this strategy requires a bunch of simple characters for derivative and inflectional morphemes, as there can be many of them per word; Chinese characters could be used, but would be cumbersome due to the number of strokes.</p>\n\n<p>To pull a few random words from this post and how they would be represented (I actually would often use words to represent morphemes, but you get the idea):<br/>\nReally: real -ly<br/>\nConducted: conduct -ed<br/>\nMorphemes: morph element -s<br/>\nAgglutinative: agglutinate -ive<br/>\nNonessential: non- essence -al<br/>\nTheir: they -'s<br/>\nInflectional: in- flex -tion -al</p>\n", "Id":"6379", "ParentId":"6375", "CreationDate":"2014-01-12T01:52:14.313", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1097", "LastActivityDate":"2014-01-12T01:52:14.313", "CommentCount":"3"}
