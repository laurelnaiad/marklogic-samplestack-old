{"Body":"<p>Fingerspelling is usually used for spelling out words that do not have a sign.\nFor example, given names may often be spelled out (unless that person has a known sign). </p>\n\n<p>The same goes for countries, cities, loan words, product names etc. when the signer either doesn't know the sign, or there is no sign.</p>\n\n<p>Whether spelling out words has any additional function, i.e. people choosing to spell out words that everyone in the conversation knows the sign for... I'm not so sure. :)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Apparently, fingerspelling can also be used to emphasise words. For instance, in Swedish SL one might spell the word #IDIOT rather than sign it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Basic knowledge of Swedish Sign Language</em></p>\n", "Id":"2945", "ParentId":"2942", "LastEditorUserId":"1452", "CreationDate":"2012-12-06T09:31:00.407", "OwnerUserId":"1452", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-09T12:18:09.960", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Groningen, Netherlands", "Id":"1452", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1943733", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"188", "CreationDate":"2012-10-30T17:13:14.697", "DisplayName":"Bjerva", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-17T14:05:45.320", "AboutMe":"<p>Ph.D. student in Computational Semantics at the University of Groningen</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-09T12:18:09.960", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Groningen, Netherlands", "Id":"1452", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"1943733", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"188", "CreationDate":"2012-10-30T17:13:14.697", "DisplayName":"Bjerva", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-17T14:05:45.320", "AboutMe":"<p>Ph.D. student in Computational Semantics at the University of Groningen</p>\n"}}
