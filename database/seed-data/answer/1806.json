{"Body":"<p>Usually it is argued that proper nouns have an extension (\"the class of things to which it is correctly applied\", Lyons 1977) but, unlike common nouns, they lack an intension (\"the set of essential properties which determines the applicability of the term\", Lyons 1977). In other words, the extension of Dublin is a singleton (or there might be more elements in that set, if there is more than one Dublin). However, Dublin has no intension at all - there is no property of \"Dublin-ness\" that all Dublins would share.</p>\n\n<p>Or another example. There are lots of people called John. However, there is no property that, by virtue of having it, qualifies you to be John. There is no \"John-ness\". You are named John ad hoc.</p>\n\n<p>An apple, on the other hand, can be described as \"the round firm fruit, typically having crisp white flesh and green, yellow, or red skin\" (from OED).
