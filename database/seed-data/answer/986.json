{"Body":"<p>There is a difference between semantics (literal or metaphorical meanings) of utterances and their pragmatics (the real world contextual implications).</p>\n\n<p>Sarcasm (though possibly marked phonetically in English by change in prosody) is a phenomenon of pragmatics.</p>\n\n<p>In English, two positives <strong>never</strong> make a negative, the ostensible semantic derivation is that it is emphasis by repetition or, with mathematical terminology, idempotent.</p>\n\n<p>The surface meaning of 'yeah, right' or 'yeah, yeah' is assuredly positive. It is the situation that let's us see that the student is only implicitly contradicting the teacher.</p>\n\n<p>As to other languages, I'm sure the same joke can be translated, but that doesn't make the utterance of two positives a negative there also. Your Bulgarian example may be a native ostensible definition for 'da, da', but it is not a well known phenomenon among the worlds languages (if truly at all) for it to be a true negative.</p>\n", "Id":"986", "ParentId":"981", "LastEditorUserId":"4", "CreationDate":"2011-11-08T17:44:44.903", "OwnerUserId":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-08T18:43:50.990", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"432", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"United States", "Id":"4", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"167219", "Views":"42", "Reputation":"1906", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:24:01.087", "DisplayName":"Mitch", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-15T11:56:51.610", "AboutMe":"<p>Native speaker of American English (AmE) with touches of Southern AmE.\nProficient in French and German.
