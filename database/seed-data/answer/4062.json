{"Body":"<p>I will suggest two fields that might be of interest, although I can't say for sure they will give you what you need.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ontologies</strong> organise lexical items hierarchically. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Wikipedia has an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontologies\" rel=\"nofollow\">article on (web) ontologies</a>, and there is also a <a href=\"http://techwiki.openstructs.org/index.php/Ontology_Tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of ontology tools</a>. If you find a ready-made ontology for English and a way of querying the number of nodes one has to traverse to travel from word 1 to word 2 this would provide a measure of semantic distance. I quickly skimmed the list of tools and haven't found anything ready-made that can achieve this. Perhaps another Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow?) would be a good place to ask for that.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Distributional semantics</strong></a> is based on the assumption that words that frequently occur in similar contexts are closely related in meaning. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given a large enough corpus, distributional-similarity data can be used to compute semantic relatedness. I suppose the ideal solution for you would be a table with all words as rows and columns, giving semantic distance scores for each pair of words. </p>\n\n<p>My brief search didn't turn up anything like that, but you may be able to build your own semantic distance matrix by acquiring a large corpus and using the tools and guides provided by the website for a <a href=\"https://clseslli09.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">course on distributional semantics</a> at the European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information 2009. Also, people working in the <a href=\"http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/composes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">COMPOSES project</a> might already be able to share something like a distance matrix with you or point out other sources.</p>\n", "Id":"4062", "ParentId":"4059", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2013-07-25T22:29:56.467", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-25T02:10:49.093", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-25T02:10:49.093", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
