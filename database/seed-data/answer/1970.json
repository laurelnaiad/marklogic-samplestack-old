{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>As for wh-phrase placement in general in American Sign Language anyway, the wh-phrase may occur in clause initial or final position if it corresponds with the subject, but it can only occur clause finally if it corresponds with the object. I'm fairly certain that a double wh-phrase can correspond with either a subject or object.\nIn American Sign Language when a second wh-phrase is used it is sometimes/often for emphasis, as in the difference between the english \"Who does John love?\" and \"John loves who??\". But this isn't the only time when it is used. I think it is mostly optional, but as with anything linguistically optional I think it carries nuances, although I don't know what they might be, sorry.\nIf you are looking for more detailed information I recommend chapter 7 in The Syntax of American Sign Language: Functional categories and hierarchical structure. by Carol Neidle; Judy Kegl; Dawn MacLaughlin; Benjamin Bahan; and Robert Lee (2000). It only covers American Sign Language but it might help.</p>\n", "Id":"1970", "ParentId":"1966", "CreationDate":"2012-05-21T02:03:51.000", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1022", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-21T02:03:51.000", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1022", "AccountId":"1497041", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"21", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T07:09:33.983", "DisplayName":"StoneRose", "LastAccessDate":"2012-05-31T08:05:51.350", "AboutMe":""}}
