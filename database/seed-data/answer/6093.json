Actually, the modern Khalkha Mongolian <code>жижиг</code> comes from the Old Mongolian <code>didig</code>, which also has the two first syllables identical, and the Turkish <code>küçük</code> comes from the Proto-Turkic <code>*kičük</code>. So, my answer is: no, they are not related.</p>\n", "Id":"6093", "ParentId":"6092", "CreationDate":"2013-12-09T12:09:41.400", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2689", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-09T12:09:41.400", "CommentCount":"1"}
