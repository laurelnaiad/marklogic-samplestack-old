If you instead would like to assume that the singular form in the paradigm is the most basic, then you are required to admit morphological operations such as <em>subtraction</em>, <em>truncation</em>, and <em>ellipsis</em>. If you read French and have access to a university library, consider looking in Mel'cuk's <em>Cours de morphologie générale</em> on the topic, or that failing, find a copy of his more condensed and more widely available English work, <em>Aspects of the Theory of Morphology</em>.</p>\n", "Id":"3607", "ParentId":"3587", "CreationDate":"2013-04-25T02:22:08.077", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-25T02:22:08.077", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"180", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.buffalo.edu/~lovegren", "Location":"Buffalo, NY", "Id":"483", "DownVotes":"5", "AccountId":"1021213", "Views":"70", "Reputation":"6503", "CreationDate":"2011-11-05T19:57:14.530", "DisplayName":"jlovegren", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:42:41.207", "AboutMe":""}}
