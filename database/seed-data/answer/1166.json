A system performing this task takes an english word and translates it to a phonetic transcription. If you search for this on Google you will find information how it is done and there are even some freely available systems for this task,  I didn't find one that works online though. If you want CVC instead of a phonetic transcription, it should be a simple replacement task from there.</p>\n\n<p>About your data problem: To get a list of frequent english words have a look at the 1-Grams at <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/datasets\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Ngrams</a> or get an english <a href=\"http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">wordlist</a> and  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7764229/sort-words-by-their-usage\">sort it by word frequency</a>. If you are interested in dictionary entries, you can look up the words in Wikipedia afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>All in all this is a task which can be done, but you probably won't solve it if you don't have a little experience in programming, as I doubt that there are online tools which do exactely what you want to do.</p>\n", "Id":"1166", "ParentId":"1161", "CreationDate":"2011-12-16T20:29:28.707", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"383", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-16T20:29:28.707", "CommentCount":"7"}
