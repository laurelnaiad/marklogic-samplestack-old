The paper also gives a very nice introduction to argumentation in historical linguistics.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that these terms are based on the earliest 'intelligible' babble of babies. The most common first syllable produced by babies is [ma], with [pa/ba/ta/da] following soon after. These earliest articulations are probably just play for the child, but are interpreted by parents as attempts by the baby to address them. As mothers tend to be the main early caregiver the earliest-occurring syllable, typically [ma], is interpreted as referring to them, while the next-occurring syllables are very commonly interpreted as referring to the father. This gives rise to the strong, but not invariant, association of [ma] with 'mother' and [pa/ba/ta/da] with 'father'.</p>\n", "Id":"869", "ParentId":"865", "CreationDate":"2011-10-22T04:50:10.380", "Score":"30", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"363", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-22T04:50:10.380", "CommentCount":"2"}
