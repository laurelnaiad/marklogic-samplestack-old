{"Body":"<p>The English word \"right\" comes from Proto-Indo-European word <strong><em>o̯reĝtos</em></strong> which meant \"correct\" and had cognates <strong><em>o̯reĝr</em></strong> \"directive, order\", <strong><em>o̯reĝs</em></strong> \"king, ruler\", <strong><em>o̯reĝti</em></strong> \"guides, directs\", <strong><em>o̯reĝi̯om</em></strong> \"kingdom\". The root itself meant \"direct, straight\" and reflected in many English words both inherited and borrowed, such as \"direction\", \"correction\", \"rectum\", \"region\".</p>\n\n<p>The Russian and Polish word \"pravo\" originates from a different PIE root and cognate with the English word \"first\" and German word \"Frau\". The basic meaning of the root \"per-\" was \"over\", \"through\" as in PIE adverb <strong><em>peri</em></strong>, but later the meaning also shifted to \"against\" as in <strong><em>proti</em></strong>, \"forward, ahead\" and further to \"first\" as in <strong><em>prou̯os</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>The later word, <strong><em>prou̯os</em></strong>, meaning \"first\" was used to designate a province headsman (\"first\" in the settlement), and later \"judge\" and \"lord\" (with feminine form <strong><em>preu̯ia̯</em></strong> meaning \"mistress, lady\", reflected in German \"Frau\") and gave rise to the Slavic legal term as well as the Russian terms meaning \"correct\", \"just\". </p>\n", "Id":"6138", "ParentId":"2555", "LastEditorUserId":"624", "CreationDate":"2013-12-14T09:48:39.213", "OwnerUserId":"624", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-12-14T09:59:35.850", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-14T09:59:35.850", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"81", "DownVotes":"60", "Id":"624", "AccountId":"407237", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"1743", "CreationDate":"2011-12-28T07:24:31.420", "DisplayName":"Anixx", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T10:33:34.597"}}
