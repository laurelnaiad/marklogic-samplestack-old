{"Body":"<p>I am sure that the book <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3t8ubnj\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Morphology: a study of the relation between meaning and form</em></a> by Joan L. Bybee (1985) has something about the relative order of inflectional affixes.</p>\n\n<p>I think it was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>valence > voice > aspect > tense > mood > person-and-number</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which leaves out \"polarity\" but includes both \"valence\" and \"person-and-\nnumber\".</p>\n\n<p>However as I recall Bybee uses two of the three terms \"modality, mode, mood\" \nwith non-synonymous meanings; I can't remember exactly which one meant \nwhat.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway that kind of says something about what the hierarchy I was looking \nfor actually is (descriptive adequacy); I don't know how to achieve \nexplanatory adequacy, though.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0808D&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;P=R10348&amp;D=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">This post to CONLANG</a> talks about which accidents are likelier shown by inflection, which are likelier shown by some other means, and which are likelier not shown.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512C&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;P=R5985&amp;D=1&amp;H=0&amp;O=T&amp;T=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">This post</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bybee also investigates, for each pair of markings, which one tends to\n  be closer to the stem in case they occur on the same side of the stem.\n  She also investigates which markings tend to be fused with the stem. \n  This involved investigating both which features tended to be marked by\n  stem-changes instead of affixes, and which affixes tended to get\n  changed depending upon which stem they were being applied to.  </p>\n  \n  <p>In every language derivational markers tend to be closer to the stem\n  than inflectional markers; and whichever marker is closest to the stem\n  is most likely to be fused with it.  Within those restrictions, the\n  hierarchy tended to be valence, voice, aspect, tense, mood,\n  person-and-number.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Person-and-number agreement were often combined in one morpheme. \n  Person-agreement is never derivational, it is only inflectional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"436", "ParentId":"365", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T22:59:21.137", "OwnerUserId":"236", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-05T15:10:44.390", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
