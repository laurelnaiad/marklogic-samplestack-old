{"Body":"<p>All of the above are good for assessing if someone has learned an L2 language in non-academic settings, such as when you are deciding whether to hire someone, or what grade to give them.</p>\n\n<p>In studies, a common way to measure acquisition is to give the subject a bunch of sample phrases and ask them to rate their grammaticality. High scores are taken to be correlated with higher linguistic competence; linguists compare the tested population's scores against the scores of a control group of L1 learners.</p>\n\n<p>There are other methods, but that one is pretty basic and pretty common. While this particular assessment tests syntactic competence, it can be pretty easily adapted to test competence in other domains; you can give them nonce-words (like blug and ftalze) and ask them to say if they would be acceptable words in the L2 language or not. </p>\n", "Id":"754", "ParentId":"423", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-10-09T04:53:25.503", "OwnerUserId":"350", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-09T06:57:23.377", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-09T06:57:23.377", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"15", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"350", "AccountId":"920001", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"872", "CreationDate":"2011-09-29T14:58:17.387", "DisplayName":"Nathan", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-11T17:54:15.000", "Age":"26"}}
