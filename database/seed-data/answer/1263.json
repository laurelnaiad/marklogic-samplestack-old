I work on Tlingit, a critically endangered language of northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and southeast Alaska. I also have extensive interests in the related Athabaskan languages, language documentation theory and practice, orthography design, morphological theory, phonological theory, and the syntax of noun phrases and relativization.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been using TeX and friends for more than a decade. I use Xe(La)TeX, fontspec, memoir, and BibLaTeX extensively, and I am working on a BibLaTeX style for linguistics publications. Other packages I use frequently include pst-jtree, expex, and booktabs. I’m learning PGF/TikZ and considering developing a library to produce autosegmental representation diagrams. I do my writing in TeXShop, and my TeX programming in MacVim, having abandoned FSF Emacs and XEmacs due to their perpetually disappointing Unicode rendering.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Vancouver, Canada", "DownVotes":"5", "Views":"13", "Reputation":"866", "DisplayName":"James C.", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-03T19:13:48.097"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>Lindeman, Fredrik Otto. 1987. <i>Introduction to the ‘laryngeal theory’</i>.

It’s not the most up-to-date given its 1970s provenance, but it’s probably the best place to start. As with any monograph, you should also read the published reviews of it for other people’s criticism. After that I think everything else you would want would be articles published in journals or collections.</p>\n", "Id":"1263", "ParentId":"1239", "CreationDate":"2012-01-12T20:53:34.260", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"511", "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-12T20:53:34.260", "CommentCount":"1"}
