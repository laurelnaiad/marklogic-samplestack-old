{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>In (neo-)Davidsonian semantics, what you call activities is called <strong>events</strong>. Teaching/cooking in your example would be <strong>complex events</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A typical example is \"Brutus stabbed Caesar. Caesar died.\" vs. \"Brutus killed Caesar\". Brutus' killing Caesar is a complex event that comprises stabbing and dying (the former causes the latter). It's not an atomic (causative) predicate since there's a time spam between the two events. Google for \"neo-Davidsonian semantics\" for papers and slides that discuss events in more detail.</p>\n", "Id":"4640", "ParentId":"4637", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T15:55:25.510", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2451", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-07T15:55:25.510", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"54", "Location":"Prague, Czech Republic", "DownVotes":"3", "Id":"2451", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "AccountId":"935824", "Views":"11", "Reputation":"782", "CreationDate":"2013-09-09T18:11:01.840", "DisplayName":"Atamiri", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T01:11:49.140", "Age":"36"}}
