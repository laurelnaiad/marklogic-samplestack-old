Canadian Raising, eh? In Sound Structure and Sense: Studies in Memory of Edmund Gussmann. Eugeniusz Cyran, Henryk Kardela, Bogdan Szymanek (eds.) Lublin:  Wydawnictwo KUL. Pp. 321-352</p>\n\n<p>Basically, Kaye formalizes Musicallinguists' answer above but for NYC English and proposes separate phoneme status. The reason you get the CR phenomenon in writer/rider and slighter/slider but not sighter/cider is because the backing of /aɪ/ to /ɑɪ/ (which is the difference in vowel quality) operates in closed syllables at the end of words except when before voiceless consonants. So 'ride'and 'slide' get the backed vowel. Then the addition of the suffix -er opens the syllable, but does not alter the vowel quality. Same is true for 'riding' and 'sliding.' 'Cider' on the other hand starts in an open syllable, so the backing never takes place. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, I was talking about this just the other day with Erik Thomas. </p>\n", "Id":"4107", "ParentId":"4103", "CreationDate":"2013-08-02T20:50:04.910", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1955", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-02T20:50:04.910", "CommentCount":"1"}
