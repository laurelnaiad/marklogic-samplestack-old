{"Body":"<p>You should read Peter T. Daniels' 1996 article \"<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/25203647\">Methods of decipherment</a>\" in an excellent book, <em>The world's writing systems</em>, eds. Daniels and Bright. New York: Oxford University Press. He has a really nice  table, \"Typology of decipherment\" (adapted from Gelb 1973, 1975):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5r5pN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Type O: (e.g., Punic texts written in Greek letters, Indian names in Chinese Buddhist compositions)</li>\n<li>Type IA: (e.g. Phoenician, Ugaritic)</li>\n<li>Type IB: familiar languages in unknown scripts (e.g., Linear B, Maya glyphs)</li>\n<li>Type II: codes and ciphers (cryptanalysis); pronounceable but unintelligible languages (e.g., Sumerian, Elamite, Hittite)</li>\n<li>Type III: (e.g., Mesopotamian cuneiform)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the above-mentioned article, you can also read about steps in decipherment (cataloging, distributional analysis etc.)</p>\n\n<p>The number of different characters is also important:</p>\n\n<p>about 30 => abjad (alphabet);</p>\n\n<p>about 100 => abugida (syllabry);</p>\n\n<p>about 300 => logosyllabry (logography)</p>\n\n<p>Re your last question, at first, most, if not all, languages are in contact with each other,  i.e. there are borrowings. Secondly, there are extra-linguistic cues, e.g. a place where your text was found (thus, you may expect words for certain concepts, like certain types of trees or animals). People who spoke that unknown language should have contacts with other civilizations, thus, you may find certain proper names or concepts mentioned in an already known language. </p>\n\n<p>In your example, there might be drawings of triangles and squares etc. All that might help make educated guesses and it could be a good start.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, there are some (still) undeciphered languages, because either there isn't enough material to (credibly) decipher them or nothing is known about their linguistic affinity.</p>\n", "Id":"1004", "ParentId":"1001", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2011-11-10T05:27:54.023", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-11T10:44:49.703", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
