When nice phonological demonstrations like vowel harmony aren't available, prosody is the next recourse. If prosody isn't helpful, you're pretty much left with an open question - you have to reason from the rest of the language's typology, and if that provides no further help, you're basically stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Many languages with a long history of being written don't follow the above criteria exactly, and often divide words from affixes based on either the etymology of the morphemes in question or on historical spelling patterns. Some languages, in either their native systems or in romanisations, largely ignore the criteria, though - Japanese particles seem very much like they ought to be considered affixes (certainly they're not separable prosodically, and they've undergone some word-medial sound changes to their initial consonants), but the prevailing non-scientific romanisations (and several scientific romanisations) treat them as separate words.</p>\n", "Id":"5887", "ParentId":"5886", "CreationDate":"2013-11-11T19:44:05.900", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2132", "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-11T19:44:05.900", "CommentCount":"3"}
