In French, these correspond to the infinitive endings <em>-re</em>, <em>-er</em>, and <em>-ir</em>.  These are like gender in that they don't correspond to any semantic property of the verb.  Unlike gender (as expressed in Romance), it's difficult to point to a single morpheme as the \"gender marker.\"  However, the different verb classes have differences that pervade the paradigm of tense and agreement marking.  In the Romance context, this is sometimes called the \"theme vowel,\" hearkening back to a stage of the language when the morphology was more segmentable.  </p>\n\n<p>Many other languages have a notion of \"verb class\" that is even less morphologically transparent.  Old English for example had seven classes of strong verbs; each of these had a different ablaut pattern.  (There were also three different weak verb classes.)</p>\n", "Id":"1925", "ParentId":"1922", "CreationDate":"2012-05-13T07:34:22.060", "Score":"11", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-13T07:34:22.060", "CommentCount":"2"}
