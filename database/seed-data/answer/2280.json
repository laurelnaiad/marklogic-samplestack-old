Also, new words are easy to understand if you are familiar with the root. Hebrew words fall into a finite number of buildings (בניינים) that let you pick out the roots very easily. You will loose that advantage if you transcribe. Also you might loose the difference between differing letters with similar sound, such as וו and ב, for instance the words שבה and שווה would be pronounced the same but have different meanings.</p>\n\n<p>For what reason do you want to use transcriptions? I may be able to help devise a plan based on your goal.</p>\n", "Id":"2280", "ParentId":"2278", "CreationDate":"2012-07-20T14:07:17.450", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"536", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-20T14:07:17.450", "CommentCount":"8"}
