{"Body":"<p>Bluntly, Slovak and Slovenian have nothing in common other than being both Slavic languages. No more than Slovak or Serbian or Slovak and Ukrainian. This is a question driven by superficial similarity in their names which <a href=\"http://www.slovak-republic.org/slovenia\">I'm sure members of both nations are thoroughly sick of</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it is true that Czechs and Slovaks will perceive Slovenian as less alien than Serbian from which we could possibly make some tentative conclusions. But that still doesn't make them mutually intelligible nor is there any meaningful basis for comparison other than the name.</p>\n", "Id":"3904", "ParentId":"3889", "LastEditorUserId":"1079", "CreationDate":"2013-06-24T07:12:35.600", "OwnerUserId":"2121", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-06-25T10:50:42.897", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"22", "WebsiteUrl":"http://blog.svick.org", "Location":"Prague, Czech Republic", "Id":"1079", "DownVotes":"0", "AccountId":"18071", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"103", "CreationDate":"2012-06-06T23:54:57.203", "DisplayName":"svick", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-12T15:30:34.950", "Age":"26"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-25T10:50:42.897", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"13", "WebsiteUrl":"http://metaphorhacker.net", "Location":"UK", "Id":"2121", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"2843698", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"453", "CreationDate":"2013-06-01T07:00:55.230", "DisplayName":"Dominik Lukes", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T22:31:39.843", "AboutMe":"<p>My primary research is in figurative language and discourse but I've also taught intro to general linguistics, basic phonology and language and education.
