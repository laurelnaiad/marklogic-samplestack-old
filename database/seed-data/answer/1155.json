{"Body":"<p>Sounds like a great research opportunity!</p>\n\n<p>No matter how orthographically long a language may be, one can assume that if you're texting it, there will be a shortened/abbreviated version of it. I mean, who really texts in <em>English?</em> I don't. I use </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>abbreviations for phrases (wtf, lol, omw, ty), </li>\n<li>shortened words (srsly, tmr, nm, thx), </li>\n<li>replacements for words (2, 4, u, yr, y, n) </li>\n<li>and other linguistic adulterations. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are estimates for text expansion/contraction in translation to give you an idea of how languages compare typographically. I don't know where these numbers come from, but they're on a <a href=\"http://www.universaldialog.com/html/expand.html\">zillion</a> <a href=\"http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/translation/articles/expansion-retraction.html\">translation</a> <a href=\"http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/2010/05/text-expansion-contraction-in-translation/\">companies'</a> websites, and they seem pretty accurate to me. </p>\n\n<p>So -- let's look at French, a language that I happen to have stumbled on some cool texting information about. French text expansion is about 15-20% -- that is, it takes 15-20% more space to write the same thing that English does. But just like in English, French speakers have <a href=\"http://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/10-top-french-abreviations-used-in-emails-sms\">abbreviated their way</a> to the <a href=\"http://french.about.com/library/writing/bl-texting.htm\">shortest SMS conversation possible</a> using </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>abbreviations for phrases (JTM = je t'aime = I love you, ily; MDR = mort(e) de rire = dying of laughter, lol; ), </li>\n<li>shortened words (bjr = bonjour = hello; C = C'est = It is), </li>\n<li>and replacements for words (p2k = pas de quoi = you're welcome, urw; A12C4 = Ã€ un de ces quatre = See you one of these days, c u l8r). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nAdd into the mix that there are a number of ways to text these days with the variety of phones available: keypad, sliding qwerty keyboard, touchscreen qwerty, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAh-FqEizi4\">swipe texting</a>. And other factors like T9 and <a href=\"http://damnyouautocorrect.com/\">autocorrect</a>.\n/END EDIT</p>\n\n<p>As far as the best language for \"the keyboard\": My guess would be English since that's the language it was designed for. Of course there actually exist many <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#Alternatives_to_QWERTY\">different keyboard layouts</a> to rival the standard QWERTY arrangement, most notably for English the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard\">Dvorak keyboard</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyman/\">Changing your computer's keyboard layout</a> can make it really easy to type almost any language. Maybe the same way <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/612/why-does-speech-speed-seem-to-vary-between-different-languages\">perceived speech speed varies with informational content of lexemes</a>, languages using \"native\" or adapted electronic input methods could probably type at the same speed as we can in English. Srsly, have u ever seen some1 <a href=\"http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~zxie3/ime.html\">type in ZH</a>?? </p>\n", "Id":"1155", "ParentId":"1154", "LastEditorUserId":"42", "CreationDate":"2011-12-14T22:51:50.207", "OwnerUserId":"42", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-12-15T15:21:28.340", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"108", "WebsiteUrl":"http://twitter.com/mollyocr", "Id":"42", "AccountId":"896571", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:04:13.347", "AboutMe":"<p>BA in Linguistics.
