{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There's actually been a lot of work on this kind of issue in morphosyntax.  I'm not sure exactly what the best starting point is, but you might want to take a look at <a href=\"http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/25/abstract1441.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Dost/Gribanova WCCFL paper</a> on Bulgarian, since you mention that as one of the languages of interest, and this paper directly addresses the issue of whether definiteness is an \"affix\".  I know there's been some subsequent research on definiteness in several of those languages, but I'm just not as familiar with it, so can't point to it as easily.  (But check on google scholar what papers cite this, and cite the Embick &amp; Noyer paper.)</p>\n", "Id":"615", "ParentId":"574", "CreationDate":"2011-09-29T15:44:57.237", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"345", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-29T15:44:57.237", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"4", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cog.jhu.edu/~rawlins/", "Id":"345", "AccountId":"513980", "CreationDate":"2011-09-28T22:20:39.537", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a linguist specializing in formal semantics and pragmatics.</p>\n", "Age":"35", "Location":"Baltimore, MD", "DownVotes":"1", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"490", "DisplayName":"kgr", "LastAccessDate":"2013-07-30T15:43:17.413"}}
