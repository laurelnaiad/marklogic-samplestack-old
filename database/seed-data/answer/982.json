{"Body":"<p><em>Ja, ja</em> in Dutch and German can express disbelief too.</p>\n\n<p>But I don't think <em>ja, ja, да, да, yeah yeah</em>, or <em>yeah, right</em> should really count; they do not express a double positive in the sense that one positive modifies the other or that both modify the same thing. They are just strong (because repeated) positives used <strong>ironically</strong>; they indicate disbelief—but is it an actual negation? You could use any locution to express a negative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illocution\" rel=\"nofollow\">illocution</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oh, I'm sure your grandmother won't be shocked if you announce that you're gay on Christmas Eve and kiss your girlfriend. She will no doubt be thrilled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As an alternative, it is possible that <em>ja, ja</em> originates in a polite phrase that no-one believes any more (instead of a faded ironic phrase).</p>\n\n<p>The fact that doubling a negative gives a positive is inherent in negations, because they invert whatever falls under their scope. Positives do not invert; they do not change what falls under their scope like that.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, who is to say what counts? Depending on one's definition, it could be argued that there are two positives, and that the whole is negative. I suppose it is a trivial matter at any rate.</p>\n", "Id":"982", "ParentId":"981", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2011-11-08T11:58:30.033", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-08T12:06:05.170", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-08T12:06:05.170", "Score":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
