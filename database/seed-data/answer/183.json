{"Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate_consonant\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article in question</a> makes some points that can help in telling the difference.

[in reference to one of the non-English examples]</p>\n  \n  <p>The acoustic difference between affricates and stop+fricative sequences is rate of amplitude increase of the frication noise, which is known as the rise time. Affricates have a short rise time to the peak frication amplitude while sequences of stop and fricative have relatively longer rise time (Howell &amp; Rosen 1983, Johnson 2003, Mitani et al. 2006).</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"183", "ParentId":"179", "LastEditorUserId":"77", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T22:58:42.353", "OwnerUserId":"77", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-16T14:34:12.110", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"232", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/aedia/", "Id":"77", "AccountId":"394997", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:41:02.527", "AboutMe":"<p>Visit the new <a href=\"http://ell.stackexchange.com\">English Language Learners</a> beta!</p>\n\n<p>I am a native speaker of American English. </p>\n\n<p>My background is in computer science.
