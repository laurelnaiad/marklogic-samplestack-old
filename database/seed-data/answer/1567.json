{"Body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> guidelines are probably the best choice.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a consortium which collectively\n  develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in\n  digital form. Its chief deliverable is a set of Guidelines which\n  specify encoding methods for machine-readable texts, chiefly in the\n  humanities, social sciences and linguistics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They define a modular XML schema to encode texts for a large number of use-cases, and I would guess it's the most widely used standard. There is no subset for grammar writing (there is one for dictionaries), but you could see if TEI Lite, or one of the other <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/\" rel=\"nofollow\">customizations</a> meets your needs, and adapt that if needed. Some XML editors also come with built-in TEI schema support, which may be useful.</p>\n", "Id":"1567", "ParentId":"1554", "LastEditorUserId":"444", "CreationDate":"2012-03-04T16:44:12.863", "OwnerUserId":"444", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-04T16:49:14.530", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"127", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Netherlands", "Id":"444", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"902812", "Views":"19", "Reputation":"934", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:14:27.380", "DisplayName":"arjan", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T14:07:55.473", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-04T16:49:14.530", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"127", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Netherlands", "Id":"444", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"902812", "Views":"19", "Reputation":"934", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:14:27.380", "DisplayName":"arjan", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T14:07:55.473", "AboutMe":""}}
