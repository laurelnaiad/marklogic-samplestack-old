{"Body":"<p>This is a real question that has a real answer published by real linguists to answer other real linguistics questions. (It also has applications in amateur linguistics and non-linguistics fields, like generating lorem ipsum text for design layout)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://crr.ugent.be/programs-data/wuggy\">http://crr.ugent.be/programs-data/wuggy</a>  This application will generate similar words given a pre-existing list of any language. It does not do a perfect job of generating phonotactically valid words, but it's close.</p>\n\n<p>A better way to generate random words is to work out the phonotactics of the target language-- which patterns of consonant and vowels are permitted, what is permitted as a coda, onset and nucleus.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally you'd choose sounds according to frequency in existing corpus, but a uniform distribution might be okay for a first approximation. Then you start generating words by choosing letters at random, constrained by the phonotactic rules.</p>\n\n<p>Markov chains work, but phonotactic rules are only kind of like markov chains. A (possible) markov chain only pays attention to the most recent letter could generate words that don't follow the coda-nucleus-onset patter and are too long or too short.</p>\n\n<p>To generate words in a language with interesting morphology, you'd need to select at random the relevant prefixes and suffixes and apply the necessary changes to allow those morphemes to be attached to the stem.</p>\n", "Id":"832", "ParentId":"821", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2011-10-17T14:34:36.467", "OwnerUserId":"20", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-18T14:11:25.853", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-18T14:11:25.853", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"72", "WebsiteUrl":"http://suburbandestiny.com/conlang", "Id":"20", "AccountId":"15651", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:53:42.550", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a programmer by day and an amateur linguist by night.</p>\n\n<p>I organize the Arlington Linguistics Book Club, where we read a wide variety of books that make the science of linguistic accessible to a popular audience.</p>\n", "Age":"41", "Location":"United States", "DownVotes":"6", "Views":"39", "Reputation":"1657", "DisplayName":"MatthewMartin", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T19:46:09.130"}}
