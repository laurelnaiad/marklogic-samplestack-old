So, no particular set of differences, apart from those described in the already mentioned Wikipedia article </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscan_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscan_language</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The basic things are the \"Tuscan Gorgia\" (phonetic), the strong use of impersonal constructs and the transformation of some verbs (\"io fo\"). Moreover, you would hear things as \"la mi' mamma\" instead of \"mia mamma\" (my mother). \nThis means that they use an article and shorten the possessive adjective when indicating people.\nTuscan people also tend to put an article before the forename when indicating someone, but I think this only applies to females. </p>\n\n<p>As already said, apart from those peculiarities, Tuscan has nothing particularly different form standard Italian, which was directly taken from it. As standard Italian, it shows much more interesting differences with other Italian dialects. This is due to the history of the peninsula, which was dominated by many people during time, and this has generated a great deal of dissimilarity. But, as for Tuscan, you may think of it as the one that, among all, became standard Italian.</p>\n", "Id":"3928", "ParentId":"3903", "CreationDate":"2013-06-27T20:05:08.367", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1895", "LastActivityDate":"2013-06-27T20:05:08.367", "CommentCount":"2"}
