{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>(This is mostly a step-by-step explanation of how to make use of the sources acattle pointed out.)</p>\n\n<p>The web interface of the <a href=\"http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a> offers a collocate search function. Just follow the link and you should see the web interface. Now choose 'Compare' under 'Display', this should make a 'Collocate' box appear immediately under the search box. Then choose 'List' under 'Display', and type in 'like' in the search box. Now press search and you should get the major collocates of 'like' and their frequency.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://corpus.byu.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Davies</a> also offers other corpora which you can access with the same interface. If that does not suit your needs you could get another corpus (for example from the sources acattle pointed out) and extract collocates/collocations with a concordancer (a program for accessing/searching corpora). I would recommend the free program <a href=\"http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/software.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Antconc</a>.</p>\n", "Id":"4056", "ParentId":"3762", "CreationDate":"2013-07-24T20:45:52.860", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2278", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-24T20:45:52.860", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"604", "WebsiteUrl":"", "DownVotes":"27", "Id":"2278", "AccountId":"1711803", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"1797", "CreationDate":"2013-07-22T17:11:57.903", "DisplayName":"robert", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:31:56.677", "AboutMe":""}}
