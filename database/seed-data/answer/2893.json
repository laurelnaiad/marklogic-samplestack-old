{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Yes. The more languages you know, the easier it generally is to learn new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Whether Sanskrit is <em>particularly</em> useful for learning German, I don't know Sanskrit well enough to judge, but this will probably depend on what other languages you already know. I would guess that if you already know English, that will benefit you a lot more in learning German than knowing Sanskrit will.</p>\n\n<p>But I'd still like to point out that I don't think genetic relation is necessarily the best/only indicator for how useful one language is for learning another. Certain aspects of languages can be similar across languages that are only remotely related, or even not at all.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Spanish and Japanese phonologies are much more similar than say, the Spanish and French ones are. That doesn't mean that Japanese is more useful than French for learning Spanish, but if the phonology is a \"hole\" which would otherwise be hard for you to master, your Japanese knowledge might just fill that hole.</p>\n\n<p>Whether there are similar ties between Sanskrit and German, I don't know. My guess is that the page you link to is targeting Indians trying to learn German, so I suspect that is why Sanskrit is taken up as a language that readers might know. I find it quite probable that knowledge about Sanskrit will benefit you in at least some aspects of learning German. However, I do find the examples listed on the page quite random and anecdotal in nature.</p>\n", "Id":"2893", "ParentId":"2880", "CreationDate":"2012-11-25T04:16:03.280", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"724", "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-25T04:16:03.280", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}}
