{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Here's Jessica Coon's analysis of how split ergativity works in Chol, a Mayan language:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The language has ergative/absolutive marking in simple (monoclausal) sentences.</li>\n<li>Ergative and genitive are marked identically.</li>\n<li>The subject of nominalizations is marked with ergative/genitive.</li>\n<li>Progressives are biclausal, and derived from nominalizations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus, in a perfective sentence with one argument, the argument will be marked with the absolutive (by point 1).  In a imperfective/progressive single-argument sentence, the argument will be marked with ergative/genitive (by 3 and 4).  In sentences with two arguments, ergative/absolutive marking is observed for both perfectives and imperfectives.</p>\n\n<p>The above analysis and underlying data are from <a href=\"http://www.kongresuak.ehu.es/p275-shergact/en/contenidos/informacion/ergativity_programme/en_program/adjuntos/Jessica_Coon.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">an abstract</a> (pdf); the author has several papers on the subject whose bibliographic information can be found in <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/jcoon/www/Jessica_Coon/Home_files/jcooncv.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">her CV</a> (pdf).</p>\n\n<p>So, at least in this language, the appearance of split ergativity is the result of a confluence of quite common linguistic traits (2, 3, and 4 above all occur independently of each other very often.)</p>\n", "Id":"1928", "ParentId":"1920", "CreationDate":"2012-05-13T08:06:28.043", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-13T08:06:28.043", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"57", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ecay/", "Id":"46", "AccountId":"211379", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:05:16.277", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
