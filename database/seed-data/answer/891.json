{"Body":"<p>The use of motion verbs to mark tense and/or aspect and/or modality is very common across the world's languages, both as part of serial verb constructions or as auxiliary verbs.</p>\n\n<p>Below are some non-Indo-European language examples.</p>\n\n<p>Sùpyìré, Niger-Congo family.\nSerial verb construction with the verb <em>sí</em>  'go' indicating futurity:</p>\n\n<pre>\n(1)  Zànhe sí dùfugé    kɛ̀  ɛ̀  gɛ̀     \n     rain  go maize.DEF spoil\n     \"The rain will spoil the maize.\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>Bambara, Niger-Congo family.\nHere the motion verb <em>na</em> 'come' is used as an auxiliary indicating futurity:</p>\n\n<pre>\n(2)  a   na   taa\n     3sg come go\n     \"He/she will go.\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>Grammaticalisation of the motion verbs 'go' and 'come' as future markers is common in Bantu languages. More examples in <a href=\"http://elanguage.net/journals/index.php/sal/article/download/1403/961\">this paper</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Squliq Atayal, Austronesian family, Taiwan.\nHere we see <em>musa'</em>  'go' used as an auxiliary to indicate irrealis/future:</p>\n\n<pre>\n(3)  musa’ m-nbu’  yaya’  =mu\n     IRR   AF-ill  mother =1S.GEN\n     \"My mother will be ill\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>George Lakoff (1993: 218) suggests that the metaphorical basis of describing time in terms of space is biologically determined: “In our visual systems, we have detectors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do not have detectors for time (whatever that could mean). Thus, it makes good biological sense that time should be understood in terms of things and motion.”</p>\n", "Id":"891", "ParentId":"886", "LastEditorUserId":"363", "CreationDate":"2011-10-27T11:10:20.900", "OwnerUserId":"363", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-27T12:01:54.110", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ümlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-27T12:01:54.110", "Score":"12", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"184", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Australia", "Id":"363", "DownVotes":"11", "AccountId":"948668", "Views":"67", "Reputation":"3682", "CreationDate":"2011-10-02T11:34:38.250", "DisplayName":"Gaston Ümlaut", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T22:46:37.857", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a rock climber &amp; a linguist.</p>\n"}}
