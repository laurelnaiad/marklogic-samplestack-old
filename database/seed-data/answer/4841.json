{"Body":"<p>I'm fairly certain it's not a quirk of Pinyin. The first character of Kunming, 昆, is unambiguously pinyinized as \"Kūn\". I speak some Mandarin, and I would never pronounce that like \"Kwee\", and nor have I ever spoken to a Chinese person who would. When I travelled in Yunnan, I never encountered the pronunciation that you've described. </p>\n\n<p>That said - you might be in a different part of the province. You could be encountering some regional dialect changes to standard Mandarin. </p>\n\n<p>One feature of Yi (a local minority ethnic group)-influenced dialects of Mandarin is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan#Languages\" rel=\"nofollow\">lack of distinction between /n/ and /ŋ/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe what you're hearing comes from the combination of the first tone, and the distorted, slightly nasalized /n/ in Kūn, when pronounced by Yunnan speakers.</p>\n", "Id":"4841", "ParentId":"4832", "LastEditorUserId":"2671", "CreationDate":"2013-11-03T01:44:01.410", "OwnerUserId":"2671", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-11-03T03:07:18.127", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://mattseidholz.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nYdae.jpg", "Id":"2671", "AccountId":"3528707", "CreationDate":"2013-11-03T01:35:48.637", "AboutMe":"", "Location":"Hong Kong", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"9", "DisplayName":"Matt Seidholz", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-04T09:18:55.370"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-11-03T03:07:18.127", "Score":"0", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://mattseidholz.com", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nYdae.jpg", "Id":"2671", "AccountId":"3528707", "CreationDate":"2013-11-03T01:35:48.637", "AboutMe":"", "Location":"Hong Kong", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"2", "Reputation":"9", "DisplayName":"Matt Seidholz", "LastAccessDate":"2013-11-04T09:18:55.370"}}
