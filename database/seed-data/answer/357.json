{"Body":"<p>If there are two million speakers of Esperanto (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>; numbers disputed) then the extent and tenacity of the constructed language is in itself noteworthy. Hangul (written Korean) is arguably the only other language construct (designed by scholars of the court of King Sejong the Great) with such extent and tenacity.</p>\n\n<p>Esperanto gives linguists the equivalent of the motor skill of <a href=\"http://www.physorg.com/news167053363.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Not forgetting how to ride a bicycle</a>. There might not be a lot of examples of this kind of skill, but at least one example exists.</p>\n\n<p>Esperanto and Hangul help linguists ask some deep questions. Is there some learning feature that helped them survive? (Esperanto and Hangul are extremely regular in nature.) Can speakers and writers express novel and complex concepts? Can the language or alphabet be extended?</p>\n\n<p>So my semi-serious answer to the OP would be: \"To keep linguists employed.\"</p>\n", "Id":"357", "ParentId":"354", "LastEditorUserId":"225", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T14:17:02.453", "OwnerUserId":"225", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-21T14:36:05.580", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "Location":"Charlotte, NC", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"225", "AccountId":"239923", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"385", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T13:52:43.483", "DisplayName":"rajah9", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-07T16:34:51.110", "AboutMe":"<p>Contract financial developer at a large bank in Charlotte, NC.</p>\n", "Age":"55"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-21T14:36:05.580", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"8", "Location":"Charlotte, NC", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"225", "AccountId":"239923", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"385", "CreationDate":"2011-09-21T13:52:43.483", "DisplayName":"rajah9", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-07T16:34:51.110", "AboutMe":"<p>Contract financial developer at a large bank in Charlotte, NC.</p>\n", "Age":"55"}}
