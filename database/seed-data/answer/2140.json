{"Body":"<p>An example, though probably not a very good one, is \"lioness\" vs. \"lion\". \"Lion\" can refer to either male or female lions, whereas \"lioness\" refers to only female lions. In this example \"lioness\" is marked and \"lion\" is unmarked. This is because \"lion\" is the more general term.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is \"young\" vs. \"old\". Here \"old\" is less obviously unmarked, while \"young\" is marked. This is a better example. Normally, when I ask a question, I ask \"How old is Jim?\", because \"old\" is the unmarked term. This is rather general. I do not appear to be making a presumption about Jim. Conversely, if I asked \"How young is Jim?\", that presupposes that Jim is young. This is because \"young\" is the marked term.</p>\n\n<p>So marked vs. unmarked means that two terms with opposite meaning are asymmetrical in their meaning, and that one of them is more general and dominant.</p>\n\n<p>Of course markedness varies across languages, there are surely some in which \"young\" is unmarked.</p>\n", "Id":"2140", "ParentId":"2137", "LastEditorUserId":"1119", "CreationDate":"2012-06-19T13:19:28.013", "OwnerUserId":"1119", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-06-19T13:58:54.940", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1119", "AccountId":"279842", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"221", "CreationDate":"2012-06-19T13:19:28.030", "DisplayName":"Miles Rout", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-23T23:23:51.220"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-19T13:58:54.940", "Score":"6", "CommentCount":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1119", "AccountId":"279842", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"221", "CreationDate":"2012-06-19T13:19:28.030", "DisplayName":"Miles Rout", "LastAccessDate":"2013-04-23T23:23:51.220"}}
