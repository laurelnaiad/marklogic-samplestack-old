{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>The simple answer to the question is NO, there is no established term such as <em>determiner group</em> used to denote the word combinations in the question, and there is a reason why no term has been established to denote such word combinations. This reason is that the relevant words (e.g. <em>my three</em>, <em>both the</em>, <em>all the many</em>) hardly qualify as a unit of syntax. At most, one can acknowledge that they form a <em>string</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Such word combinations qualify as a constituent in no theory of syntax (that I am aware of), not in phrase structure grammars and not in dependency grammars. Furthermore, such word combinations do not qaulify as chains, that is, they do not qualify as <em>catenae</em>: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_%28linguistics%29</a>. In contrast, verb predicates (e.g. <em>will have fixed</em>, <em>has been fixed</em>, <em>may have been being fixed</em>) do qualify as chains of words, as catenae. The fact that determiner strings qualify neither as constituents nor as catenae means that it is more difficult to denote such combinations with a particular syntactic term. Theoretical syntax tends to focus on word combinations that are recognizable units.</p>\n\n<p>But there is nothing to stop one from establishing a new term, e.g. <em>determiner string</em> or <em>determiner group</em>. In fact, since there is no pre-established term for such combinations, one has more freedom to call them whatever one wants. </p>\n", "Id":"6242", "ParentId":"6212", "CreationDate":"2013-12-24T04:34:37.260", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-24T04:34:37.260", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2247", "AccountId":"3045491", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"565", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T16:52:54.170", "DisplayName":"Tim Osborne", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T04:26:20.267"}}
