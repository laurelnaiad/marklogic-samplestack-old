{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>As Lyle Campbell writes in his intro textbook on Historical Linguistics (2004), until the 1970's the general view was that historical linguistics should describe rather than explain, cf. a quote from Lehmann 1962 that \"a linguist establishes the facts of change, leaving its explanation to the anthropologist.\" Luckily, the situation has changed, and now \"most current research is directed at revealing the factors which help to explain language change\" (Campbell 2004, p. 313). See chapter 11 \"Explaining linguistic change\" for further study.</p>\n\n<p>Practically all major textbooks on historical linguistics provide some explanation of sound, morphological, syntactic, semantic etc. change.</p>\n", "Id":"901", "ParentId":"893", "CreationDate":"2011-10-28T21:36:03.850", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"445", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-28T21:36:03.850", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
