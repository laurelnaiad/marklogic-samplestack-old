{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>This phenomenon is called <strong>language continuum</strong> or <strong>dialect continuum</strong>. According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In sociolinguistics, a language continuum is said to exist when two or more different languages or dialects merge one into the other(s) without a definable boundary. This happens, for example, across large parts of India. Historically, it also happened in various parts of Europe, for example in a line stretching from Portuguese to Walloon (in Belgium); from Portuguese to the southern Italian dialects; and between German and Dutch. Within the last 100 years or so, however, the increasing dominance of nation-states and their standard languages has been steadily eliminating the non-standard dialects of which these language continua were formed, making the boundaries ever more abrupt and well-defined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That WP article cites several examples, from different language families, around the world.</p>\n", "Id":"898", "ParentId":"896", "CreationDate":"2011-10-28T13:38:48.213", "Score":"8", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"22", "LastActivityDate":"2011-10-28T13:38:48.213", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
