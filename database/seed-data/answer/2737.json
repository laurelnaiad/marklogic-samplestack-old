{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Depends a lot on the language and analysis. Tone transcription is a messy area with no universal agreement. The most common way is probably to transcribe tone on the nucleus, although where the tone goes with a diphthong/triphthong is generally governed more by convention than phonetic reality. This method also doesn't have one common way of handling syllables with no nucleus. Others transcribe tone with tone letters or contour diacritics after each syllable. This approach is less common.</p>\n", "Id":"2737", "ParentId":"2732", "CreationDate":"2012-10-22T05:07:03.117", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1185", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-22T05:07:03.117", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"42", "Location":"KiTTYLand", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1185", "AccountId":"559628", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"456", "CreationDate":"2012-07-13T00:21:32.883", "DisplayName":"ROBOKiTTY", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-05T16:26:27.617", "AboutMe":"<p>Primarily work in LOLCODE, Java, C#, and C++.</p>\n"}}
