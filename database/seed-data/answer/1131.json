{"Body":"<p>You might want to look into Robert Kirchner's \"Lazy\" (1997: 104) constraints in optimality theory, which posit that surface forms which require more \"articulatory effort\" are more marked. This accounts for processes such as postvocalic lenition of Spanish voiced stops (e.g. /lobo/ 'wolf' becomes [loβo]). In this example, the rationale that [β] requires less articulatory effort than [b] is simply that it requires less facial motion, and therefore less muscular exertion and energy expenditure, to close one's lips partially (forming the fricative) than to close them completely (forming the stop).</p>\n\n<p>If I recall correctly, Kirchner assigns scores to different phones according to how much effort they require to produce, and his constraints take these scores into account. This might help answer your question about how to measure the cost of sound-production.</p>\n\n<p>Kirchner, Robert (1997). <a href=\"http://www.ualberta.ca/~kirchner/contfaith.pdf\">Contrastiveness and faithfulness</a>.
