{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>As Mark Beadles says in a comment, declinability seems relevant mostly for subordinating conjunctions, since these make the subclause into a POS of main clauses or other subclauses (Not sure if any languages use anything similar to cases to coordinate main clauses). Also, declinability seems mostly relevant for (let me know if there is a better word) nominalizing subordinating conjunctions (English 'that') since other subordinating conjunctions almost always head adverbial phrases.</p>\n\n<p>If we stretch the definitions and classify Japanese nominalizers 'koto' (and 'no') as nominalizing conjunctions and also classify (certain) Japanese particles as case markers (although these are usually analyzed as syntactic constructs, not morphological declensions), we <em>could</em> argue that Japanese has declinable conjunctions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kare-ga kita koto-ga saiwai datta.<br/>\n  He-NOM came that-NOM luck was.<br/>\n  It was lucky that he came. </p>\n  \n  <p>Kare-ga kuru no-wo matte-iru.<br/>\n  He-NOM comes that-ACC waiting is(/am/are).<br/>\n  (I) am waiting for him to come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"2205", "ParentId":"2187", "CreationDate":"2012-07-04T01:10:04.293", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"724", "LastActivityDate":"2012-07-04T01:10:04.293", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"33", "DownVotes":"8", "Id":"724", "AccountId":"482018", "Views":"10", "Reputation":"709", "CreationDate":"2012-01-29T05:39:01.393", "DisplayName":"dainichi", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T02:01:24.110"}}
