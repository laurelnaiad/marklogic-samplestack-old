{"Body":"<p>Vietnamese names, like Chinese, have <strong>no specific name set</strong>. So the choice depends on the parents or the person who gives the name. They can choose <strong>any word</strong> they like to combine into the name. But Vietnamese name have no limit in number of syllables like Chinese names, although most will have 3-4 syllables.</p>\n\n<p>There's <strong>no restriction in gender</strong> of the name either, but most will have some <em>bias</em> in gender.</p>\n\n<p>For example when hearing the names such as <em>\"Mai\", \"Lan\", \"Thúy\", \"Vân\"</em>... you can guess that they are a woman's name most of the time because they　describe things such as flowers and birds... they feel more \"feminine\" and \"soft\", albeit there are men who were given those names too.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand names such as <em>\"Trung\", \"Hùng\", \"Dũng\", \"Mạnh\"</em>... would have 95% chance to be a man's name because they express vigor, strength.</p>\n\n<p>Most other names are more neutral in gender. The possibility for <em>\"Phúc\", \"Tú\", \"Phương\"...</em> to be a man's/woman's name might be 50/50 whereas <em>\"Thanh\", \"Hà\"</em>... perhaps are a bit more \"womanly\" because in 55-60% of the cases they are a woman's name</p>\n\n<p>In the past women often had \"Thị\" and men usually had \"Văn\" as a middle name so you could infer sex information from that. But nowadays those middle names aren't favorable any more, replaced with more \"fashionable\" middle names, and there are many names don't have middle names, so you can't get gender hints from that any more. But when going with an appropriate given name, sometimes it will make the gender bias stronger. For example <em>\"Anh\" and \"Thanh\"</em> are neutral names, but with <em>\"Vân\"</em> as middle name then <em>\"Vân Anh\" or \"Vân Thanh\"</em> would be a woman's name. Or <em>\"Dương\"</em> is more or less a man's name, but <em>\"Thùy Dương\"</em> would be a woman's name</p>\n\n<p>Note that the percentages are only from the sense of a Vietnamese number, not any specific statistics so it may not reflect exactly the actual number.</p>\n", "Id":"4633", "ParentId":"2415", "LastEditorUserId":"51", "CreationDate":"2013-10-07T08:28:37.267", "OwnerUserId":"2313", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-07T10:02:31.243", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1436", "WebsiteUrl":"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Hippietrail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExcaS.jpg", "Id":"51", "AccountId":"250783", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:15:02.967", "AboutMe":"<p>Travelling armchair linguist.</p>\n\n<p>Never studied in an institution but read books and web with probably more breadth than depth.</p>\n\n<p>Always on the road surviving in a strange foreign language, currently Mongolian and Mandarin Chinese.</p>\n\n<p>And I collect dictionaries.</p>\n", "Location":"Beijing, China", "DownVotes":"65", "Views":"221", "Reputation":"4918", "DisplayName":"hippietrail", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T09:27:54.697"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-07T10:02:31.243", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"2", "WebsiteUrl":"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/2313/lu-vnh-phuc", "Id":"2313", "AccountId":"433754", "CreationDate":"2013-08-03T04:06:17.960", "AboutMe":"<p>Not a linguist but interested in linguistics</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"Vietnam", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"151", "DisplayName":"Lưu Vĩnh Phúc", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-29T14:44:05.563"}}
