{"Body":"<p>According to Ibrihim, 1973, p.61:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the noun is animate, natural gender tends to dictate grammatical gender.</li>\n<li>The borrowed word tends to take the gender of the native word it replaces.</li>\n<li>If the borrowed word happens to have a suffix that the borrowing language uses as a gender marker, the suffix tends to dictate gender.</li>\n<li>If the borrowed word rhymes with one or more native words, the latter tend to dictate gender.</li>\n<li>The default assignment is the borrowing language's unmarked gender.</li>\n<li>Rarely, the word retains the gender it had in the donor language.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Also, sometimes the choice is totally arbitrary, and may be different indifferent dialects. It may also change with time.</p>\n", "Id":"3698", "ParentId":"3044", "LastEditorUserId":"1055", "CreationDate":"2013-05-11T18:13:33.543", "OwnerUserId":"2048", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-12T07:34:27.133", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"102", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Seoul, South Korea", "Id":"1055", "DownVotes":"9", "AccountId":"1453460", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"1947", "CreationDate":"2012-05-29T05:50:57.073", "DisplayName":"acattle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:59:41.983", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently studying for an MA in Computational Linguistics even though my background is not in linguistics. I discovered Computational Linguistics while receiving my B.A.Sc in Software Engineering when I built a basic bigram parser for an AI assignment. This caused me to become interested in linguistics and to take a few introductory level courses. I currently have completed my first year of my masters and am currently looking for a thesis topic.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-12T07:34:27.133", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2048", "AccountId":"2754933", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"41", "CreationDate":"2013-05-11T16:56:43.793", "DisplayName":"aaa", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-16T10:16:42.093"}}
