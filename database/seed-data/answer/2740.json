{"Body":"<p>Perhaps it's not that recent, but for reference - an exchange between Hauser, Chomsky and Finch on one side, and Jackendoff and Pinker on the other: <a href=\"http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002422.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002422.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In short: Chomsky's hypothesis is that UG contains nothing but recursion. Jackendoff and Pinker point out that our visual cognition is also recursive, so recursion can't belong to UG (unless we believe that these two types of recursion evolved completely independently - but why should we assume that?). If we take the Chomsky's premise about UG, and combine it with the J&amp;G's observation, we end up with the conclusion that there is no UG.</p>\n", "Id":"2740", "ParentId":"6", "LastEditorUserId":"1426", "CreationDate":"2012-10-22T23:58:08.907", "OwnerUserId":"1426", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-10-23T10:02:39.310", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1426", "AccountId":"134622", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"85", "CreationDate":"2012-10-20T17:38:59.567", "DisplayName":"michau", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-16T17:43:22.383"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-23T10:02:39.310", "Score":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"1", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"1426", "AccountId":"134622", "Views":"1", "Reputation":"85", "CreationDate":"2012-10-20T17:38:59.567", "DisplayName":"michau", "LastAccessDate":"2013-05-16T17:43:22.383"}}
