However, you will be a native speaker of both languages.</p>\n\n<p>One example is my son, growing up in an English-speaking country.  All of his friends speak English, and I myself am a native speaker of English.  So he is also a native speaker of English, as much as I myself, or any of his friends.  But he gained a degree of proficiency in his mother's language long before he spoke a single sentence of English.  So he is the perfect example of someone who had a mother tongue, then became native in something else.</p>\n", "Id":"2411", "ParentId":"2406", "CreationDate":"2012-08-11T02:37:29.710", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-11T02:37:29.710", "CommentCount":"1", "comments":[]}
