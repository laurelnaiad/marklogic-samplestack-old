Predictable variants are termed <strong>allophones</strong> -- the sounds are in <strong>complementary distribution</strong> because the context where one variant appears is the complement of the context where the other sound appears.\" <br></p>\n\n<p>Ladefoged \"Vowels and Consonants\" (2001: 193--4) \"If we are thinking in acoustic terms, even <strong>?</strong> is not so far from <strong>t</strong>. On a spectrogram both correspond to very similar gaps in the pattern. Linguists have a term for a group of similar sounds of this kind. They call it a phoneme...We talk of the difference between <em>kit</em> and <em>pit</em> being the use of the phoneme /<strong>k</strong>/ as opposed to the phoneme /<strong>p</strong>/. There is usually no harm in expressing htings this way. But it is important to remember that it is a kind of shorthand. A phoneme is not a single sound but a group of sounds.<br></p>\n\n<p>Silverman (2006: 215) \"For our purposes though, the phoneme is not an entity on any level—functional,\nphonetic, psychological, or even metaphorical. Rather, at best, <strong>phoneme</strong> is merely a\nterminological expedient that might capture the functional non-distinctness of any\ncollection of phonetic properties that allomorphically alternates. And yet, despite its\nexpedience, I choose to avoid the term altogether, because terminological expedients\nhave a demonstrated tendency to become reified by their users.\"<br></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/PhoneticStructure.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ladefoged (ms.)</a> \"Perhaps the most startling conspiracy — one that seems to have deceived by far\nthe majority  of linguists — is the appearance of <strong>phonemes</strong>. Accounts of human\nbehavior in terms of phonemes are nearly always examples of what has been called\nthe psychologist's fallacy — the notion that because an  act can  be described  in  a\ngiven  way  that it is necessarily  structured  in  that way. As will be shown  later,\nphoneme size units play only a minor role in human behavioral acts such as normal\nspeaking  and  listening. They  are, nevertheless, great imaginary  objects for use in \ndescribing linguistic aspects of speech.\"<br></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hum.uchicago.edu/~jagoldsm/Papers/dissertation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goldsmith (1976: 17--8)</a> \"The standard linguistic assumption regarding the nature of phonological representations...implies that the process of language acquisition and of perception includes the development of the ability to take a representation and slice it vertically into columns...Let us call this assumption the \"Absolute Slicing Hypothesis\" ...
