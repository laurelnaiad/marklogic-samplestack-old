Although we analyze speech as a series of discrete segments, it's certainly a continuum on the surface, and therefore all phones within words are at least somewhat affected by coarticulation.</p>\n\n<p>To return to your specific example, all this means that a person who can pronounce [r] well in isolation may still have trouble pronouncing words containing the sound, because they are unaccustomed to 1) the act of transitioning between [r] and another sound, and 2) the subtle ways that adjacent sounds affect how you pronounce [r].</p>\n", "Id":"1134", "ParentId":"1133", "CreationDate":"2011-12-09T22:59:54.117", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"544", "LastActivityDate":"2011-12-09T22:59:54.117", "CommentCount":"1"}
