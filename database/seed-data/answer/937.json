{"Body":"<p>I think that the first thing you'd need to do is actually pose your question - as there are so many different possibilities as to what can be done with elicitation these days. As a general rule any elicitation must involve non-linguist stimulus, such as a video, to prevent the results being tainted by translation. The best place to look for what is often looked at to be the state of the art is <a href=\"http://www.mpi.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegan</a> - projects like the \"put project\" and the spatial relations projects are classics in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Another vanguard approach is to use non-linguistic evidence of linguistic structures. Gesture is often a popular secondary evidence of the cognitive salience of a syntactic or semantic property.
