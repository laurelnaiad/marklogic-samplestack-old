{"Body":"<p>Preparation for The International Linguistics Olympiad (and national olympiads before that) generally consists of two parts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>problem solving - find all linguistic problems that you can find and try to solve them. There are some on <a href=\"http://ioling.org/\">ioling.org</a>, and perhaps the NACLO ones are also available</p></li>\n<li><p>theoretical knowledge - this is not a strict requirement, but it may help you a lot. Wikipedia is completely sufficient source (together with its reference materials, of course). You can start by exploring the major fields of theoretical linguistics - phonetics, phonology, morphology. You will end up reading a lot of related articles.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Having theoretical knowledge may or may not help you on the olympiad. For example, at least 3 of  the absolute winners of the Olympiad had only basic linguistic knowledge, but were great problem-solvers. But recently linguistic knowledge has proved to be a major benefit. </p>\n", "Id":"103", "ParentId":"87", "LastEditorUserId":"80", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T11:20:23.907", "OwnerUserId":"80", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-14T11:39:59.380", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"http://techblog.bozho.net", "Id":"80", "AccountId":"70258", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:45:02.257", "AboutMe":"<p>Bozhidar Bozhanov - Senior Java developer (<a href=\"http://bozho.net/cv/Bozhidar_Bozhanov_CV.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CV</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Creator of <a href=\"http://welshare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://welshare.com</a></p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Sofia, Bulgaria", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"753", "DisplayName":"Bozho", "LastAccessDate":"2012-08-08T11:21:15.973"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T11:39:59.380", "Score":"7", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"14", "WebsiteUrl":"http://techblog.bozho.net", "Id":"80", "AccountId":"70258", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T23:45:02.257", "AboutMe":"<p>Bozhidar Bozhanov - Senior Java developer (<a href=\"http://bozho.net/cv/Bozhidar_Bozhanov_CV.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">CV</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Creator of <a href=\"http://welshare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://welshare.com</a></p>\n", "Age":"27", "Location":"Sofia, Bulgaria", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"29", "Reputation":"753", "DisplayName":"Bozho", "LastAccessDate":"2012-08-08T11:21:15.973"}}
