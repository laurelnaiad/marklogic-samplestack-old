{"Body":"<p>I can't add anything to the discussion from an academic point of view but I wanted to share my personal experience as an intermediate-level Korean-as-a-second-language speaker.</p>\n\n<p>I was taught <em>how</em> to pronounce the ㅔ and ㅐ differently but my teacher said that since young Koreans don't distinguish between them there wasn't much point to it.</p>\n\n<p>ㅔ is a relaxed mouth shape (same as for pronouncing ㅓ) while ㅐ is more of a wide, smiley mouth shape (same as for pronouncing ㅏ). Pronouncing them back to back I can notice subtle differences, but they are quite similar.</p>\n\n<p>I like to contrast the difference between these two vowels with the different between ㅓ and ㅗ. These too differ only by mouth shape (relaxed vs. rounded, respectively). In very limited contexts in casual and colloquial speech I've noticed that these vowels too are occasionally substituted for each other.</p>\n", "Id":"2634", "ParentId":"2619", "LastEditorUserId":"1055", "CreationDate":"2012-09-29T08:50:41.977", "OwnerUserId":"1055", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-29T08:56:17.677", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"102", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Seoul, South Korea", "Id":"1055", "DownVotes":"9", "AccountId":"1453460", "Views":"21", "Reputation":"1947", "CreationDate":"2012-05-29T05:50:57.073", "DisplayName":"acattle", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-17T00:59:41.983", "AboutMe":"<p>I am currently studying for an MA in Computational Linguistics even though my background is not in linguistics.
