{"Body":"<p>In Cantonese songs, one of two things happen — the tones are preserved in a particular way, or the tones are ignored. The paper <a href=\"http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/chan9/articles/bls13.htm\">Tone and melody in Cantonese</a> by Marjorie K.M. Chan has some information on how often the tones are preserved, showing that the tonal contrasts are largely preserved by the melody in a small sample of 90s HK pop songs. The paper is about the relative pitches of adjacent syllables, but there is a second mechanism for preserving tones in the melody.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, in Cantonese songs which preserve contour tones, this occurs by applying a grace note to the syllable, so that it starts below the notated tone. You can hear this in, say, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Uw5OeD3Vc4E#t=77s\">男兒當自強</a>, where the rising contour tone syllables 膽, 打, 似 are sung with a lower grace note. The grace note is on the previous note of the scale in 膽, but a semitone below the notated note on 打.<br>\nI don't know of any singer who tries to preserve the Cantonese low-falling tone (tone 4) with an upper grace note, though.</p>\n\n<p>This manner of preserving tonal information can be applied even when the original melody was not written for the lyrics, as in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pur28DxPhj8\">每天爱你多一些</a>, which was written for a Japanese song.</p>\n\n<p>Off the top of my head, I can't think of a Cantonese song which ignores contour tones altogether, although sometimes you hear Happy Birthday sung with the Mandarin lyrics in their Cantonese readings (祝你生日快樂 etc.), and I think the contours are not generally respected.</p>\n\n<p>Many Mandarin songs, on the other hand, obliterate tone distinctions and don't try to preserve them in the melody. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6lbPgfKK7m4#t=55s\">朋友</a> by 周華健 is an example of this.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that the greater number of contour tones in Cantonese is the reason why singers at least try to preserve the contour/level contrast. It would be interesting to get data on whether singers in other tone systems — Thai and Vietnamese, for instance — preserve contour tones or not.</p>\n", "Id":"3311", "ParentId":"3309", "LastEditorUserId":"111", "CreationDate":"2013-03-04T06:45:51.940", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-03-04T11:58:07.190", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"308", "DownVotes":"10", "Id":"111", "AccountId":"514008", "Views":"172", "Reputation":"5430", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T09:33:29.710", "DisplayName":"Alenanno", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:38:35.883", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a student majoring in Languages (branch: Linguistics), currently working as a freelance translator.
