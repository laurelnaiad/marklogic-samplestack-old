The idea is that the ancestors of the Indo-Europeans counted on the four fingers (not including the thumb) of one hand. *oktō is a dual meaning “two spans”. The word for “nine” introduces a “new” set of four. The mentioned phonological objections are not insurmountable. The initial laryngeal has been posited mainly to explain the initial vowel in Gk. ἐννέα but this is not the only possible explanation (prefixed ἐν according to Schwyzer, Griech. Gr. I, 591). In principle you could reconstruct the PIE word for “nine” as *newṃ (Latin novem) and regard this as the neuter singular of *new- , with secondary assimilation of n…m to n….n in Germanic etc. This is all pretty much mainstream IE theory; of course, none of this is certain.</p>\n", "Id":"6143", "ParentId":"6133", "CreationDate":"2013-12-14T14:56:05.480", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2556", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-14T14:56:05.480", "CommentCount":"4"}
