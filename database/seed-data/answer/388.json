This involves the insertion of <em>a</em> (homophonous with the preposition translated \"to\"; whether it is a preposition in this context is debatable) before a direct object:</p>\n\n<pre>\n(1)  He     visto a Maria\n    *He     visto   Maria\n     I.have seen  A M.\n\n(2) *He     visto a la  mesa\n     He     visto   la  mesa\n     I.have seen  A the table\n</pre>\n\n<p>(The judgments given correspond to most but not all dialects of Spanish.  Whether a non-human living being gets <em>a personal</em> is, as I understand, a particular locus of dialect and speaker variation.)</p>\n\n<p>This is of course orthogonal to gender, which is marked in the usual Romance way on nouns, adjectives, determiners and pronouns.</p>\n", "Id":"388", "ParentId":"384", "CreationDate":"2011-09-22T02:32:12.347", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-22T02:32:12.347", "CommentCount":"8"}
