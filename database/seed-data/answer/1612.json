{"Body":"<p>I don't know how the phone system works in Poland, and besides that's a question for a telephony user group or something, not a linguistics question. So I will address the linguistic point.</p>\n\n<p>Many languages other than English have a case system for marking the grammatical roles of words like nouns. In most instances this also applies to proper nouns like personal names. Case-marking in Polish takes the form of suffixes that are appended to the base form of the word. For the masculine name Dawid, the forms are:</p>\n\n<p>Nominative   <strong>Dawid</strong>   = David as a subject<br>\nAccusative   <strong>Dawida</strong>  = David as a direct object, to David<br>\nDative       <strong>Dawidowi</strong> = David as an indirect object, to/for David<br>\nGenitive     <strong>Dawida</strong>  = David's, of David<br>\nInstrumental <strong>Dawidem</strong> = with/by David<br>\nLocative     <strong>Dawidzie</strong>  = at/on/to David<br>\nVocative     <strong>Dawidzie</strong>  = O David!  </p>\n\n<p>Apart from that, there exist prepositions, as English <em>to</em>, <em>from</em> etc. The verb <em>(za)dzwonić</em> 'call' takes the preposition <em>do</em> 'to' which requires the genitive, so the whole phrase is <em>(za)dzwoń do Dawida</em> 'call to David-Gen.'.</p>\n", "Id":"1612", "ParentId":"1611", "LastEditorUserId":"794", "CreationDate":"2012-03-10T01:29:57.233", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-10T14:45:13.780", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"46", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www2.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/kjasis/~stachowski.kamil", "Location":"Cracow, Poland", "Id":"794", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"414249", "Views":"49", "Reputation":"1128", "CreationDate":"2012-02-24T07:50:20.713", "DisplayName":"kamil-s", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-23T10:10:41.103", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-10T14:45:13.780", "Score":"5", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
