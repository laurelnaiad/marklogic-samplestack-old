{"Body":"<p>Latin has many examples of postpositions but was characteristically a prepositional language: </p>\n\n<p><strong>cum</strong> (and rarely some other prepositions) can come either before or after its object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mēcum   / cum  mē   quocum     / cum  quo     quoad    / ad quo  \nme with / with me   which with / with which   which to / to which  \n\"with me\"           \"with which\"              \"to which\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>causā</strong> and <strong>grātiā</strong> come after their object (though these are in origin ablative nouns):  </p>\n\n<pre><code>exemplī grātiā           urbis causā\nexample sake-abl.        town  reason-abl. \n\"for example\"            \"for the sake of the city\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and adjectives modifying prepositional objects can often precede the preposition, making a sort of bracketed construction:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>magnā cum  laude     magno cum  periculo   tristi cum  corde\ngreat with praise    great with danger     sad    with heart\n\"with great praise\"  \"at great risk\"       \"with a sad heart\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This situation obtained in Latin due to <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=g98ndC5vzi8C&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;ots=HJSYQUcqTI&amp;dq=%22latin%20word%20order%22%20prepositions&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q=postposition&amp;f=false\">a transition in word order from earlier left-branching (head-final) to later right-branching (head-initial)</a>. The related Italic languages Oscan and especially <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=lq-mkL23oh8C&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;ots=HdeNp2cEjo&amp;dq=umbrian%20postpositions&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q=umbrian%20postpositions&amp;f=false\">Umbrian had many more postpositions than Latin</a>, for example. This supports jogloran's point in his answer that the head parameter of a language dictates whether it has post- or pre-positions; only during transitions will you find both. Of course, languages are always in transition :)</p>\n", "Id":"1764", "ParentId":"1762", "LastEditorUserId":"537", "CreationDate":"2012-04-06T17:00:45.407", "OwnerUserId":"537", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-04-06T17:07:55.663", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-04-06T17:07:55.663", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"556", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.markbeadles.com/", "Id":"537", "AccountId":"297827", "CreationDate":"2011-11-27T02:50:39.717", "AboutMe":"<p>Polymathic renaissance redneck</p>\n", "Age":"47", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"22", "Views":"30", "Reputation":"3876", "DisplayName":"Mark Beadles", "LastAccessDate":"2013-02-02T04:23:30.703"}}
