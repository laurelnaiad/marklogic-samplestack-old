{"Body":"<p>Modern research into grammar formalisms <em>have</em> developed analyses for many of the constructions you deem to be impossible or difficult to account for. </p>\n\n<p>Out of your list, 'tense matching' and 'subject-verb matching', 'pronoun-reference' (usually called anaphora resolution), 'general \"and\" and \"or\"' (coordination) have definitely been addressed in many formalisms including generative grammar, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), and many others. (I am not sure what you mean by verb ellipsis, but if you mean:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He baked and she ate a delicious chocolate cake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>this, too, is well-studied and well-addressed by computationally efficient methods in the literature.)</p>\n\n<p>As for the extension to CFGs which you propose,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A+ B -> B A+</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>can (I think) be expressed in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_grammar\">linear indexed grammar (LIG)</a>, so you're right that the generative power required is strictly greater than context-free.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm not even sure this is a valid generalisation â€” not all modifiers can occur on either side of the verb phrase (at least not without changing the denotation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I honestly believe he is a crook.</p>\n  \n  <p>?I believe he is a crook honestly.</p>\n  \n  <p>Frankly I don't give a damn.</p>\n  \n  <p>*I don't give a damn frankly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"1627", "ParentId":"1625", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "CreationDate":"2012-03-13T08:38:38.523", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-13T11:50:39.487", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
