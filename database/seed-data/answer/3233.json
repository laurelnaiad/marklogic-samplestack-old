As you said, the root from which the word <strong>shabbath</strong> is built, is different from that of <strong>sheva</strong>. The first is constructed from the root <em>shin-bet-<strong>tav</em></strong> (<em>sīn-bā’-<strong>tā’</em></strong> in Arabic) and the second comes from the root <em>shin-bet-<strong>'ayin</em></strong> (<em>sīn-bā’-<strong>’ayn</em></strong> in Arabic). </p>\n\n<p><strong>שבת</strong> (<strong>shabbath</strong>) means <em>to rest, to stop working</em> and that is why the last day (seventh day) of the week is called shabbath. \nOn the other hand, <strong>שבע</strong> (<strong>sheva</strong>) is the number seven and is related to the word <strong>سبعة</strong> (<strong>sab’a</strong>) in Arabic. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Some extra information on the word shabbath:</strong> The seventh day of the week for Jews is Saturday as it is with Arabs, so <strong>shabbath</strong> means Saturday, and so does its Arabic counterpart <strong>السبت</strong> (<strong>sabt</strong>) (but for Muslim Arabs, the day of rest is <strong>جمعة</strong> (<strong>jum’a</strong>) which is the sixth day). The Persian word <strong>شنبه</strong> (<strong>shanbeh</strong>) has been derived from shabbath and has the same meaning (Saturday) but it is not the day of rest; it is the first day of the week. Instead of Saturday, the last day of the week for Iranians is Friday which is the Islamic holy day of the week. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That's all I know so I hope it helps. </p>\n", "Id":"3233", "ParentId":"3220", "CreationDate":"2013-02-19T21:33:38.320", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1768", "LastActivityDate":"2013-02-19T21:33:38.320", "CommentCount":"8"}
