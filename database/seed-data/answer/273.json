Especially in languages with writing, most speakers can be asked \"which sound did you make here?\" in a word, and provide an answer; the answer often roughly corresponds to some canonical choice of representative sound for that phoneme. I believe speakers of languages which use pictographic representations are often also able to do this; I'm not sure what the situation is like with speakers of languages without a widely accepted writing system.</p>\n\n<p>\"Phone,\" on the other hand, seems like it could be more contentious. For instance, in Uighur /o/ and /u/ are separate phonemes; if asked, speakers will readily clarify which one they used; but the actual acoustics of their articulations in context easily bleed into each other.</p>\n", "Id":"273", "ParentId":"212", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T18:21:48.753", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"84", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-18T18:21:48.753", "CommentCount":"2"}
