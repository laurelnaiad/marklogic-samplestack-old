I just conferred with my Japanese co-worker about your example.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that Japanese does not permit instrumental subjects.</p>\n\n<p>The English sentence \"The scissors cut the paper.\" can not be expressed as, \"*ハサミが紙を切る”　(hasami ga kami o kiru) grammatically.  Instead it must be spoken with a non-subject instrument \"ハサミで紙を切る” (hasami de kami o kiru) The difference is between が (ga) the subject marker and で (de) the instrument marker.  The subject is grammatically absent from the latter example, but if explicitly stated would be a person or other agent.</p>\n\n<p>I proposed to him the possibility of motorized scissors that automatically cut paper without human intervention and he found this grammatically acceptable as per the first example, but then the instrumentality comes into question.</p>\n", "Id":"2639", "ParentId":"1850", "CreationDate":"2012-10-02T06:23:02.050", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1370", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-02T06:23:02.050", "CommentCount":"3"}
