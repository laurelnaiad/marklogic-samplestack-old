He used this model to come up with a new alphabet, which he presented to the king when he returned to Armenia in 405 AD. The new alphabet was well-received and a new Armenian translation of the bible was published in 405 AD. Other literary works soon followed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are some differences between spoken and written language:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Two sounds, <code>[f]</code> and palatalized <code>[ja]</code> that have been adopted from Russian.</li>\n<li>Other subtle differences have primarily dialectic nature.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"4714", "ParentId":"4704", "CreationDate":"2013-10-12T15:11:12.537", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-12T15:11:12.537", "CommentCount":"1"}
