{"Body":"<p>You don't need to go around the world to find examples. In Portuguese and French, all plural personal pronouns end in \"s\".

Plus, they're formed as in English (they're all related languages, so it's no big deal). Interesting that when I saw your question I thought \"well, that's interesting\", until I tested if it worked in Portuguese: then the answer was obvious.</p>\n\n<p>As these answers have shown, this is far from uncommon, even appearing in English non-standard forms. I guess if you knew some other languages it would help, don't you think?</p>\n\n<p>I noticed no one directly answered your question, and although it is clear what all of us mean, I always like a direct answer: <strong>yes, there are such languages</strong>.</p>\n", "Id":"4159", "ParentId":"4145", "LastEditorUserId":"2334", "CreationDate":"2013-08-10T17:29:01.723", "OwnerUserId":"2334", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-08-10T18:41:20.080", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"28", "WebsiteUrl":"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usu%C3%A1rio:JMCF125", "Id":"2334", "AccountId":"2441446", "CreationDate":"2013-08-09T21:02:30.707", "AboutMe":"<p>Hello passers-by.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a Portuguese socialist idealist, and a hobbyist in diverse areas, such as Programming, Mathematics, Linguistics, Politics, Philosophy, etc. I can also be found with this very name as an editor of Wikipedia.</p>\n\n<p>The flag you see is from an SVG I wrote, and I use it instead of the Portuguese flag for two reasons: first, the <a href=\"https://www.google.pt/search?safe=off&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1301&amp;bih=656&amp;q=bandeira+de+portugal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Portuguese flag</a> is hard to write in SVG; the second reason is that I am not only Portuguese, but an Esperantist and a left-wing citizen of the world.
