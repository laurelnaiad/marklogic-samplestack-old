The paragon example of such a language was held to be Warlpiri (Pama-Nyungan, Australia), but it has now been shown to be analyzable in terms of familiar syntactic theories.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4047512\">This 1983 article</a> by Hale in NLLT is an example of a non-configurationality analysis of Warlpiri.  <a href=\"http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8152\">This 2002 MIT dissertation</a> by Legate** argues for an analysis of the language in line with standard syntactic theories, and by extension that \"non-configurational languages\" do not form a separate class.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*This is of course soemething of a simplification of the literature on non-configurationality.</p>\n\n<p>**Full disclosure: a professor of mine.</p>\n", "Id":"542", "ParentId":"538", "CreationDate":"2011-09-26T21:30:03.857", "Score":"9", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-26T21:30:03.857", "CommentCount":"2"}
