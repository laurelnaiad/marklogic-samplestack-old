The most reasonable plural of <em>koopa</em> is <em>koopas</em>, since most English nouns form their plurals by adding (orthographic) <em>-s</em>. If you want to take an affected air, you can call them <em>koopae</em>, by analogy with Latinate English words ending in <em>-a</em> which have a learned plural form with <em>-ae</em> (e.g., <em>alumna</em>, <em>alumnae</em>, which you might find in some brochures for women's colleges).</p>\n\n<p>You couldn't get <em>koopa</em> to have another type of irregular plural (and expect people to guess you are talking about more than one kooopa), unless the singular form has the right sound pattern that will let people pick up on your game. </p>\n", "Id":"3590", "ParentId":"3589", "comments":[], "CreationDate":"2013-04-19T00:57:39.157", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"483", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-19T00:57:39.157", "CommentCount":"5"}
