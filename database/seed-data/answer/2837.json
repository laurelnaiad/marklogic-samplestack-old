{"Body":"<p>Well Papua New Guinea famously has a lot of languages - 830 languages at the last count (and that's languages, not dialects!)\nHowever, I'm not sure about how different these languages are, but the numbers are huge and do come from a few different backgrounds. \nFor example, English and Hiri Motu are pretty different languages.</p>\n\n<p>If you take the land mass of PNG (452,860 km sq) and divide by the number of languages, according to ethnologue (830) you get a figure of approximately 546 km squared per language. The figure for Vanuatu would be approx. 107 km sp per language, indicating a higher density, but whether or not these languages vary as much as those of PNG, you'd have to consult the link given in jlovegren's answer.</p>\n", "Id":"2837", "ParentId":"2836", "LastEditorUserId":"783", "CreationDate":"2012-11-13T11:50:12.307", "OwnerUserId":"783", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-11-15T12:58:57.523", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://None", "Id":"783", "AccountId":"1263184", "CreationDate":"2012-02-20T12:40:45.587", "AboutMe":"<p>English Language graduate.</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"Wales", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"1036", "DisplayName":"Danger Fourpence", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T19:41:06.517"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-11-15T12:58:57.523", "Score":"12", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://None", "Id":"783", "AccountId":"1263184", "CreationDate":"2012-02-20T12:40:45.587", "AboutMe":"<p>English Language graduate.</p>\n", "Age":"24", "Location":"Wales", "DownVotes":"2", "Views":"16", "Reputation":"1036", "DisplayName":"Danger Fourpence", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T19:41:06.517"}}
