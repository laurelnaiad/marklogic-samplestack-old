{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I've never heard about distinction between personal and non-personal masculine/feminine as separate genders, however it's quite interesting to learn that people from outside can see it that way.</p>\n\n<p>The example from the Wikipedia is a bit doubtful, because it gives as an example the nouns with other endings, and those decline in other way. But taking as example words with the same ending:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>kot - a cat, widzę kota - I see a cat</li>\n<li>płot - a fence - widzę płot - I see a fence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, if we have a surname \"Płot\", there will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Widzę pana Płota - I see mr. Fence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, some nouns decline in the other way for animate and non-animate nouns. This is, however, not called in Polish grammar <em>gender</em>. </p>\n", "Id":"2088", "ParentId":"379", "CreationDate":"2012-06-12T11:51:25.170", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1064", "LastActivityDate":"2012-06-12T11:51:25.170", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"122", "WebsiteUrl":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/909378/stepan-vihor", "Id":"1064", "AccountId":"540989", "CreationDate":"2012-05-31T13:51:48.693", "AboutMe":"<p>A secret</p>\n", "Age":"29", "Location":"Ukraine/Poland", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"244", "DisplayName":"Stepan Vihor", "LastAccessDate":"2012-11-01T18:14:17.807"}}
