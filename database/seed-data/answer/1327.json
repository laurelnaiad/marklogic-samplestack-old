{"Body":"<p>The book accompanying the open-source Natural Language Toolkit, <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/book\"><em>Natural Language Processing with Python --- Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit</em></a>, is available as a <a href=\"https://isbndb.com/x/book/natural_language_processing_with_python/buy/isbn/amazon.html\">paper book</a> and free online, and is both a good introduction to computational linguistics and programing with the Python language.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1554\">Language Log review</a> of the book begins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This book is here to help you get your\n  job done.\" I love that line (from the\n  preface). It captures the spirit of the\n  book. Right from the start, readers/\n  users get to do advanced things with\n  large corpora, including information- rich visualizations and sophisticated\n  theory implementation. If you've\n  started to see that your research would\n  benefit from some computational\n  power, but you have limited (or no)\n  programming experience, don't despair â€” install NLTK and its data sets (it's a snap), then work through this book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"1327", "ParentId":"1320", "LastEditorUserId":"100", "CreationDate":"2012-01-23T23:09:54.053", "OwnerUserId":"702", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-27T15:50:57.270", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"84", "Location":"Israel", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"100", "AccountId":"78446", "Views":"6", "Reputation":"244", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T04:37:43.120", "DisplayName":"Daniel Hershcovich", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-16T20:01:10.310", "Age":"23"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-27T15:50:57.270", "Score":"11", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"702", "AccountId":"374134", "Views":"3", "Reputation":"228", "CreationDate":"2012-01-23T22:57:22.467", "DisplayName":"Hugo", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-07T15:13:05.960"}}
