{"Body":"<p>Your question is based on a wrong assumption - the letter w in bow2 is due to a spelling convention imposed by French scribes. At first, long u was respelt as ou (like in house), and then all word-final ou's were respelt as ow - I'm sure you've already noticed how rare or non-existent English words are that end in ou. Then long u was diphthongised - the Great Vowel Shift. This stuff is pretty basic, and you can read about it in any intro textbook on the history of English.</p>\n", "Id":"2551", "ParentId":"2524", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2012-09-11T14:03:21.593", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-11T18:56:50.750", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-11T18:56:50.750", "Score":"3", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
