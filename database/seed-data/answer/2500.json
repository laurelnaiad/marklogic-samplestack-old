{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Post-velar is not a term accepted by the International Phonetic Association. In some older papers (or from older professors) you might have to learn what they mean by it like kaleissin said. That's why the IPA developed the IPA. So no, it's not an established practice. Also, Americanist is outdated and only used by people that don't know how to type on computers, OK, no, just by stubborn professors. I would do what you can to set APA aside, but learn it in auxiliary to IPA if you must for a class.</p>\n", "Id":"2500", "ParentId":"2426", "CreationDate":"2012-09-01T04:19:07.443", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1298", "LastActivityDate":"2012-09-01T04:19:07.443", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "WebsiteUrl":"http://imagininglanguage.wordpress.com", "Id":"1298", "AccountId":"1139230", "CreationDate":"2012-09-01T04:07:18.940", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm in my last year of undergrad linguistics at Ohio State.</p>\n", "Age":"26", "Location":"Columbus, OH", "DownVotes":"0", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"121", "DisplayName":"Michael Billips", "LastAccessDate":"2012-09-01T04:38:16.170"}}
