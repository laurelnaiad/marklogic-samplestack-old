Suppose you’re convinced that 1) all languages are variations of an universal, hard-wired human capacity; 2) languages can only be acquired “for real” when you’re a child in the critical period; and 3) the one true goal of linguistic science is to understand Language (defined in these terms).  If so, then conlangs would be something like fake data.  Natlangs are seen as clues to Language, but conlangs could lead you to wrong conclusions.</p>\n", "Id":"2681", "ParentId":"2670", "CreationDate":"2012-10-11T16:20:29.617", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"200", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-11T16:20:29.617", "CommentCount":"1"}
