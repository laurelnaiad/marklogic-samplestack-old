My specific interests are in quantum computing, evolutionary game theory, modern evolutionary synthesis, and theoretical cognitive science. Previously I was at the Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Combinatorics &amp; Optimization at the University of Waterloo and a visitor to the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://egtheory.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theory, Evolution, and Games Group Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cstheory.blogoverflow.com/author/artemkaznatcheev/\">Theoretical Computer Science Blogoveflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/101780559173703781847/\" rel=\"nofollow\">G+ profile</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "Age":"25", "Location":"Montreal, Canada", "DownVotes":"18", "Views":"25", "Reputation":"876", "DisplayName":"Artem Kaznatcheev", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-11T00:59:33.567"}, "comments":[], "Body":"<p>Parents might do this instinctively to help children avoid <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/210/33\">pronoun reversal-errors</a> (among other potential benefits in language acquisition).</p>\n\n<p>I published a <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/9t456l7160427430/\">paper about this</a> where I considered a previous connectionist model of pronoun acquisition. The results lead to a hypothesis that using more third-person (like the nouns 'mommy' and 'daddy') can help reduce pronoun reversal-errors in children. Unfortunately we haven't had the time/resources to set up real baby experiments to verify this, yet.</p>\n", "Id":"550", "ParentId":"548", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T04:30:08.953", "Score":"14", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"33", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-27T04:30:08.953", "CommentCount":"4"}
