{"Body":"<p>The modern syntax approach to this, unlike the traditional grammar approach, is to categorize words according to morphological and syntactic properties. </p>\n\n<p>Morphologically, we can observe that nouns can be derived from other nouns using the suffix <em>-ism</em>, for example, to indicate a belief or process (<em>capital</em> > <em>capitalism</em>). Verbs are derived from other kinds of affixes, such as <em>-ify</em> (<em>terror</em> > <em>terrify</em>) and <em>un-</em> (<em>do</em> > <em>undo</em>). Besides, nouns can be inflected for number (<em>book</em> > <em>books</em>) and verbs can be inflected for tense, aspect and mood (<em>give</em> > <em>given</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Syntactically, a noun can be placed after a definite article (technically, a determiner), for example (<em>the book is green</em>), but not after an adverb like <em>more</em> (*<em>this one is more book than the other</em>). A verb can be followed by an adverb of manner, like <em>humbly</em> (<em>he speaks humbly</em>), but not by an article (*<em>a speaks is fine</em>). Likewise, if you can substitute a word with a regular noun or verb, both words will belong to the same category. </p>\n\n<p>The combination of morphological and syntactic analyses allows you to define what category a word belongs to. About the third item, you are referring to a specific use of the verb <em>to be</em>, known as copula, more specifically, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_copula\" rel=\"nofollow\">zero copula</a>, present in languages such as Russian and Hebrew.</p>\n", "Id":"765", "ParentId":"763", "LastEditorUserId":"22", "CreationDate":"2011-10-10T18:57:14.657", "OwnerUserId":"22", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-11T11:58:38.203", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"1855", "WebsiteUrl":"http://betareduction.wordpress.com", "Id":"22", "AccountId":"263496", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T20:54:04.197", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a software developer, who also happens to have a great many other interests in life.
