{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>There are several overlapping factors here:\nFirstly, many Indo-European languages share root words that go back long before Latin, and have been subject to a number of sound shifts, which is why they may not seem related at first (cf, the difference between the initial [sh] in 'short' and the [k] in 'Kurz' and 'curzu'). These are continually ongoing - for example, the ancestral German word probably ended in a '-t', but these were later shifted to a '-ts' sound.</p>\n\n<p>Then, layered into this is the adoption of words from Latin, which was so prestigious in the past, and similarly the adoption of words from French and Italian (especially into English, but also into German) for similar reasons in the later medieval centuries. This has given English doubled pairs like 'short' and 'curt', by 're-'adopting cognate forms, and finding a space for them in the vocabulary. I don't know German anywhere near well enough to be aware of a similar example.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is the tendency of some languages to maintain a separation from others. The reason that Italian uses 'pomodoro' instead of a cognate to 'Tomate' isn't because German and Italian are that different, it's just because the linguistic powers that be in Italy consciously avoided it. In a current context, many language communities prefer to create new technological words instead of using English terms.</p>\n", "Id":"4710", "ParentId":"2850", "CreationDate":"2013-10-12T07:24:17.523", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2582", "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-12T07:24:17.523", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"0", "DownVotes":"0", "Id":"2582", "AccountId":"3428289", "Views":"0", "Reputation":"29", "CreationDate":"2013-10-12T07:24:17.523", "DisplayName":"Malachite84", "LastAccessDate":"2013-10-12T07:24:17.523"}}
