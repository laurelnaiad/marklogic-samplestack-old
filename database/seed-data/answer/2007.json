The cultural elements embedded in the use of language are hard to acquire later in life.</p>\n\n<p>If you \"get\" both English and Portuguese jokes even after spending some time in another country, you might have two native languages. I have a friend in China who grew up speaking English to her American parents and Chinese to her nanny. She went to a local public school with some other American expats' children and now \"thinks\" in both languages.</p>\n\n<p>The example @Neil gives is tricky, but I'm afraid that people who studied English as a second language might have an easier time spotting the mistake because they took intense grammar lessons. I learned English as a second language in school, so I did immediately find the mistake and was also able to explain why the second sentence was wrong. If you see the mistake but don't know why, that probably means you are a native English speaker. (If you can explain, you might as well be a native speaker who knows these grammar rules.)</p>\n", "Id":"2007", "ParentId":"1994", "CreationDate":"2012-05-28T18:42:10.993", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"847", "LastActivityDate":"2012-05-28T18:42:10.993", "CommentCount":"4"}
