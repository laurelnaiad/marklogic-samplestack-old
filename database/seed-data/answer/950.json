And right now, while I'm typing, I'm thinking in English. But it obviously isn't my mother tongue. </p>\n\n<p>So let's define what a mother tongue is again, this is the mostly agreed definition: <em>it's the language you acquired in the early years of your life through the natural language acquisition in a natural setting</em> (with your family, your village/town/city) <em>and regardless of your following instruction</em>; for these reasons, it's usually also the first language that you acquire.</p>\n\n<p>Considering this definition, you can't change your mother tongue, it's something that doesn't depend on what you do but on your own personal history. However you can reach a high fluency in other languages and that is the key to think in those languages. For example, if you go to another country and live there, after a while you'll acquire the skills to be fluent and you'll treat that language almost as it was your mother tongue. Some people even dream in other languages, not just think in that, but they still have the same mother tongue.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I wasn't speaking about the situations Louis mentioned, such as turning off the lights, since that doesn't require any language skill, or about deaf people, which are on a different level and I don't have enough knowledge as for now in that field.</p>\n", "Id":"950", "ParentId":"949", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T09:09:30.213", "Score":"6", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"111", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-04T09:09:30.213", "CommentCount":"11"}
