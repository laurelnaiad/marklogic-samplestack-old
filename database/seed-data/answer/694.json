{"Body":"<p>I'm going to answer about just the words for \"pineapple\".  In short, you're seeing two phenomena:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>new item</strong> is introduced to the world, so a <strong>new name</strong> is needed to go with it.  Whichever name is used by the introducers gets adopted in many other languages.  See <em>coffee</em> or <em>computer</em> for some other examples of this.</li>\n<li>The dataset you have above only includes examples that show the author's intended pattern and <strong>excludes examples that don't fit</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's start by looking at the dataset.  Clearly there's a bias towards <em>ananas</em>-type words than towards <em>pineapple</em>-type words, but we don't know why.  One possibility is that the collector of this dataset simply included only languages with <em>ananas</em> and discarded any examples of <em>pineapple</em> (apart from English).</p>\n\n<p>So let's get some data of our own.  I'm using Google Translate to pull up words for pineapple in all the languages they provide.  (With a few restrictions: there must be a result other than what I typed in English, and there must be a romanization available.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Afrikaans: pynappel</li>\n<li>Armenian: ark’ayakhndzor</li>\n<li>Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finish, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Macedonian, Maltese, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian: ananas</li>\n<li>Basque, Galician, Spanish: piña</li>\n<li>Bengali: Ānārasa</li>\n<li>Catalan, Filipino: pinya</li>\n<li>Chinese: bōluó</li>\n<li>English: pineapple</li>\n<li>Estonian: ananass</li>\n<li>Georgian: ananasi</li>\n<li>Greek, Portuguese, Slovak: ananás</li>\n<li>Gujarati: Anēnāsa</li>\n<li>Haitian: anana</li>\n<li>Hindi: Anannāsa</li>\n<li>Hungarian: ananász</li>\n<li>Indonesian, Malay: nanas</li>\n<li>Irish: anann</li>\n<li>Japanese: Painappuru</li>\n<li>Kannada: Anānas haṇṇu</li>\n<li>Korean: pain-aepeul</li>\n<li>Latvian: ananāsu</li>\n<li>Lithuanian: ananasas</li>\n<li>Swahili: mananasi</li>\n<li>Tamil: Aṉṉāci</li>\n<li>Telugu: Anāsa paṇḍu</li>\n<li>Thai: S̄ạbpard</li>\n<li>Vietnamese: dứa</li>\n<li>Welsh: phîn-afal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At a glance, it looks like we have six basic types here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ananas: 42 languages</li>\n<li>piña/pineapple: 10 languages</li>\n<li>ark’ayakhndzor: 1 language</li>\n<li>bōluó: 1 language</li>\n<li>S̄ạbpard: 1 language</li>\n<li>dứa: 1 language</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clearly the <em>ananas</em> words are the most common, but what does that mean?  Should Serbian and Croatian (which are generally mutually intellible) each get a \"vote\" while Mexican Spanish and Castilian Spanish have to share a \"vote\"?  Which languages you count and which ones you don't is fairly arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>Let's break this up a different way.  The pineapple only came to the Old World via European colonization of the New World, so let's see what the European colonizers call this fruit.  Here we're only looking at languages whose parent countries had a major colonial presence in the New World before 1600:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Portuguese: ananás</li>\n<li>Spanish: piña</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One of these languages use a <em>pine</em>-type word, one uses an <em>ananas</em>-type word.  Doing a bit of reading, it seems that <em>ananas</em> is the Guaraní word for \"pineapple\" and was borrowed by the Portuguese, and it spread from there.  The Spanish (going all the way back to Columbus) called the fruit <em>piña</em> \"pine\" because of its resemblance to a pinecone.</p>\n\n<p>From these two origins come many of the names for \"pineapple\" in the various languages of the world.  The only phenomenon you're seeing here is that <em>ananas</em> simply became more popular.  My best guess as to the distribution of the two forms would be the dominance of French (with <em>ananas</em>) in previous centuries.  Languages that are more heavily influenced by Spanish (like Filipino) end up with <em>pine</em>-type words.  Languages more heavily influenced by English (like Japanese) end up with the full <em>pineapple</em> type.</p>\n", "Id":"694", "ParentId":"690", "LastEditorUserId":"314", "CreationDate":"2011-10-04T16:49:15.010", "OwnerUserId":"314", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-10-05T04:58:20.613", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"133", "WebsiteUrl":"http://lumenaris.com", "Id":"314", "AccountId":"906180", "CreationDate":"2011-09-27T02:55:28.507", "AboutMe":"<p>I play lots of games, develop a few.
