{"Body":"<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Lojban\">lojban</a>, a conlang, already meets these goals.</li>\n<li>They already have <a href=\"http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Dictionaries%2C+Glossers+and+parsers\">a few parsers</a>. <a href=\"http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Official+Parser\">One of them</a> even has a YACC grammar.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have come across literature that give the impression that it is possible to make a parser for Sanskrit, that would generate unambiguous parses. But I don't know of well-executed Sanskrit parsers, myself.</p>\n\n<p>A few additional thoughts on the matter: Morphology is one of the biggest reasons why parsers make mistakes. Chinese does not have morphology at all. Chinese parsers perform well. However, at the moment, English parsers are the most accurate of all. This is possibly because parsers for English have received far more attention than parsers for any other language.</p>\n", "Id":"1701", "ParentId":"1697", "LastEditorUserId":"126", "CreationDate":"2012-03-25T13:26:56.783", "OwnerUserId":"126", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-03-25T14:02:19.157", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-03-25T14:02:19.157", "Score":"8", "CommentCount":"22", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
