In contrast, \"part of speech\" is the <em>intuitive</em> class of a word. I suppose the equivalent term for syntactic category in HPSG would be <em>Typed Feature Structures</em> or just <em>signs</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In CCG, for example, the syntactic category <code>S\\NP</code> refers to many things: intransitive verb, transitive verb with the object filled-in, a <em>modified</em> verb phrase, etc.  </p>\n\n<p>As another example, given the phrases \"young Obama\" and \"Barack Obama\", a (trained) person may tag \"young\" as adjective and \"Barack\" as noun. However, in CCG, they are both <code>N/N</code>.</p>\n", "Id":"4027", "ParentId":"4026", "CreationDate":"2013-07-19T08:01:48.283", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-19T08:01:48.283", "CommentCount":"2"}
