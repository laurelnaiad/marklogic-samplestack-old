{"Body":"<p>Phonetics deals with <em>sounds</em>. Phonology deals with <em>phonemes</em>. What is a phoneme? Ah, that's one of the things phonology deals with. <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nikolai_Trubetzkoy\">Nikolai Trubetskoy</a> defined it as “the smallest distinctive unit within the structure of a given language”. Now, what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>For example in English if someone says <code>[riŋ]</code>, you will understand <em>ring</em>, even if <em>you</em> pronounce it <code>[ɹiŋ]</code>. So we can consider that the differences between <code>[r]</code> and <code>[ɹ]</code> are not distinctive. Thus, we call <code>[r]</code> and <code>[ɹ]</code> unbound variants of a phoneme <code>/r/</code>.<br>\nNow if someone says <code>[piŋ]</code> it has a different meaning : it's <em>ping</em>. So <code>[p]</code> is not a realisation of <code>/r/</code>, but rather of another phoneme <code>/p/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This process is the most obvious way of finding the phonemes of an arbitrary language, and <code>[riŋ]</code> and <code>[piŋ]</code> what we call a minimal pair. A pair of words different only for one sound, but with distinct meanings.</p>\n\n<p>As you have probably guessed it's a bit more complicated, but that's the bulk of it.</p>\n\n<p>Now why bother with phonemes? Why aren't sounds relevant enough?</p>\n\n<p>It is a matter of abstraction, convenience. Though interesting, phonetic systems of languages often lack obvious patterns. Studying them is tedious, and subject to bias. And there are many topics in linguistics that don't demand such precision.</p>\n\n<p>Phonological systems, though present many regularities, are far easier to formalise, and in fields such as morphology, semantics or pragmatics, they are just precise enough. There is no need to know if one says <em>ring</em> <code>[riŋ]</code> or <code>[ɹiŋ]</code> if they bear the same meaning.</p>\n\n<p>So there are differences, these two fields don't address the same issues, though they are closely related. And both are useful.</p>\n", "Id":"187", "ParentId":"180", "LastEditorUserId":"39", "CreationDate":"2011-09-15T23:33:36.847", "OwnerUserId":"39", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-09-16T07:56:24.040", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"73", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Orleans, France", "Id":"39", "DownVotes":"1", "AccountId":"396926", "Views":"12", "Reputation":"425", "CreationDate":"2011-09-13T21:03:08.370", "DisplayName":"Evpok", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-08T22:22:04.843", "AboutMe":"<p>Fourth year student in Mathematics and Linguistics, particularly in statistical NLP.
