A striking present-day example of compounding occurs in English dialects that have the <em>pin/pen</em> merger, in which the compound \"ink pen\" has been coined to compensate for the ambiguity. This sort of thing happens frequently in all sorts of languages.</p>\n\n<p>But also don't forget that phonological loss is often compensated by other phonological processes, as well. There is epenthesis and straight-up insertion. There is compensatory lengthening (as Cerberus mentioned), as well as nasalization, vowel harmony, and other phonological processes that can preserve featural information and distinctiveness even if segments are lost. It's not the case that phonological change is always destructive!</p>\n", "Id":"59", "ParentId":"55", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T02:21:36.417", "Score":"13", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"91", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T02:21:36.417", "CommentCount":"1"}
