{"Body":"<p>I have never seen a serious linguist claiming that Armenian didn't belong to the IE family (it is a satem language). Where did you read that?</p>\n\n<p>I strongly recommend chapter 16, Armenian, in <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405188960.html\">Fortson 2010 textbook</a>, esp. parts \"The Introduction\" and \"From PIE to Classical Armenian\", pp. 382-393. It's a good idea to read it thoroughly!</p>\n\n<p>Also, have a look at <a href=\"http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/content/armenian/2-2-aspects.html\">http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/content/armenian/2-2-aspects.html</a> (it's a chapter from an excellent etymological dictionary of Armenian lexicon inherited from the IE)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some of the claims you made are in fact incorrect</strong> (e.g. <strong>words for relatives</strong>; also see Basic Words from Wikipedia, posted by Daniel Briggs):</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>mayr</em> ‘mother’</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>hayr</em> ‘father’</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>khoyr</em> ‘sister’</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>eġbayr</em> 'brother'</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>dowstr</em> 'daughter'</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>taygr</em> 'brother-in-law' (cf. Sanskrit devar-)</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>nu</em> 'daughter-in-law' (cf. Greek nuos, Old Church Slavonic snuxa)</p>\n\n<p>some other common examples are:</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>kov</em> ‘cow’</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>tun</em> ‘house’</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>em</em> ‘I am’</p>\n\n<p>Also, <strong>it's a good idea to compare Armenian with Greek</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>get</em> 'water' - Greek <em>hydor</em></p>\n\n<p>Arm. <em>ayr</em> 'man'- Greek <em>aner</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Re: numerals, your assumption is also wrong</strong>; here's a quote from Matasovic 2009 (Winter 1992 is of the same opinion):</p>\n\n<p>\"Here are the numerals from 1 to 10: mi, erku, erekc, čcorkc, hing, vecc, ewtcn, utc, inn, tasn. <em>Although this is not obvious at first sight, their forms are inherited from PIE</em> (*smi-yo-, *dwoh1, *treyes, *kwetwores, *penkwe, *(k's)wek's, *septm, *h3ek'toh1, *newn, *dek'm).\"</p>\n", "Id":"1241", "ParentId":"1235", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2012-01-08T19:14:18.517", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-01-12T22:24:20.163", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-01-12T22:24:20.163", "Score":"11", "CommentCount":"6", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
