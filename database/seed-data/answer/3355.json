{"Body":"<p>Could your results be biased by English? There could be languages with lower or zero frequency of personal pronouns due to one or all of the reasons below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Personal pronouns are hidden within verb paradigms. E.g. in Spanish one would hardly say <em>yo tengo</em> (I have) but rather just <em>tengo</em> instead, since the meaning of 1st.p.sg. is conveyed by verb ending.</p></li>\n<li><p>Personal pronouns are subject to change. Consider Japanese, Chinese or Basque, where all or some of the personal pronouns vary according to speaker's/addressee's age, gender, social status, etc. Personal pronouns may even be tabooed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Personal pronouns fit a different paradigm. Consider languages with pronouns changing by tense (Kpelle) or with other categories (e.g. inclusive/exclusive dichotomies known for many languages).</p></li>\n<li><p>There are no personal pronouns (although no such a language has been attested for), or they are within a really minimalistic paradigm (e.g. Lardil has only two personal pronouns).</p></li>\n<li><p>The context/corpus covers a limited scope (e.g. there is a sacred language, an illiterate community, bilingual/multilingual community with social stratification by  languages, or, to put it simply, the corpus covers a limited scope of all the social registers of a language).</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "Id":"3355", "ParentId":"3351", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2013-03-11T19:25:14.583", "OwnerUserId":"1686", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-04-10T21:39:45.557", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
