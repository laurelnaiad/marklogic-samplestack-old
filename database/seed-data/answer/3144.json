{"Body":"<p>@Alenanno's answer is great, but there is yet another factor: <strong>conspiracy</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for a controversial example; <strong>please consider it from linguistic point only.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Say, your Thai girlfriend is talking with her friend, and they are discussing you. There's a big dialect of Thai, called Isaan, by the name of a large province. If they both are fluent with Isaan, they will almost certainly switch to Isaan. This is regardless if they speak something bad about you. This is rather a question of <strong>comfort</strong>, and Thai people feel much better if they are sure nobody else understands them.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/2812/argot-vs-jargon\">Argot</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>As per <strong>suitability</strong>, this example is very relevant:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", when Pierre Bezukhov was asked (in Russian), <em>\"what is freemasonry?\"</em>, he started answering, <em>\"c'est un fraternite..\"</em> and then realized he was unable to discuss abstract terms in Russian of those days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't say <em>modern</em> languages are bad for any topics, but certainly, <em>comfort</em> and  <em>economize your speech</em> are important criteria.</p>\n", "Id":"3144", "ParentId":"3141", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-01-29T17:56:41.600", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-01-29T18:31:29.663", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-29T18:31:29.663", "Score":"1", "CommentCount":"1", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
