It contains sentence-aligned bi-texts, including German-English and Slovene-English. However, it doesn't come close to the quantities of text you are asking for (German ~ 47 million words, Slovenian close to 13 million words). (Also see the <a href=\"http://ipsc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php?id=197\" rel=\"nofollow\">EU translation memory</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I doubt huge corpora exist for Slovenian at all, especially if you need parallel corpora.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some more resources for locating corpora:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://opus.lingfil.uu.se\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opus.lingfil.uu.se</a> (includes Slovenian corpora)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lt-world.org/kb/resources-and-tools/language-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lt-world.org/kb/resources-and-tools/language-data</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regarding English loanwords, it's important to realize loanwords are an integral part of language. Especially in domains like technology English loans are unavoidable. That said, different kinds of texts will likely contain different proportions of loanwords (and code switching), but I think this is something you will have to establish by analysing the available material.</p>\n", "Id":"3122", "ParentId":"3118", "CreationDate":"2013-01-26T16:18:50.797", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"444", "LastActivityDate":"2013-01-26T16:18:50.797", "CommentCount":"1"}
