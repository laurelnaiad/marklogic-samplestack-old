{"Body":"<p>I'll add my own (provisional) answer, that is: there is no tool or obvious workflow available supporting both interlinearization and sentence alignment. Sentence-aligned <em>analyzed</em> corpora appear to be created only from already analyzed inputs.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up using Toolbox, because it allows adding custom lines next to the text to be interlinearized. (Language Explorer is better in many ways, but it's impossible to add such custom lines). I added lines for the corresponding text in other languages, and manually pasted these in. This at least allows working on the analysis/interlinearization with the translation in sight.</p>\n\n<p>I am still open to better suggestions, of course.</p>\n", "Id":"2397", "ParentId":"1285", "LastEditorUserId":"444", "CreationDate":"2012-08-08T13:27:13.060", "OwnerUserId":"444", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-08-08T13:33:59.060", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"127", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Netherlands", "Id":"444", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"902812", "Views":"19", "Reputation":"934", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:14:27.380", "DisplayName":"arjan", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T14:07:55.473", "AboutMe":""}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-08T13:33:59.060", "Score":"0", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"127", "WebsiteUrl":"", "Location":"Netherlands", "Id":"444", "DownVotes":"2", "AccountId":"902812", "Views":"19", "Reputation":"934", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:14:27.380", "DisplayName":"arjan", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-14T14:07:55.473", "AboutMe":""}}
