The verbalizing suffix  \"-ize\" is originally Greek (and entered the language via Latin (borrowing) and French (descent from Latin)).  And \"-ify\" is originally Latin.  Both these are unambiguously productive (as is \"-ation\").  More recently and colloquially, English speakers have borrowed \"uber-\" as a prefix (from German).  Attached to an adjective (\"uber-tired,\" \"uber-happy\") it carries roughly the meaning of \"very.\"  On nouns (\"uber-linguist\") it means something like \"very exemplary.\"</p>\n\n<p>For a non-English example, the Basque past participle suffix \"-tu\" (the only pp. suffix which is productive today) is widely (though not universally, as I understand) held to be derived from Latin \"-tum,\" the neuter past participle suffix.</p>\n\n<p>These are just examples from two languages I happen to know something about.  So I'd say that this happens all the time, both as a colloquialism or \"joke\" and also as a part of core linguistic meaning.</p>\n", "Id":"266", "ParentId":"264", "CreationDate":"2011-09-18T06:44:38.477", "Score":"10", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"46", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-18T06:44:38.477", "CommentCount":"5"}
