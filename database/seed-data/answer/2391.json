{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>First off, one should keep in mind IPA symbols have no connection to one's native language. For example, <code>i</code> in transcription has nothing to do with <code>i</code> in <code>with</code>. Fortunately, their appearance often suggests the closest sound. For example, <code>ɘ</code> and <code>ɜ</code> resemble a certain similarity to <code>e</code>, but it's not a rule.</p>\n\n<p>So the best suggestion is to think they are <em>pictograms</em> that should be studied individually.</p>\n\n<p>If one prefers more scientific approach, there are three basic characteristics of a vowel:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Height (openness): how far the tongue is from the roof of the mouth</li>\n<li>Front/back: \"horizontal\" tongue position in the mouth</li>\n<li>Roundness: amount of rounding the lips</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>They form a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aIPA_vowel_chart_2005.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">well-known trapezoid</a>, and it may be a good exercise to try reproducing them with gradual transitions along each axis.</p>\n\n<p>There are more characteristics like length, nasalization, pitch, etc. They are represented with special symbols.</p>\n", "Id":"2391", "ParentId":"2376", "CreationDate":"2012-08-07T17:36:24.713", "Score":"1", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "LastActivityDate":"2012-08-07T17:36:24.713", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
