{"Body":"<p>There may be several aspects of what you're asking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In languages with gender-related inflections (e.g., all Slavic languages), words may conjugate not according to a speaker's gender;</li>\n<li>In languages with polite particles and honorific pronouns (e.g., Thai), the speaker may use those not according to their social/gender status (comparing to listener's);</li>\n<li>In languages with distinction between \"high\" and \"street\" language. For example, Thai has different words for \"to eat\": ทาน <code>[tʰaːn]</code>, formal versus กิน [kin], informal;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All cases occur when the speaker uses direct speech.</p>\n\n<p>Let's see what happens in each case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inflections</strong><br>\nAs far as I know, all Slavic languages retain gender-related inflections according to the <strong>original subject</strong>, as in Russian:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Direct speech: <em>она сказал<b>а</b>: \"я пошл<b>а</b> за пивом\"</em><br>\n(\"she said [past, fem.]: <strong>I</strong> went [past, fem.] for beer\")</li>\n<li>Indirect speech: <em>она сказал<b>а</b>, что она пошл<b>а</b> за пивом\"</em><br>\n(\"she said [past, fem.] that <strong>she</strong> went [past, fem.] for beer\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Polite particles</strong><br>\nThais often prefer shorter sentences, and the direct speech is grammatically simpler as it omits \"that\". However, when re-telling someone's words may lead to misunderstanding of  polite particles of a social class (that the final speaker doesn't belong to). Two examples below are spoken by a make speaker re-telling female's words:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Direct: เธอ พูด <em>ว่า</em> สวัสดี <em>คะ</em> (<em>she said, \"hello [polite particle, fem.]\"</em>)<br>\nnote here there's no masculine polite particle, so Thais often use the second way to say the same</li>\n<li>Direct: เธอ พูด <em>ครับ</em> ว่า สวัสดี <em>คะ</em> (<em>she said [polite particle, masc.], \"hello [polite particle, fem.]\"</em>)  </li>\n<li>Indirect: เธอ พูด สวัสดี <em>ครับ</em>  (<em>she said hello [polite particle, masc.]</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Low language by high-level speakers</strong><br>\nUsually it is prohibited to use such words for speakers of a high social class, so they use indirect speech to indicate (but not reproduce) vulgar words.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are even examples in English. Imagine a situation when two people with high social status (and hence using \"high\" language among themselves) discuss someone else's rude behavior:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Can you imagine that? <strong>He said to me, \"f%ck off\"</strong> on an important meeting, so I never work with them anymore.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Using an indirect speech, the whole picture is different:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Can you imagine that? <strong>He was so rude to me</strong> on an important meeting, so I never work with them anymore.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "Id":"4560", "ParentId":"1730", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2013-09-26T14:54:49.607", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-10-01T18:59:57.283", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-10-01T18:59:57.283", "Score":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
