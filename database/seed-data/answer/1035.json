{"Body":"<p>Where do I start? At first, there are literally tons of research on this topic (some call them parts of speech, others call them word classes). I don't know how much time you're willing to spend on reading or how linguistically well-trained you are.</p>\n\n<p>To be on the safe side, I strongly recommend to start with an excellent review article by Walter Bisang, Word Classes, In <em>The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology</em>, ed. J. J. Sung, pp. 280-302. Oxford: OUP, 2010. If you can't find the book, the draft version (without tables) is available <a href=\"http://www.linguistik.uni-mainz.de/bisang/wp-content/downloads/down2.pdf\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>Main points summarized here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The inadequacy of purely semantic/notional definitions.</li>\n<li>Four prerequisites for distinguishing word classes (you need all four of them):</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>- semantic criteria:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sasse 1993: nouns are thing-like concepts, verbs are event-like concepts;</p>\n\n<p>Langacker 1987: nouns are static and holistic, verbs are dynamic;</p>\n\n<p>Givon 1979: nouns represent ontological categories that are stable in time, unlike verbs (very time-unstable).</p>\n\n<p>Wierzbicka 2000, Dixon 2004: there are certain semantic types that are always associated with nouns or verbs only, e.g. PEOPLE, PARTS, FLORA etc. are always nouns, whereas MOTION, SPEAKING are always verbs.</p>\n\n<p>Croft 2000: nouns refer to objects, verbs express predication of an action etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- pragmatic criteria/criteria of discourse functions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nouns introduce participants, verbs assert the occurrence of an event.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- formal criteria:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nouns and verbs have different morphological and syntactic distribution. They may also differ in their phonological form.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- distinction between lexical and syntactic levels of analysis:</strong></p>\n\n<p>lexical (paradigmatic) vs. syntactic (syntagmatic) levels.</p>\n\n<p>He also talks about approaches to word classes proposed by Schachter 1985, Hengeveld 1992, Croft (in a series of works). There is a special section devoted to the noun/verb distinction (section 5). There is a nice conclusion there, where he cites three criteria (from <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/lity.2005.9.3.351\">Evans and Osada 2005</a>) which a language lacking a noun/verb distinction must meet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>compositionality;</li>\n<li>bidirectionality;</li>\n<li>exhaustiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n", "Id":"1035", "ParentId":"763", "LastEditorUserId":"445", "CreationDate":"2011-11-16T23:15:52.717", "OwnerUserId":"445", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2011-11-21T18:44:46.273", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}, "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-21T18:44:46.273", "Score":"7", "CommentCount":"2", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"197", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/z3GF5.jpg", "Id":"445", "AccountId":"992814", "CreationDate":"2011-10-23T14:24:40.117", "AboutMe":"<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> syntax, linguistic morphology, typology, historical linguistics, lexicography, lexicology, psycholinguistics, language acquisition, British accents</p>\n", "Location":"Seattle, WA", "DownVotes":"41", "Views":"56", "Reputation":"4171", "DisplayName":"Alex B.", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:35:04.640"}}
