{"Body":"<p>I presume you have the recursion of syntactic dependencies in mind. Yes, I agree: a language can never be finite as long as you can produce it. Even saying the exact same thing twice or thrice or a hundred times can at least theoretically add or change meaning.</p>\n\n<p>What those people you are probably thinking of mean is that you cannot have an infinite number of different <em>sentences</em> without some kind of sub-sentence recursion. That is to some extent true, but it seems to focus a bit too much on the sentence as a unit. Because I can say more or less the same thing... In shorter or different units. Another thing to consider is the following. Sentence boundaries are often a stylistic matter more tied to the following. Writing, rather than speech. They also are the following. Defined or chosen in somewhat arbitrary ways.</p>\n", "Id":"3676", "ParentId":"3673", "LastEditorUserId":"82", "CreationDate":"2013-05-09T05:12:00.087", "OwnerUserId":"82", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-05-09T07:13:35.790", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}, "LastActivityDate":"2013-05-09T07:13:35.790", "Score":"3", "CommentCount":"8", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
