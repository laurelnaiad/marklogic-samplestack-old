{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>It depends on the language, and how you choose to analyze it.</p>\n\n<p>In the phonetic sense, an affricate is a consonant cluster consisting of a stop that is released directly into a fricative, with no intervening release burst before the start of the fricative. Affricates may or may not be phonemic; that depends on whether the affricate behaves phonologically/phonotactically as an indivisible unit.</p>\n\n<p>An example is the cluster [tˢs]. In Japanese, it patterns as a phonemic unit; in fact, it alternates with (compare [matsu] <em>waits</em> with [mata] <em>waited</em>), and is often considered an allophone of, the single phoneme /t/. In contrast, in English, [tˢs] is a sequence of 2 phonemes rather than a phoneme, because it patterns like the sequence /t/ + /s/ (in words like <em>cats</em> /kæts/ the /t/ and /s/ belong to different morphemes, so /ts/ is clearly not a unitary phoneme).</p>\n\n<p>Another case is [tɕ] in Russian. This is clearly a phonemic affricate: because Russian doesn't even have a phoneme /ɕ/, it's not even possible to analyze it as a sequence.</p>\n\n<p>Whether to consider a (phonetic) affricate as two separate consonants in the onset depends on whether you are considering it as a non-phonemic sequence. Phonotactic considerations can also guide you here.</p>\n\n<p>Example: /tʃ/ in Spanish. There are 2 arguments that this should be considered a single consonant in the onset:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Standard Spanish has no phoneme /ʃ/, so it's not possible to analyze as /t/ + /ʃ/.</li>\n<li>If we exclude /tʃ/, Spanish phonotactics only permits a single obstruent in the onset. This is evidence against /tʃ/ being a sequence, because otherwise it would complicate the phonotactics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In your particular example, treating it as /CCV/ is more likely, since it's uncommon for languages to permit 3 obstruents in the onset, but /CCCV/ is also possible.</p>\n", "Id":"2718", "ParentId":"2714", "CreationDate":"2012-10-20T05:18:41.480", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"1021", "LastActivityDate":"2012-10-20T05:18:41.480", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"176", "WebsiteUrl":"https://launchpad.net/~replicator-snail", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/KPUcH.png", "Id":"1021", "AccountId":"124682", "CreationDate":"2012-05-18T02:34:01.443", "AboutMe":"<p>.
