{"Body":"<p>The proper term for what you're asking is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_distance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linguistic distance</a>. Also, there is an article on Wikipedia called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mutual intelligibility</a>, and it has a nice list of mutually intelligible languages.</p>\n\n<p>As noticed, there are several aspects by which linguistic distances (LD) between a certain pair of languages may differ. It may be orthography, morphology/lexicon, or phonetics.</p>\n\n<p>The most intriguing fact is that <strong>linguistic distances can be measured</strong>.<br>\nProf. <a href=\"http://ukrainianweek.com/Culture/65223\" rel=\"nofollow\">K.&nbsp;Tyshchenko</a> has published his method of computing LD. I would specifically recommend his work, <em>Metatheory of Linguistics (Kyiv, 1999)</em> (Ukrainian, Russian), but I'm terribly sorry for being unable to find this work in English.</p>\n\n<p>This is how the main diagram looks like:<br>\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HwyPg.jpg\" alt=\"Linguistic Distances\">\n(image taken from <a href=\"http://elms.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Also, the <a href=\"http://www.bowfree.com/data/_Frequency%20dictionaries/lex-distances.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ukrainian version</a> of the same diagram contains actual numbers of linguistic distances between the same set of languages.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And would this beg the question of whether they really are separate \"languages\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An obvious answer is, there's a certain threshold in measured LD above which they can be called different languages, while below which they may be considered dialects. Also, it should be understood that considering a separate language may involve a political aspect, so the political desires may not completely correspond the linguistic reality.</p>\n", "Id":"3007", "ParentId":"3006", "LastEditorUserId":"1009", "CreationDate":"2012-12-26T18:11:29.233", "OwnerUserId":"1009", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-12-27T09:31:06.180", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}, "LastActivityDate":"2012-12-27T09:31:06.180", "Score":"10", "CommentCount":"5", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"512", "WebsiteUrl":"http://weew-waaw.com", "Id":"1009", "AccountId":"947951", "CreationDate":"2012-05-15T02:50:16.013", "AboutMe":"<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/VxMqM.jpg\" alt=\"Weew-Waaw, Thai to English, Thai to Russian transcription\"><br>\nI'm working on a project of rule-based Thai transcription: (the link is temporarily unavailable)<br>\nTechnically, it is written in F# with a C# front-end.<br>\nI would be happy to get acquainted with those who are experienced with NLP (Natural Language Processing), just ping me in the SE chat. :-)</p>\n", "Age":"42", "Location":"Bangkok, Thailand", "DownVotes":"50", "Views":"36", "Reputation":"1656", "DisplayName":"bytebuster", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-19T00:53:20.473"}}
