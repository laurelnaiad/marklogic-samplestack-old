Latin is the first that comes to mind but if you already knew it. Learning it on purpose for Italian is not really convenient, you'd be better off using that time to learn Italian directly. If you had knowledge of Spanish and French, that'd be certainly a good help.</p>\n\n<p>Spanish is very similar to Italian (a stereotype says that you just need to add an S to Italian words to get Spanish, which is of course wrong but gives you an idea of their closeness). Many words are basically the same (the words for yes and no are the same except the graphic stress which is the opposite: <strong>sì/sí</strong>, <strong>no/no</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>French differs a bit in terms of some grammatical structures and vocabulary but it's close to Italian as well. If you had prior knowledge of these three languages, then you'd be at an advantage in learning Italian, but if you don't know them, just go ahead and learn Italian directly: if you choose to learn those later you'd have Italian as a prior knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning Esperanto: I agree with the others saying that I doubt it'd really help you. I haven't never studied it but I have seen some material written and I can say it didn't feel really \"italian\" to me and I'm a native italian speaker. If you don't have to learn it for personal interest or other needs, feel free to skip it and go straight to Italian. :)</p>\n", "Id":"3522", "ParentId":"3520", "CreationDate":"2013-04-12T08:46:40.973", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"111", "LastActivityDate":"2013-04-12T08:46:40.973", "CommentCount":"4"}
