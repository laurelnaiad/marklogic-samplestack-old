{"Body":"<p><strong>Deictic</strong> pronouns refer to entities that must be identified according to the context of utterance. For instance, in the sentence <code>I will give you an answer about deictic pronouns</code>, the deictic pronouns <code>I</code> and <code>you</code> refer to the speaker and the addressee, respectively. Of course, there could be different referents in each context of utterance. <strong>Anaphoric</strong> pronouns are different. They refer back to constituents in the sentence domain. That is the case of <code>her</code> in <code>Mary is my wife and I love her</code>. In principle, pronouns cannot be both anaphoric and deictic, since they simply pick up different referents.</p>\n", "Id":"3281", "ParentId":"3275", "LastEditorUserId":"1754", "CreationDate":"2013-02-25T21:31:59.980", "OwnerUserId":"1754", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2013-02-25T21:40:18.723", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"6", "WebsiteUrl":"", "ProfileImageUrl":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/q8I3U.jpg", "Id":"1754", "AccountId":"2338821", "CreationDate":"2013-02-12T08:06:32.000", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a linguistics student interested in semantics.
