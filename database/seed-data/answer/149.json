To me, these look like proto-conjugations. In particular, they have already begun to develop irregularities: \"give it to him\" should logically be <em>dálelo</em>, but some sort of euphonic change (not sure what this is called) has changed the middle consonant to <em>s</em>, creating the modern Spanish <em>dáselo</em>. With a few more such changes, this simple agglutination may someday become become a \"morphological category\" as impenetrable as the Latin noun.</p>\n", "Id":"149", "ParentId":"127", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T23:13:17.813", "Score":"14", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"58", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-14T23:13:17.813", "CommentCount":"10"}
