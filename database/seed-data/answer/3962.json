{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>I know practically nothing about Hebrew. My answer is based on your claim, \"a lot of the things virtually not present in at least two millennia have been given words that were literally <em>invented</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>There are two classes of words, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_class_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">open class</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_class\" rel=\"nofollow\">closed class</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open classes accept the addition of new morphemes (words), through such processes as compounding, derivation, inflection, coining, and borrowing. A closed class is a word class to which no new items can normally be added, and that usually contains a relatively small number of items. Typical closed classes found in many languages are adpositions (prepositions and postpositions), determiners, conjunctions, and pronouns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This applies to any language. People can create new nouns and verbs, when necessary or when convenient. For example, recent additions, to English, of verb forms of google and tweet, do not make English any less natural for it. Now, if some committee modifies Hebrew <em>grammar</em> significantly, I'd say there is good reason to start classifying the modified Hebrew as a <strong>constructed language</strong>, as opposed to <strong>natural language</strong>.</p>\n", "Id":"3962", "ParentId":"3953", "CreationDate":"2013-07-04T06:40:59.347", "Score":"3", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"126", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-04T06:40:59.347", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"94", "DownVotes":"21", "Id":"126", "AccountId":"154977", "Views":"23", "Reputation":"1354", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T15:07:55.557", "DisplayName":"prash", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T18:45:53.780"}}
