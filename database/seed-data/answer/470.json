I read the book some time ago, but I believe that the tribe has a gender for animate objects. If so, then articles or tense or case would have to match the animate category, lest the usage be ungrammatical.</p>\n\n<p>I think that what you call <em>grammatical gender</em> is simply called <em>gender.</em> They are really linguistic categories that are, as you say, somewhat arbitrary. Further, while many languages have two or three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), there are languages that have many genders. In Chinese, for example, there is no masculine or feminine gender, so <em>ta(1)</em> can mean \"he\" or \"she.\" However, there seems to be a separate gender for people <em>san ge ren</em> = three (people article) people. And another gender for money. <em>san(2) quai(4) chen(3)</em> = three (money article) dollars. These categories are very deep and not at all obvious to a non-native speaker such as myself. (Incidentally, I would welcome someone who knows or has studied Chinese to correct and extend my examples.)</p>\n", "Id":"470", "ParentId":"451", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T19:41:22.357", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"225", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-23T19:41:22.357", "CommentCount":"5"}
