{"Body":"<p>Nothing much. The distinction is a more or less artificial one. </p>\n\n<p>Supposedly, pragmatics is any part of what we laughingly call the \"meaning\" of an utterance that can be figured out by the listener. </p>\n\n<p>This includes </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/Presuppositiontriggers.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">presupposition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/Predicatetypes.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">factivity and entailment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/Grice.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grice's Maxims and conversational implicatures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/Deixis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">deixis</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and other topics, like speech acts, irony, and politeness. Everything else is semantics. Or so it goes.</p>\n\n<p>Well, this is not helpful, since you constantly have to be trying to scry out the mental calculations of various speakers in various situations to tell whether you're studying semantics or pragmatics. This is especially troublesome when semantics gets mixed up with logic -- which is rather like confusing speech with writing, since <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/logicguide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">logic</a> is just a written representation for natural semantics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://linguistics.uchicago.edu/people/McCawley-Lg.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim McCawley</a> put it this way, when he was describing <a href=\"http://linguistics.uchicago.edu/people/mccawleyinhiswords.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">his research areas</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Semantics/logic/pragmatics</strong> (it's impossible to talk in any detail about any of these three fields without getting into the other two, so I don't even try to keep them separate). I teach courses on logic from a linguist's point of view, taking a broad view of the subject matter of logic (logic has suffered from 23 centuries of myopia, which I try to make up for) and giving full weight to linguistic considerations in revising (or replacing) existing systems of logic to maximize their contact with natural language syntax and linguistic semantics. (See my book, <em>Everything that Linguists Have Always Wanted to Know About Logic (but were Ashamed to Ask</em>), University of Chicago Press, 2nd edition, 1993). I also from time to time teach courses in <strong>lexical semantics, tense and aspect, and speech acts</strong> (with Erving Goffman sharing top billing with J. L. Austin).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I agree with Jim. There's no reason to believe that humans consistently distinguish one kind of information from another, and in fact plenty of reasons to believe they differ greatly in what they take for granted; so the null hypothesis has to be that there is no clear, definitive difference, though certainly there are exemplary cases of one or the other.</p>\n", "Id":"2572", "ParentId":"2571", "LastEditorUserId":"482", "CreationDate":"2012-09-19T05:07:24.700", "OwnerUserId":"482", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-09-20T19:25:38.893", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"263", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler", "Id":"482", "AccountId":"1019614", "CreationDate":"2011-11-04T19:51:14.297", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm a retired linguistics professor. \nI enjoy answering questions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a> at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>My <em>alt.usage.english</em> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar</a> pages</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/NorWesCon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Details and handouts</a> from some recent talks.</li>\n<li>A term paper about K-12 <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/LanguageScience.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Language Science</em></a></li>\n<li>Two <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanned</a> <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210CourspackPart2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">coursepacks</a> from my <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/210.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro Ling class</a>.
