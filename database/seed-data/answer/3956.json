If a word was needed for which the Ancient Hebrew word was not known, great care was taken to scour literature for the word or to incorporate a word that was at least potentially an Ancient Hebrew word using related languages.</li>\n<li>The language is not spoken strictly as \"designed\", with many words and phrases deviating from the original intent.  We can then, at least when feeling pedantic, claim that even if Modern Hebrew <em>were</em> a constructed language, that what is currently spoken in Israel is no longer artificial.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, this certainly isn't \"proof\", and I do not think this may not be the kind of issue that can be settled because everyone will have their own definition of the word \"artificial\".  For example, someone could come along and claim that there is no such thing as an artificial language, or that one language could never be more artificial than another.
