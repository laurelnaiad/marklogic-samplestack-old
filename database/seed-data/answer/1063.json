{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Kaleissin is right that the original Proto-Indo-European root <strong>*mori-, mōri-</strong>, \"sea/swamp/lake?\", was probably just a large body of non-flowing water, be it technically a sea, swamp, or a lake (but not a river). Cognates in English are <em>mere</em> \"sea (obs.), lake/pond (poet./dial.), marsh (dial.)\", <em>marsh</em>, and <em>moor</em>, but Latin <em>mare</em>, \"sea\". For other reflexes see this <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P1329.html\">list at the University of Texas</a>, which is based on Pokorny.

Some suggest it might have come from Proto-Indo-European *<em>sai-</em>, \"sorrow, sore\" (Pokorny). In any case, it appears there is no clear boundary between sea and lake in this root either.</p>\n\n<p>From Kluge's <em>Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache</em>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFDNp.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n", "Id":"1063", "ParentId":"1061", "CreationDate":"2011-11-24T00:16:28.193", "Score":"5", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"82", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-24T00:16:28.193", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"459", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.paleografie.tk", "Location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Id":"82", "DownVotes":"34", "AccountId":"288086", "Views":"69", "Reputation":"5113", "CreationDate":"2011-09-14T00:14:12.070", "DisplayName":"Cerberus", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-18T06:33:05.893", "AboutMe":"<p>I'm your dog for Dutch, Latin, and Greek.</p>\n"}}
