(see the discussion in <em>Aspects of the theory of syntax</em>). Your question seems to presuppose that MP relates to performance, i.e. actual language use. Minimalism is not intended to be an account of the generator/parser, but rather it is intended to be a competence grammar - it models an ideal speaker/hearer's knowledge of language while abstracting away from actual language use (although, naturally, evidence on which a competence grammar is based can only be inferred from actual use). </p>\n\n<p>A minimalist model of the grammar can be used as the basis for a parser or generator - adapting it for a generator would be fairly straight-forward, as derivations proceed 'from the bottom up'. This is probably the basis of your intuition. </p>\n", "Id":"4131", "ParentId":"1622", "CreationDate":"2013-08-07T11:56:11.930", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2328", "LastActivityDate":"2013-08-07T11:56:11.930", "CommentCount":"5"}
