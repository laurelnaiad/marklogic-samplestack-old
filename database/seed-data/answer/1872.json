{"Body":"<p>A popular approach for language identification is to look at character <em>n</em>-grams: consecutive sequences of <em>n</em> characters from the text, and compare the resulting distribution with frequencies drawn from larger corpora of text from each of the candidate languages.</p>\n\n<p>Now, where do the empirical counts come from? Any representative text from the language will do. The <a href=\"http://corpora.uni-leipzig.de/\">University of Leipzig corpus</a> consists of spidered web text for a large number of languages.</p>\n\n<p>The intuition is that particular character sequences are characteristic of particular languages: for example, Dutch text is likely to have <code>ij</code> in it, Italian text should have a decent frequency of <code>it√†</code>, and so on. The distribution of character <em>n</em>-grams is like the signature of a language.</p>\n\n<p>This should be more robust than a dictionary-based method, particularly because a lot of short words are, just by chance, possibly going to occur in more than one language (e.g. <code>in</code>, <code>al</code>, <code>do</code>).</p>\n\n<p>For certain languages which have scripts that are not shared with other languages (e.g. Chinese, although some of its topolects have written forms too), simple heuristics should suffice. Japanese and Chinese can be distinguished by the presence or absence of <em>kana</em>. On the other hand, if the text is romanised, then the character-based method should work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/279_Paper.pdf\">This paper</a> has a basic literature review and concentrates on the harder problem of language identification where the text is very short.</p>\n", "Id":"1872", "ParentId":"1871", "LastEditorUserId":"746", "CreationDate":"2012-05-03T22:48:14.767", "OwnerUserId":"746", "PostTypeId":"2", "comments":[], "LastEditDate":"2012-05-04T06:23:22.250", "LastEditedUser":{"UpVotes":"62", "WebsiteUrl":"http://www.overpunch.com", "Id":"746", "AccountId":"63513", "CreationDate":"2012-02-07T00:29:49.180", "AboutMe":"<p>I am a computational linguistics PhD candidate.
