There are some ambiguous cases, e.g. <em>pilot</em> 'pilot, TV remote'.  A pilot is human and automatically animate.  A TV remote is not, but it also gets the animate genitive accusative.  Strangely enough, there are totally inanimate nouns like <em>papieros</em> 'cigarette, which take a genitive accusative: <em>on pali papierosa</em> 'he's smoking a cigarette'.  We can write off the <em>pilot</em> case on temporal or cultural grounds, but the <em>papieros</em> case sounds like a treatment of animacy as a grammatical category.  If you want to say this makes it no longer animate, I won't argue.</p>\n", "Id":"456", "ParentId":"451", "CreationDate":"2011-09-23T15:20:52.100", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"73", "LastActivityDate":"2011-09-23T15:20:52.100", "CommentCount":"1"}
