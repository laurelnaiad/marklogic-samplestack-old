When they're preceded by an \"s\" they're pronounced pure. Native speakers almost never notice the difference, but it's crucial if you want to pronounce correctly some languages.</p>\n\n<p>Practice reading slowly \"It's Pete's \" versus \"it spits\" and you'll notice the difference in the way the \"p\" sounds: 1st one sounds almost as a soda can being opened at the same time the \"p\" is uttered, such small \"h\" sound is the aspirated which is missing in the second one.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise with \"It's Top Cat!\" versus \"it stops\".</p>\n", "Id":"6274", "ParentId":"11", "CreationDate":"2013-12-29T17:05:06.690", "Score":"0", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2785", "LastActivityDate":"2013-12-29T17:05:06.690", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"79", "WebsiteUrl":"http://stackoverflow.com/users/21258/joe-pineda", "ProfileImageUrl":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3829797d6709334d9a07fe18dfcb553f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "Id":"2785", "AccountId":"11104", "CreationDate":"2013-11-26T03:56:44.347", "AboutMe":"<p>Developing professionally since 11 years ago.
