{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>In your example sentence <em>Pete wants to paint</em>, the word combination <em>wants to paint</em> is a simple finite verb phrase. But in the similar example <em>Pete wants to paint the house</em>, one can no longer claim that <em>wants to paint</em> is a verb phrase, since it no longer qualifies as a phrase (constituent) due to the presence of <em>the house</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Thus to answer the question directly, there is no established term in theoretical syntax that clearly denotes a word combination consisting of a finite verb plus a <em>to</em>-infinitive. However in school grammar, many grammar teachers nevertheless call such a combination a <em>verb phrase</em>. The phrase concept is much more flexible in school grammar than it is in theoretical syntax.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, a relatively new term that theoretical syntax employs to denote the word combination like <em>wants to paint</em>; it is a verb <em>catena</em>. See the following article:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catena_%28linguistics%29</a></p>\n\n<p>The catena is a much more flexible unit of syntax than the phrase/constituent. Many word combinations that are not phrases or constituents but are relevant to various phenomena of syntax are catenae. </p>\n", "Id":"4002", "ParentId":"3283", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T18:44:52.877", "Score":"2", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"2247", "LastActivityDate":"2013-07-14T18:44:52.877", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"5", "DownVotes":"1", "Id":"2247", "AccountId":"3045491", "Views":"34", "Reputation":"565", "CreationDate":"2013-07-14T16:52:54.170", "DisplayName":"Tim Osborne", "LastAccessDate":"2014-01-01T04:26:20.267"}}
