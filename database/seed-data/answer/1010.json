{"comments":[], "Body":"<p>Following up on jlovegren's point that head directionality does not empirically hold:</p>\n\n<p>Anders Holmberg and other researchers have been attempting to sharpen the analytical relevance of mixed order languages such as Finnish into the <a href=\"http://research.ncl.ac.uk/linearization/papers.php\">Final Over Final Constraint</a> which states, paraphrased very loosely, that head-finality is restricted to positions where it only dominates head-final structures. Hence mixed order languages can have head-final configurations up to some point in the (relevant) syntactic structure, where it switches to being head-initial.</p>\n\n<p>As support of this proposal, <a href=\"http://research.ncl.ac.uk/linearization/BHR_2010.pdf\">Biberauer, Holmberg, &amp; Roberts 2010:19-21</a> point out the observation from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/rz5jeh\">Holmberg 2000</a> that while both postpositions and prepositions are present in Finnish, a postpositional phrase involving a complex NP is ungrammatical:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1a. ennen  sotaa\n    before war\n    `before the war'\n1b. sodan jälkeen \n    war   after\n    `after the war'\n2a. ennen  [käyntiä [nurkan takana]]\n    before [visit   [corner behind]]\n   `before the visit around the corner'\n2b. *[käynnin [nurkan takana]] jälkeen\n     [visit   [corner behind]] after\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Under their analysis, (2b) is ungrammatical because it involves a head-initial NP embedded within a head-final PP.</p>\n", "Id":"1010", "ParentId":"1007", "CreationDate":"2011-11-11T05:49:33.097", "Score":"4", "PostTypeId":"2", "OwnerUserId":"397", "LastActivityDate":"2011-11-11T05:49:33.097", "OwnerUser":{"UpVotes":"50", "DownVotes":"86", "Id":"397", "AccountId":"959564", "Views":"7", "Reputation":"680", "CreationDate":"2011-10-07T14:54:31.260", "DisplayName":"Aerlinthe", "LastAccessDate":"2013-12-10T17:42:44.790"}}
