### Landing Page [landing-page](./landing-page.feature)

The landing page displays all documents that someone is allowed to see, sorted by descending document score.

Anyone who launches the application will be entered into the [List QnA Documents](../list-qna-documents/list-qna-documents.md) feature having no specified filter criteria, search criteria or sort order. Defaults will thus be applied.

*Note: this does **not** apply to cases where someone specifies a URL path or query parameters as they enter the application.*
