* npm install
* bower install
* gulp <command>

<command> may be `build`, `unit`, `run`, `watch`.

In run and watch mode, you may use these URLs:

[https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) -- view the running app.
Livereload is enabled by a script embedded in the app so changes should
be instantly seen in a browser.

[https://localhost:3001/unit-runner.html](https://localhost:3001/unit-runner.html) -- run
unit tests within the browser.  Unit tests are run upon build and upon changes
during watch mode using PhantomJS and results are reported in the console.
It may also be useful to run the tests from within the browser to debug.
