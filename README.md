# samplestack

An application to demonstrate using MarkLogic in a Java Application Server environment.

## Usage


```bash
git clone https://github.com/marklogic/samplestack-java.git
```

**One-time setup**:

* install MarklLogic
* build and install ML java client from trunk as Maven package.. in a separate directory:
** git clone https://github.com/marklogic/java-client-api
** cd java-client-api
** mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install
* **install node/npm**
* `npm install -g bower`
* `npm install -g gulp`
* `cd browser`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

**Development Steps**:

*(Do these the first time you run.  You may need to repeat them if you pull
code changes in the future)*

* clear MarkLogic data directory and start MarkLogic Server
with fresh data dir
* `./gradlew assemble`
* `./gradlew fooconfig`

*(in a separate terminal session...)*

* `cd browser`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

**To run Java unit tests**:

* `./gradlew test`

**To run the Java application**:

* `./gradlew boot` -- builds and runs the app (on localhost:8080) and enters
watch mode (subsequent changes are instantaneously applied to the running
server)

**To run the Angular unit tests and launch the web application**
(in a separate terminal):

* `cd browser`
* `gulp unit`
* `gulp run`
