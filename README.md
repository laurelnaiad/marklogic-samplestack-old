# sampleStack

## Usage


```bash
git clone https://github.com/marklogic/samplestack-java.git
```

One-time setup:

* install and start MarkLogic with fresh data dir
* build and install ML java client from trunk as Maven package TODO - put on maven central
* `./gradlew assemble`
* **install node**

To run unit tests:
